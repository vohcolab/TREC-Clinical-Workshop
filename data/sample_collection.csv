NCT00000408,Low Back Pain Patient Education Evaluation,"
      Back pain is one of the most common of all symptoms. It is also a great cause of days lost
      from work and visits to health care providers. This study will develop and evaluate an
      approach to low back pain that allows subjects to talk with each other and with health
      professionals via an Internet discussion group. Results we will look at include health
      behaviors, such as exercise; health status, such as pain and disability; and health care
      use, such as number of visits to doctors and other health care providers. Anyone 18 years
      old or older who lives in the United States and has ongoing Internet access can take part in
      the study. All subjects must have back pain and meet the eligibility criteria listed below.

      To determine whether the regular administration of the beta-blocker drug propranolol to
      people who had had at least one documented myocardial infarction would result in a
      significant reduction of mortality from all causes over the follow-up period. Eligible
      volunteer patients were recruited to participate in a double-blind clinical trial within 21
      days after the onset of the acute event. One-half of the patients were randomly assigned to
      a beta-blocking drug (propranolol) and one-half to a placebo. The trial also evaluated the
      effect of propranolol on incidences of coronary heart disease mortality, sudden cardiac
      death, and nonfatal myocardial infarction plus coronary heart disease mortality in persons
      with documented previous myocardial infarction.

NCT00001853,Diabetes and Heart Disease Risk in Blacks,"
      It is unknown if obesity contributes to the development of heart disease in African American
      men and women.

      This study was created to determine whether there is a relationship between sex and body
      size and the incidence of heart disease in African American men and women. Researchers will
      attempt to associate obesity with the presence of heart disease risk factors. Risk factors
      that will be studied include; total body fat, body fat distribution, fat content of the
      blood (triglyceride concentration, low density lipoproteins [LDL], and high density
      lipoproteins [HDL]), how fast fat is removed from the blood, and how well insulin works in
      the body.

      Scientific studies have shown that obesity and increased levels of fat content in the blood
      are important risk factors for heart disease in Caucasian women. However, similar studies in
      African American women have failed to show the same correlation. In fact, it appears that
      African American women in all three body weight groupings, nonobese, overweight, and obese
      experience high death rates due to heart disease. In addition, prior research has shown that
      obese African American men tend to have elevated levels of fat in the blood while African
      American women have normal blood fat levels. Therefore, if high levels of triglycerides (fat
      found in the blood) are not seen in non-diabetic obese African American women, it cannot be
      considered a risk factor in this population. This suggests that studies conducted on
      Caucasian women may not provide insight into heart disease risk factors in African American
      women.

      The study will take 120 healthy nondiabetic African American men and women (ages 18-50)
      grouped by sex (60 men and 60 women) and body mass index 3 subgroups; nonobese, overweight
      and obese). Diabetes undeniably increases the risk of heart disease. Therefore patients
      suffering from diabetes will not be included in the study. Candidates for the study will
      undergo a series of tests and examinations over 5 outpatient visits. Subjects will have body
      fat analyses, resting energy expenditure measurements, an EKG (electrocardiogram), and
      specific blood tests.

      Researchers believe this study will provide significant insight into the causes of obesity
      and heart disease in African Americans.

      Patients with end-stage renal failure have a markedly higher mortality because of
      cardiovascular events in comparison with the normal population. Disorders in the calcium
      metabolism, such as calcification of the vessel walls, occur very frequently. There are
      indications that calcium channel blockers are capable of lowering the cardiovascular
      mortality in patients with end-stage renal failure.

      It is intended to carry out a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      multicenter study in order to find out if the calcium channel blocker amlodipine is able to
      reduce the mortality of patients with end-stage renal failure.

      The investigation will be carried out after suitable explanation and written informed
      consent in 356 patients aged between 18 and 90 years with end-stage renal failure and
      chronic haemodialysis treatment. The patients will be randomized to either treatment with

      Ⅱ receptor-1 blockers (ARBs) for hypertensive patients with diabetes on the basis of the
      cardiac- and reno-protective effects of these drugs. However, these recommendations could
      not be extrapolated to Japanese patients, because Japan has been known as a country with a
      low incidence of coronary artery disease and a high incidence of cerebrovascular disease.
      Furthermore, calcium channel blockers (CCBs) also were protective against renal function as
      well as ACE inhibitors in Japanese diabetic hypertensive patients. This study will test
      whether ARBs or CCBs are superior in treating Japanese diabetic hypertensive patients.

NCT00166231,Understanding Pediatric Chest Pain and Other Symptoms,"
      The causes of pediatric pain are often not the same for every child. Most children who visit
      a cardiology specialist with complaints of chest or other somatic pain have no known medical
      diagnosis to explain their symptoms. These children and their families often leave with no
      explanation for the child's distress.

      This early study will ask parents and children specific questions related to the stress in
      their lives, their emotional well-being and the children's physical functioning. The
      investigators want children who experience chest and other somatic pain, and those who do
      not, to be in their study so that they can look at both groups.

      The investigators hope to use these answers to better inform cardiologists who often work
      with children with non-cardiac pain and, in turn, help them to better serve their patients.
      Ultimately, the investigators hope that the answers they get will provide answers to these
      families. They also hope to use the results of this study to put together a short screener
      for the cardiologist to give to pediatric patients with complaints of chest or other somatic
      pain to help the cardiologists better understand their patients' symptoms.

NCT00175279,A Cluster Randomized Trial to Assess the Impact of Opinion Leader Endorsed Evidence Summaries on Improving Quality of Prescribing for Patients With Chronic Cardiovascular Disease,"
      BACKGROUND: Although much has been written about the influence of local opinion leaders on
      clinical practice, there have been few controlled studies of their effect, and almost none
      have attempted to change prescribing in the community for chronic conditions such as
      congestive heart failure (CHF) or ischemic heart disease (IHD). These two conditions are
      common and there is very good evidence about how to best prevent morbidity and mortality -
      and very good evidence that quality of care is, in general, suboptimal. Practice audits have
      demonstrated that about half of eligible CHF patients are prescribed ACE inhibitors (and
      fewer still reaching appropriate target doses) and less than one-third of patients with
      established IHD are prescribed statins (with many fewer reaching recommended cholesterol
      targets). It is apparent that interventions to improve quality of prescribing are urgently
      needed.

      HYPOTHESIS: An intervention that consists of patient-specific one-page evidence summaries,
      generated and then endorsed by local opinion leaders, will be able to change prescribing
      practices of community-based primary care physicians.

      DESIGN: A single centre randomized controlled trial comparing an opinion leader intervention
      to usual care. Based on random allocation of all physicians in one large Canadian health
      region, patients with CHF or IHD (not receiving ACE inhibitors or statins, respectively)
      recruited from community pharmacies will be allocated to intervention or usual care. The
      primary outcome is improvement in prescription of proven efficacious therapies for CHF (ACE
      inhibitors) or IHD (statins) within 6 months of the intervention.

      Osteoporosis or ""thinning of the bones"" affects in 1 in 4 Canadian women and 1 in 8 Canadian
      men. Moreover, while the rates of osteoporosis among Canadians are stabilizing, worldwide
      the number of people afflicted with osteoporosis continues to rise. The most serious
      complication of osteoporosis is a broken bone or fracture. Fractures due to osteoporosis can
      result in long hospital stays, dependence on others, and premature death. While there are
      several medications that prevent osteoporosis they all have side effects. For example,
      postmenopausal women who take hormone replacement therapy (HRT) are at increased risk of
      breast cancer and heart disease. In addition, drugs to prevent osteoporosis are expensive
      and not available worldwide. Therefore, it is essential that researchers continue to
      identify and test new medications for the prevention of osteoporosis.

      The purpose of the research is to determine if nitrates, a group of drugs that are widely
      available, inexpensive, and commonly used to treat chest pain or angina, can prevent
      osteoporosis in women. If the researchers find that nitrates prevent osteoporosis, a widely
      available, inexpensive treatment for osteoporosis prevention that does not have any long

      The estimated recurrence rate of primary spontaneous pneumothorax is 23-50% after the first
      episode, and the optimal treatment remains unknown. In the recently published British
      Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines, simple aspiration is recommended as first line treatment
      for all primary pneumothoraces requiring intervention. However, the 1 year recurrence rate
      of this procedure was as high as 25-30%, making it inappropriate as a standard of care.

      Intrapleural instillation of a chemical irritant (chemical pleurodesis) is an effective way
      to shorten the duration of air leaks and reduce the rates of recurrent spontaneous
      pneumothorax in surgical and non-surgical patients. Many chemical irritants (tetracycline,
      talc, and minocycline) have been used to decrease the rate of recurrence in spontaneous
      pneumothorax. Tetracycline, which was the most commonly used irritant, is no longer
      available. Talc insufflation of the pleural cavity is safe and effective for primary
      spontaneous pneumothorax. However, it should be applied either with surgical or medical
      thoracoscopy. Minocycline, a derivative of tetracycline, is as effective as tetracycline in
      inducing pleural fibrosis in rabbits. In the previous studies, we have shown that additional
      minocycline pleurodesis is a safe and convenient procedure to decrease the rates of
      ipsilateral recurrence after thoracoscopic treatment of primary spontaneous pneumothorax. In
      the present study, additional minocycline pleurodesis will be randomly administered in
      patients with first episode of primary spontaneous pneumothorax after simple aspiration to

      Acute chest pain is a common cause of hospital admission. Active approaches are directed
      towards diagnosis and treatment of potentially life threatening conditions, especially acute
      coronary syndrome and coronary artery disease. However, a considerable number of patients
      may have chest pain caused by biomechanical dysfunction of muscles and joints of the chest
      wall or the cervical and thoracic spine (20%). The diagnostic approaches and treatment
      options for this group of patients are scarce and there is a lack of formal clinical studies
      and validated outcome measures addressing the effect of manual treatment approaches.

      Objective: This single blind randomized clinical trial investigates whether chiropractic
      treatment can reduce pain and improve function in a population of patients with acute,
      musculoskeletal chest pain when compared to advice directed towards promoting
      self-management.

      Methods: Among patients admitted to a chest pain clinic in a university hospital under
      suspicion of acute coronary syndrome, 120 patients with an episode of acute chest pain of
      musculoskeletal origin are included in the study. All patients have completed the chest pain
      clinic diagnostic procedures, and acute coronary syndrome and other obvious reasons for
      chest pain have been excluded. After completion of the study evaluation program, the

      known whether one drug is more effective than the other in lessening pleurodesis-related
      pain or whether the size of the chest drain tube affects pain.

      PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying ibuprofen to see how well it works
      compared with morphine in treating pain in patients undergoing pleurodesis for malignant
      pleural effusion.

NCT00683813,Trial of a Cardiac Rehabilitation Program Delivered Remotely Through the Internet,"
      Cardiac rehabilitation programs (CRP) are a proven treatment for those with ischemic heart
      disease (IHD). These programs have been demonstrated to improve adherence to regular
      physical activity, a healthy diet and smoking cessation, as well as modify risk factors for
      IHD such as hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, obesity and type 2 diabetes. In addition,
      CRP are cost effective and can result in a 25% reduction in reoccurrence of mortality.
      Despite the known benefits of CRP, as little as 10% to 25% of eligible patients attend these
      programs. One of the main barriers to attendance is proximity to a CRP, as the majority of
      these programs are limited to hospitals in large urban areas. However, cardiovascular
      diseases do not discriminate by geography, resulting in a geographic inequity of care for
      patients living in rural, remote and smaller urban/sub-urban centres. Currently there are no
      CRP specifically designed for patients in rural and remote areas. The use of the Internet
      may present itself as a viable alternative. We have recently completed a pilot study of a
      virtual CRP (vCRP) that demonstrated significant improvements in exercise capacity and risk
      factors. This investigation will study the vCRP in a group of IHD patients who do not have
      access to hospital-based CRP.

      Hypotheses A. Participation in a 4 month Internet-based cardiac rehabilitation program will
      result in significant improvements in exercise capacity compared to usual care, in patients
      with diagnosed IHD.

      B. Participation in a 4 month Internet-based cardiac rehabilitation program will result in
      significant improvements in exercise capacity after one year compared to usual care, in
      patients with diagnosed IHD.

      Study Population Men and women over 18 years will be identified from consecutive in-patients
      of the British Columbia Provincial Heart Centre at St. Paul's Hospital in Vancouver who
      reside in either the Northern Interior or Coast Garibaldi health areas. Patients will be
      eligible if they have IHD, Internet access, no previous experience with cardiac
      rehabilitation and no physical limitations to exercise. A total of 74 patients (37 per
      group) will be recruited and randomized to either usual care, or a 4 month 'virtual' cardiac
      rehabilitation program delivered via the Internet.

      Usual Care Group Patients randomized to usual care will be provided with simple guidelines
      for safe exercising and healthy eating habits, and return to the care of their primary care
      physician. Patients will return at 4 and 16 months later for outcome assessment. There will
      be no contact between the study personnel and usual care patients for the duration of the
      study, nor will there be any attempt to control the level of patient care.

      Intervention The vCRP has been developed to mimic hospital-based CRP and includes online
      intake forms, one-on-one chat sessions with vCRP nurse, dietitian and exercise specialist,
      data collection (exercise heart rate, blood pressure, glucose- if diabetic), peer-support
      group chat sessions, ask-an-expert chat sessions, education, progress reports and online
      resources. Upon randomization to the intervention, patients will receive access to the
      website, a heart rate monitor and a blood pressure monitor and trained in their use. The
      heart rate monitors allow for exercise heart rate data to be stored and downloaded to their
      home computer and then uploaded to the vCRP webserver. The exercise data will be reviewed
      weekly. A letter to the patient's primary care physician will be sent to outline the vCRP
      intervention, the treatment algorithms to be used and indicate under what circumstances the
      vCRP nurse and/or patient may contact them with regards to their management. Patients will
      receive one-on-one counselling by the nurse, dietitian and exercise specialist via chat
      sessions at 3 to 4 week intervals. After the 4 month intervention, patients will be
      discharged into the care of their primary care physician.

      Outcomes Participants will be assessed at baseline, 4 and 16 months for risk factors and
      lifestyle behaviours. The primary outcomes will be the change in exercise capacity as
      between the two groups from baseline to 4 months, and from baseline to 16 months. Exercise
      capacity will be assessed as total time on a symptom-limited exercise stress test.

NCT00705952,Group Lifestyle Intervention for People With New Onset Type 2 Diabetes.,"
      The purpose of the study is to assess whether weight loss achieved through a programme of
      intensive lifestyle management can result in enhanced production of Glucagon-Like Peptide-1
      (GLP-1) together with improvements in the release of insulin and glucagon and thus
      improvements in glycaemic control (HbA1c), in patients with new onset type 2 diabetes.

      This is a cohort study with comparisons made between assessments at baseline, after an
      initial four months of intensive intervention and after a further four months follow up
      (maintenance period). Each patient will participate in the study for 8 month. The entire
      study period will be 24 months.

      All patients with new onset type 2 diabetes (within 2 weeks of diagnosis) will be recruited
      from those referred to the Type 2 Diabetes Education Programme in the community (""FOCUS""),
      as per standard practice. The investigators will also hope to recruit direct from local GP
      surgeries who will be advised of the study. At this point, patients will be given a study
      information sheet with a contact number if they wish to participate in the study.

      Individuals who are unable to give consent, who would be unable to attend all the programme
      sessions for medical or other reasons, who are prescribed oral hypoglycaemic, antiobesity or
      any other prescription medications that may interfere with the study results or whose BMI is
      < 25, will be excluded. The investigators will also exclude those who cannot converse
      competently in English as special arrangements would need to be made for such people
      attending the programme and this would be impractical in a group setting.

      Those willing to participate will be invited for an individual appointment with the
      dietitian, during which the study structure, aims and procedures will be explained and
      consent to participate in the study will be obtained. For the first session of the
      programme, participants will be asked to attend following an overnight fast. Blood samples
      will be taken for basal measurement of glucose, HbA1c, lipids, insulin, glucagon, GLP-1,
      leptin, ghrelin and adiponectin. They will then be given a standard 75 g glucose load and
      sampling repeated at 30 mins (for peak GLP-1 levels). Baseline measurements of weight,
      height, percent body fat, waistline circumference and blood pressure will also be taken
      during this session. Following the assessment, patients will participate in the first
      session of the education programme. The full assessment will be repeated at 4 and 8 months
      intervals.

      The weight management programme will be run by the Specialist Dietitian. It will consist of
      2 phases: an initial 4 month intensive weight loss phase, followed by a 4 month weight loss
      / maintenance phase. The initial four month programme will consist of 8 group education
      sessions and at least 3 phone calls. The following 4 month programme will consist of 5 group
      sessions, at least 3 phone calls and 1 individual appointment. Each education session will
      last 60min. Before the 1st session and, at 4 month and 8 month sessions, bloods will be
      taken, as above. Before the rest of the sessions, there will be 15 minutes devoted to weight
      assessment. The programme will be based on portion control and healthy eating and will be
      supported by behavioural and cognitive change interventions. Such interventions will include
      self monitoring, stimulus control, goal setting, problem solving and relapse prevention. The
      specialists from ""Bournemouth HealthLink"" (a partnership backed by the local NHS, Council
      and University) will take part in helping participants to increase their activity levels.

      The aim is to achieve weight loss of 5% over the first 4 months with, as a minimum, weight
      maintenance or possible further reduction over the subsequent four months.

NCT00745043,Beta-Blocker in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Study,"
      Smoking causes both smoking related lung disease (COPD) and ischaemic heart disease. These
      are very common conditions and many patients have both diseases. Beta-blocker drugs are
      extensively used in the treatment of angina, high blood pressure and after heart attacks to
      decrease symptoms and prolong life. Beta-agonists are used in COPD to decrease
      breathlessness and improve exercise tolerance. It used to be thought that beta-blockers
      cannot be used in COPD patients as they may make the breathlessness worse, but it has now
      been established that they can be used safely. Beta-blocker drugs and beta-agonists have
      'opposite' effects on the body and the investigators do not know if they can work together
      or if they would cancel each other out. The investigators also do not know which of the
      different types of beta-blockers now available are better for COPD patients. This study will
      investigate what happens to the airways of people taking both of these drugs.

      objective was to investigate the effectiveness of neuromuscular balance in lumbar pain. The
      12 patients, with age between 20 and 55 years, whose did five consultations, with 100%

      movement. Even after the relief of the pain, 7(58,3%) of the patients kept the treatment for
      a more effective rehabilitation and prevention of repetition of the symptoms. It was
      concluded that the neuromuscular balance relieved quickly the pain, being essential for

NCT00808652,Prevalence and Outcome of Brachial Artery Endothelial Function in Morbidly Obese Patients Undergoing Bariatric Surgery,"
      The relation between obesity and ischemic heart disease (IHD) is under considerable debate.
      The reduction in all-cause mortality and, more specifically, the reduction in
      cardiac-related mortality seen after weight-loss surgery, may be due to regression or
      slowing developement of subclinical IHD. Function of cells lining the arteries (endothelium)
      is closely related to the state of IHD and its measurement can serve as a surrogate marker
      for the existence and severity of IHD. The investigators hypothesize that the prevalence of
      undiagnosed IHD in the morbidly obese population is high and that following surgery for
      weight reduction there is a halt in the progression, or even a regression in its severity.

      The study includes measurement of endothelial function before and after weight-reducing
      surgery.

NCT00809029,The Influence Of GIP (Glucose-Dependent Insulinotropic Polypeptide) Infusion On Human Adipose Tissue: An In Vivo Study,"
      Study part-1

      GIP (glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide) is one of the two main incretin hormones
      secreted by specialized cells of the gastrointestinal tract in response to ingestion of
      nutrients. Data emerging from studies in animal models and cultured human fat cells support
      a physiological role for GIP in the adipose tissue metabolism which may contribute to the
      pathogenesis of obesity.

      The proposed study will shed more light on the interactions between gut hormones and adipose
      tissue. For this pilot study, male subjects fulfilling the inclusion criteria will be given
      GIP or placebo infusions in a randomized manner. Fat tissue biopsies will be obtained from
      all subjects during both visits, once in the basal state (before the start of the
      peptide/placebo infusion) and then repeated at the end of the period of infusion.

      Study part-2

      Surgery represents the most effective therapeutic modality for morbid obesity. Resolution of
      type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has been consistently observed as an additional benefit of
      surgical treatment of obesity. The mechanisms underlying the dramatic effects of surgery on
      insulin sensitivity and β-cell function are poorly understood. Bariatric surgery (gastric
      bypass) promotes changes in the enteroendocrine system as a result of nutrient diversion
      from the physiological intestinal routes with subsequent profound modification of gut
      hormone secretion

      We hypothesize that restoration of GIP action after bariatric procedures plays a cardinal
      role in the improvement and/or restoration of diabetes, we propose to study patients (both
      sex)with morbid obesity and T2DM within 3 months after their surgery. Their responses will
      be compared to those of BMI matched control subjects with normal glucose tolerance

NCT00832442,Collaborative Systematic Overview of Randomised Controlled Trials of Beta-Blockers in the Treatment of Heart Failure,"
      Several large trials have shown that beta-blocker treatment reduces the risk of death and
      hospital admission in patients with symptomatic heart failure. Unfortunately, survey data
      suggests relatively poor utilisation of beta-blockers, despite ample evidence for good
      tolerability. Additionally there are several important unanswered questions, such as
      clinical efficacy for specific sub-populations (women, the elderly and patients with
      diabetes or other co-morbidities) and the effect of beta-blockers in combination with other
      medications. Previous meta-analyses, based on published tabular data, have been conducted
      although this approach has important biases and limitations.

      We plan to perform a carefully conducted systematic review of individual patient data from
      the major randomised trials of beta-blockers in heart failure. The goals of this
      collaborative project are to clarify the overall efficacy of beta-blockers and identify
      sub-groups that show particular benefit, thereby increasing the use of beta-blockers,
      reducing adverse clinical outcomes and the high costs associated with this condition.

      (Waddell, 1987), with a point prevalence of up to 30 percent (O'Sullivan, 2005; Waddell,
      1987). Low back pain has severe economic ramifications. Most incidents of low back pain
      occur during the prime working years of life, with an estimated cost to the economy at
      $14,744 Canadian dollars per person per year (Health Canada, 1998). Indirect costs in the
      form of long-term disability were highest for disorders of arthritis and chronic back pain
      (Health Canada, 1998). It has been estimated that 12 percent of patients will experience
      disability within one year after their first episode of low back pain (Banner, 2006).

      Clopidogrel can reduce risk of cardiovascular disease by inhibiting platelet aggregation. It
      is metabolized to an active drug by a liver enzyme. Its efficacy may be measured by blood
      sampling for platelet activity, analyzed by VerifyNow device. Calcium Channel blocker (CCB)
      is also commonly used for blood pressure and anginal control in these patients.
      Dihydropyridine group of calcium channel blocker (e.g. amlodipine) inhibits this enzyme.
      There are observational studies reporting dihydropyridine CCB reducing clopidogrel effect,
      but the clinical implication is unclear.

      This study test the hypothesis that there is no significant effect of dihydropyridines CCB
      on clopidogrel response compared with control. After giving consent, patients with
      suboptimal blood pressure or anginal control will be randomized to receive either
      dihydropyridine CCB or non-CCB as placebo. These patient will be follow-up in 1 month.

NCT01216020,Cetuximab Plus Radiotherapy Versus Cisplatin Plus Radiotherapy in Locally Advanced Head and Neck Cancer,"
      BACKGROUND:

      Concomitant radiotherapy and cisplatin (CDDP) based chemotherapy is the standard treatment
      for LA-NHSCC. This combined modality treatment is linked with considerable acute local and
      systemic toxicity.EGFR is overexpressed in 90-100% of the HNSCC cases and is considered an
      unfavourable prognostic marker. EGFR costitutive activation is linked with HNSCC
      pathogenesis.

      Cetuximab is a monoclonal anti-EGFR antibody blocking the activation of the receptor and
      signal transduction. Cetuximab combined with radiotherapy is superior to radiotherapy only
      in the treatment of LA-HNSCC and is characterized by an acceptable toxicity profile.

      RATIONALE:

      A direct comparison between concomitant chemoradiotherapy with Cisplatin and the concomitant
      treatment with radiotherapy associated to cetuximab does not exist.

      STUDY DESIGN:

      Arm A: Radical radiotherapy (doses and volumes) concomitant with chemotherapy with Cisplatin
      (40 mg/mq/week) Arm B: Radical radiotherapy (doses and volumes) concomitant with therapy
      with the monoclonal antibody Cetuximab (400 mg/m2 [""loading dose""] and subsequently 250 mg

NCT01231165,Treatment of Coronary Heart Disease With Amiloride,"
      Treatment of coronary artery disease is a major health care problem across the entire word,
      and the United States. Unfortunately, despite a number of medical advances, diagnostic
      procedure, or epidemiological studies, the treatment of these patients remain complex, and
      and at times frustrating. In fact, the COURAGE trial conducted in 50 centers across United
      States and Canada documented that drug treatment, coronary interventions or both were not
      effective solution in coronary artery diseases.

      A novel approach has recently been developed, based on the critical role of the potassium
      (K) content in red-blood-cell in myocardial oxygenation, since oxygen and K binding by
      hemoglobin (red-blood-cell) occurs simultaneously in blood passing through the lungs,
      whereas in the organs as the heart, the hemoglobin release both Oxygen and K ions.

      This apparently simple mechanisms occurs in human blood in all individuals but could be
      altered in subjects with acquired or hereditable defect in red-blood-cell K content. The
      purpose of this trial, thus, will be to evaluate the pharmacological effects of Amiloride on
      RBC K-uptake and transport and its impact on reversion of angina, electrocardiographic
      changes of myocardial ischemia and electrical regeneration of the heart in subjects with

      Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of mortality in our countries.
      Clinically, symptoms could be chest pain suggesting stable angina. Atherosclerosis is
      influenced by cardiovascular risk factors which obesity (Body Mass Index>30). Obesity is
      associated with an increase risk of cardiovascular complications.

      Lipoprotein(a) is regarded as an independent risk factor for premature cardiovascular
      disease. Lp(a) is composed of low-density lipoprotein - like particle bound to glycoprotein
      molecule: apolipoprotein(a). Plasma levels are determinated to more than 90% by genetic
      factors (no significant influence of statin, weight, lifestyle factor: diet, exercise). Two
      study with few patients have found that aspirin lowers serum Lp(a) levels. Elevated Lp(a) is
      a risk factor for recurrent coronary events in obese patient.

      Atherosclerosis is associated with imbalance of coagulation. TFPI (tissue factor pathway
      inhibitor) is the earliest inhibitor of the blood coagulation process, natural direct
      inhibitor of tissue factor. In-vitro, TFPI activity is inhibited by high Lp(a) .

      It is supposed that the significant metabolic effects (improvement of insulin sensitivity)
      of hypertension therapy with renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers in humans are mediated
      mainly via changes in abdominal adipose tissue. This project is aimed to confirm the
      hypothesis that increased concentrations of circulatory angiotensin II after angiotensin II
      receptor type I (AT1) blockade leads, via stimulation of angiotensin II receptor type II
      (AT2), to activation of adipogenesis and improvement of insulin sensitivity. Therefore, in
      hypertensive patients, the components of RAS and the parameters of insulin sensitivity on
      systemic (in plasma) and local (in adipose tissue and in its interstitial fluid) level will
      be studied. The main aim of the study is to identify the changes occurring in patient before

      Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) is associated with inadequate drainage of the aqueous
      humor via the trabecular meshwork towards the systemic circulation. This may lead to an

      loss. Firstline treatment usually includes IOP-lowering drug therapy. However, if IOP
      remains uncontrolled and/or the optic nerve damage progresses despite controlled IOP,
      surgery may be indicated. Deep sclerectomy with a collagen implant (DSCI) is a
      non-penetrating surgical procedure for the treatment of open angle glaucoma that allows the

      including risk factors, cardiovascular exam, resting ECG, chest x-ray, and exercise ECG. CT
      calcium scoring (CTCS) is a technique that is very sensitive in identifying and quantifying
      calcified atherosclerotic plaques. Recent guidance from the National Institute of Clinical
      Excellence (NICE, citation 1) proposes the use of CTCS in patients with stable chest pain
      who have low likelihood of coronary artery disease (CAD). They recommend that patients with
      low likelihood (10-30%) have a CTCS and if the score is 0, they can be considered to have
      non-cardiac chest pain. However, there is controversy regarding relationship of absent
      calcification with significant CAD and its prognostic value.

      At our institution, we have been performing CTCS in this patient cohort since 2003. We plan
      to retrospectively review the usefulness in CTCS in patients with different likelihood for
      significant CAD, particularly in patients with absent calcium and compare with the

      affect the way the blood forms clots. Minorities, such as African-Americans are
      underrepresented. Therefore, we are conducting this platelet reactivity study to better
      understand if there are differences in how this drug affects African-Americans from how they
      affect Caucasian patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention and receiving
      ticagrelor. These data will be compared to a historical control of Caucasian patients who
      underwent similar platelet function testing.

      This was a clinical effectiveness trial designed to compare the effectiveness, safety, and
      tolerability of treatment with tapentadol prolonged release with that of oxycodone/naloxone
      prolonged release in non-opioid pre-treated subjects with severe chronic low back pain with
      a neuropathic pain component.

      Both tapentadol and the opioid oxycodone are effective in chronic severe pain and tapentadol
      and oxycodone/naloxone have shown advantages in gastrointestinal tolerability versus
      oxycodone. Therefore, it was of high scientific interest to compare the latter 2 analgesics
      with respect to gastrointestinal tolerability. Tapentadol may have advantages regarding the
      neuropathic pain-related symptoms of low back pain due to its 2 mechanisms of action.

NCT01879293,Metformin Reduces Left Ventricular Mass in Patients With Ischemic Heart Disease,"
      Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death in the world. Most of the attention
      in treating ischemic heart disease (IHD) is understandably directed toward treating coronary
      artery disease. However there are other treatable culprits in these patients.

      Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is widespread in IHD patients, even in the absence of
      hypertension. It is a strong predictor of cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality. In
      one study, the presence of LVH was a stronger predictor of mortality than either multivessel
      cor-onary disease or impaired LV function.

      Metformin is an antihyperglycemic agent with a history of successful use in type 2 diabetes.
      In the UKPDS (United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study), metformin was associated with a
      39% lower risk of myocardial infarction compared with conventional therapy. Metformin also
      offered dual benefits of improving vascular function and lessening ischemia in nondiabetic
      patients.

      Hence, the main aim of this study was to assess whether metformin could regress LVM in
      patients with IHD. The secondary aim was to assess the effect of metformin on LV volumes and
      endothelial function in this patient group.

      Background: Syndrome differentiation is one of the substantial characteristics in
      Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) but is still lack of scientific evidence. The inference
      methods of causal relationship between treatment and clinical effect under real-world study
      may help.

      Objectives: This study aims to assess the efficacy of Phlegm and Stasis Syndrome
      differentiation method in treating resistant hypertension and explore causal inference in
      the real-world study.

      Research design and methods: It is a multicenter, prospective, two-arm, cohort study
      including 200 patients with resistant hypertension (doctors' diagnosis based on the American
      Heart Association criteria 2008). Essential hypertension subjects, aged 18-70 years, blood
      pressure > 140/90 mm Hg even used to be on 3 or more medications for a month and diagnosed
      as Phlegm and Stasis Syndrome will be included. Thiazide diuretics and/or two more
      antihypertensive agents for 8 weeks, Chinese herbs (for synchronic treating phlegm and blood
      stasis) and nonpharmacological recommendations were initiated in the observational group and
      the control group received the same interventions without Chinese herbs.

      Outcome measures: The primary outcomes will be Systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood
      pressure reductions and changes in symptoms and signs. Cardiac event and death incident will
      be the secondary outcomes. Possible side effects and adverse reactions arising from the
      treatment like diarrhea will be recorded.

NCT02011646,Healthy Body Study,"
      Few obesity prevention programs have produced weight gain prevention effects that persist
      over long-term follow-up and those that have are extremely lengthy, averaging 52 hr in
      duration, making implementation difficult and costly. The 2010 US Preventative Services Task
      Force (USPSTF) recommendations for treating child & adolescent obesity state that programs
      should have ≥ 25 hr of comprehensive treatment including dietary, physical activity and
      behavioral counseling, and that programs with < 25 hr usually do not produce improvements.
      The implication is that, if centers cannot provide this level of service (as most cannot),
      it is not worth providing any kind of treatment at all. In extreme exception to this, an
      intensive 3-hr non-restrictive obesity prevention program involving participant-driven
      healthy lifestyle improvement plans designed to bring caloric intake and output into balance
      (Healthy Weight) has been found to significantly reduce increases in BMI and obesity onset
      relative to alternative interventions and assessment-only controls through 3-yr follow-up.
      We propose to test an extended 6-hr version of the Healthy Weight intervention in a sample
      of primarily low SES, minority adolescents and young adults who are overweight and report
      body dissatisfaction and subthreshold eating disorder symptoms, as these are prevalent risk
      factors for obesity. We will test the hypothesis that participants assigned to the Healthy
      Weight vs. control intervention will have significantly lower BMI and % body fat during
      follow-up. Secondary outcomes will include body dissatisfaction, depressive symptoms, and
      eating disorder symptoms. 300 adolescents and young adults at high risk for future weight
      gain by virtue of their age, BMI percentile, body dissatisfaction and eating disorder
      symptomatology will be randomized to Healthy Weight or weight control educational video.
      Participants will complete assessments of BMI, body composition, potential mediators, and
      other outcomes at pretest, posttest and 6--mo follow-ups (in yr 1). Thus, to refute the
      USPSTF recommendations statement, we propose to show that a 6-hr intervention led by
      graduate students can produce significant reductions in risk for both obesity and eating
      disorders, suggesting this inexpensive and brief intervention could and should be rolled out
      nationwide.

      Primary Aim: To test the hypothesis that Healthy Weight will significantly reduce increases
      in BMI, % body fat, and risk for onset of obesity during follow-up.

      Secondary Aim: To test the hypothesis that Healthy Weight will significantly reduce body
      dissatisfaction, depressive symptoms, and eating disorder symptoms.

      The purpose of this study is to combine a culturally tailored and integrated Risk Reduction
      Intervention in the US Virgin Islands (USVI) in a clinical trial randomly assigning abused
      women to a 1) Healthy Relationships experimental group of three sessions of risk reduction
      interventions or 2) a Healthy Living comparison control group of three session of health
      promotion activities to determine if the combined, intervention is safe and effective in a
      test the following hypotheses:

        1. Women in the integrated risk reduction intervention will score significantly lower on
           outcome measures of intimate partner abuse (IPA) and STD/HIV risk behaviors end of
           Session III and at 3 and 6 months than women in the control group

        2. Women in the integrated risk reduction Intervention will score significantly higher on
           IPA safety behaviors and STI/HIV prevention behaviors at end of Session III and at 3
           and 6 months than women in the control group.

      Several exploratory and major controlled studies on the mainland US have shown intimate
      partner violence (IPV) and intimate partner abuse (IPA) to be risk factors for a variety of
      physical, reproductive and mental health problems, including sexually transmitted infections
      and HIV/AIDS, many of which are areas of known health disparity for African American and
      Latina women. A recently completed study of African Caribbean and African American women in
      the US Virgin Islands revealed that nearly one third of women reported lifetime partner
      abuse and increased risk for sexually transmitted infections including HIV/AIDS. Abused
      women in the USVI had significantly more risk factors for HIV/AIDS than did women who were
      not abused.

      The proposed intervention combines an empowerment model designed to help abused women make
      choices that protect the physical and emotional health of the woman and her family with a
      sexual safety model designed to help her make choices to reduce her risk of acquiring an STI
      or contracting HIV/AIDS. The integrated model adapts two interventions that have been tested
      with African American women on the US mainland and found to be effective as separate
      interventions for IPV and IPA and reducing the risk of STI/HIV. The adapted interventions
      will be used with abused African Caribbean women based on an a priori assessment of the
      cultural attitudes, beliefs and resources available to women living in an island environment

NCT02159625,Abdominal Compression Elastic Support (ACES),"
      Hemodialysis (HD) patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) experience higher rates of
      cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality than do the general population and many
      populations with other chronic diseases. This exceptional risk is explained in part by known
      risk factors, such as diabetes, hypertension, and other uremia-related factors, including
      vascular calcification and stiffness, autonomic dysfunction, and a high burden of
      circulating inflammatory mediators. Recent studies suggest that blood pressure variability,
      especially intra-dialytic hypotension (IDH) is the most significant risk factor for these CV
      events. Studies have also shown that the use of IAB is capable of improving cardiovascular
      function for avoiding or minimizing the development of an orthostatic hypotensive episode
      (OHE) in patients with autonomic dysfunction, orthostatic hypotension (OH) in diabetes
      patients and children with orthostatic intolerance, and post-dialytic orthostatic
      hypotension (PDOH).

      The investigators propose a study to examine the use of an abdominal compression elastic
      support (ACES) to prevent the development of IDH in patients who are known to be prone to
      these episodes. The ultimate goal is to facilitate more effective and safer dialysis

      Thickening of the heart muscle (left ventricle) known medically as Left Ventricular
      Hypertrophy (LVH) is very common in patients with heart disease. This increases risk of
      cerebrovascular/cardiovascular event.

      LVH is asymptomatic and managed by the use of medication to control blood pressure, however
      LVH may be seen in normotensive patients where factors such as obesity and insulin
      resistance are present.

      Insulin resistance is a condition where although the body produces insulin it is unable to
      utilize it effectively. Metformin, a drug used to treat diabetes, can reduce insulin
      resistance and cause weight loss, it may therefore improve LVH. This study will investigate
      the ability of metformin to reduce LVH in patients with heart disease, this may be a novel
      way forward in the risk reduction of cerebrovascular/cardiovascular events. Participants
      will be identified throughout NHS Tayside, those eligible will be randomly allocated to

      Research hypothesis:

      Is the treatment with renal denervation (RDN) early post ACS safe and effective and does it
      leads to improved cardiac function and attenuation of pathologic left ventricular
      remodelling? In a following study, the hypothesis will be tested in a larger ACS population
      with major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) after ACS as the endpoint.

      Rationale for conducting this study:

      ACS i.e. ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non- ST-elevation myocardial
      infarction (non-STEMI) are the most important causes of morbidity and mortality in western
      societies. Hypertension is a major risk factor for development of ACS and heart failure but
      it also worsens the prognosis in patients after ACS. Our research highlights the combination
      therapy of PCI and RDN in an ACS patient population with simultaneous hypertension.

      Primary objective:

      The primary objective of this study is to establish safety and efficacy of combined
      treatment with PCI and renal denervation (RDN) in hypertensive patients with acute coronary
      syndromes (STEMI and non-STEMI ) having ventricular mass after 4 months as the primary

NCT02381340,ACE Stapler Sub Study,"
      Obesity and its associated conditions have reached epidemic proportions. Estimates are that
      about one third of the adults in the United States have obesity. At this moment there are
      many therapeutic approaches for the treatment of obesity. But, efficacy of most treatment
      options are limited and so far surgical intervention has been proven to be the only strategy
      to overcome severe obesity. However, bariatric surgery has limitations and risks, which
      might be minimized by non-incisional endoscopic procedures.

      BaroSense developed a new device, called the Articulating Circular Endoscopic (ACETM)
      Stapler, which can be used in the treatment of obesity. It is a trans-oral procedure, which
      intends to reduce the ability of the stomach to expand by creating plications in the region
      of the fundus and greater curvature. In contrast with other bariatric surgery it is
      endoscopically performed, reversible and if it fails most future surgical options are still
      open.

      The main study ('Open, prospective study to evaluate the safety and preliminary
      effectiveness of the BaroSense ACE™ Stapler for the treatment of obesity', multicenter study
      (MUMC+, AMC and St. Antonius), accepted by MEC AMC) seeks to determine the safety and
      efficacy of this plicating system for patients with severe obesity.

      In this sub-study we want to unravel the exact mechanism and provide more information about
      the efficacy of the BaroSense ACE™ Stapler. Therefore we will measure changes in various
      parameters that are known to affect weight loss and metabolism, before and after gastric

NCT02390323,Changes in Skin Conductance Measurement as an Endpoint Monitor for Sympathetic Blocks,"
      This study is intended to evaluate a monitor that will facilitate ascertainment of an
      effective sympathetic blockade following Lumbar Sympathetic blocks. Utilization of a monitor
      with a rapid response and easy clinical applicability which can demonstrate effective
      sympathetic block would increase efficiency within the procedure suite and also serve to
      function as an objective endpoint for the evaluation of sympathetic blockade in future
      research.In current clinical practice, the most commonly used monitoring methods are
      clinical observations of sympathetic blockade, skin temperature monitoring, pulse pressure
      monitoring and any combination of these monitoring methods. The skin temperature and pulse
      pressure may increase after sympathetic block. However, changes in the skin temperature and
      pulse pressure often demonstrate an unpredictable or delayed response. Confounding
      variables, such as ambient temperature, coexisting vascular disease, use of other vasoactive
      medications may contribute to inconsistencies in the temperature or pulse pressure
      responses.

      Normal sympathetic activity stimulates muscarinic receptors in the periphery that
      subsequently stimulate the sweat glands to secrete and fill with sweat containing sodium and
      other electrolytes. The electrolytes present in the sweat increase the electrical
      conductance while decreasing the electrical resistance at the skin level.

      The real-time changes in skin conductance indices can be monitored at the skin level, by use
      of non-invasive electrodes attached to the skin (similar to EKG electrodes). A computer
      program analyzes the data and produces a real-time graphic and numeric data demonstrating
      the skin conductance response. The initiation of successful sympathetic blockade can cause
      rapid cessation of the skin sympathetic activity that leads to a decrease in skin
      conductance within seconds.

      Pain has been defined as a subjective experience. Various pain assessment tools, (such as
      NRS) have been developed and validated to objectively monitor and treat pain. There are
      certain patient populations, in whom, the current pain assessment tools cannot be used
      effectively due to communication problems such as cognitively impaired patients. In the US,
      the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) has made it
      mandatory to monitor and treat pain. In the absence of reliable pain assessment tools that
      would objectively measure pain, there is also risk of under treatment and overtreatment of
      pain that may lead to negative outcomes. Therefore, a monitor that is able to predict pain
      levels objectively, will help to achieve above goals. The investigators are using Skin

      This the first report undertaken to assess the effect of supplementation with oral
      gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), adenosine and antrosterol-containing AC mycelia on blood
      pressure among people with mild hypertension. Overall, AC mycelia consumption for 8 weeks
      could successfully reduce mean diastolic and systolic BP through the suppression of PRA that
      is linked to downstream suppresion of angiotensin II formation, which further decreases the
      sympathetic outflow that leads to hypertension. In addition to blood pressure lowering
      properties, AC mycelia also has beneficial effect in reducing oxidative stress,
      significantly. No adverse events were noted, suggesting that AC mycelia deserve its
      consideration as a candidate for safe alternative treatment to conventional

NCT00497094,Stenting Versus Best Medical Treatment of Asymptomatic High Grade Carotid Artery Stenosis,"
      Background. Carotid artery stenting (CAS) recently has become an accepted method for
      treatment of patients with high-grade carotid artery stenosis, who are at an increased risk
      for surgical carotid endarterectomy (CEA). The reported rates of neurological complications
      of CAS substantially decreased during the past years, and the routine use of cerebral
      protection devices and low profile catheter systems have further increased the procedure´s
      safety. In the early 90's large surgical trials in North America and Europe (NASCET, ECST
      and ACAS) demonstrated superiority of CEA compared to best medical treatment for symptomatic
      and asymptomatic patients. Provided that the ongoing randomized controlled trials comparing
      CAS and CEA confirm equivalence between the these methods, CAS similar to CEA is applicable
      to symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with high grade carotid stenosis. However,
      particularly in asymptomatic patients, the indication for revascularisation remains
      debatable. Protected CAS is associated with a very low rate of neurological complications,
      which are below the AHA recommendation for treating asymptomatic patients (3%). However, the
      introduction of new vascular protective medications like statins and clopidogrel during the
      recent years substantially improved the spectrum of best medical treatment, and the findings
      of NASCET, ECST and ACAS with respect to best medical treatment may therefore not be
      applicable any more.

      Study hypothesis and aims. Given the low frequency of spontaneous neurological
      complications, the preferable therapeutic approach to patients with asymptomatic high grade
      ( > 80%) carotid artery stenoses is currently unknown. Modern best medical treatment may
      manage to stabilize the atherosclerotic plaque, while CAS has the potential of resolving the
      carotid stenosis. Comparative data, however, are not available as yet. We hypothesized that
      protected CAS has a beneficial effect on occurrence of ipsilateral neurological
      complications and major adverse cardiac events in high-risk patients with asymptomatic > 80%
      internal carotid artery stenosis. Therefore, the aim of the present randomized controlled
      trial was to analyze neurological and cardiovascular outcome of patients treated with
      elective CAS plus best medical treatment compared to best medical treatment only.

NCT00633503,Monitoring of Tissue Transfer Flaps by Modulated Imaging (MI) Spectroscopy,"
      Tissue transfer flaps are a method of moving tissue from a donor location to a recipient
      location. In the case of a free tissue transfer flaps, the blood vessels to the transferred
      tissues are detached and then re-attached to different arteries & veins at the recipient
      site. The process of reconstructive surgery using tissue transfer flaps allows for improved
      results in terms of functionality, aesthetic appearance, and psychological well-being in
      patients requiring reconstructive surgery after cancer resection or trauma. The process of
      reconstructive surgery using tissue transfer flaps is not without complications. These
      complications may include acute arterial or venous occlusion, as well as the development of
      late complications such as fat necrosis and flap atrophy.

      The purpose of this pilot study is to determine if a novel, unique, portable, non-contact
      optical imaging device developed at the Beckman Laser Institute called Modulated Imaging
      (MI) can detect changes in a flap's optical properties, which can correlate with arterial or
      venous occlusion or with the development of fat necrosis or flap atrophy. The study would
      also evaluate if changes in the tissue transfer flap's optical properties, as detected by
      the device could be employed as a monitoring device in the post-operative period after
      reconstructive surgery. The MI device's detection of specific optical properties of a tissue
      flap could also potentially be used as a diagnostic tool to predict the likelihood of the
      development of fat necrosis or flap atrophy in a delayed fashion several months after
      reconstructive surgery.

      Prior animal and clinical studies using similar devices have demonstrated that changes in
      the total hemoglobin concentration and percentage of oxygenated hemoglobin in the tissue
      transfer flap can be used to differentiate between arterial and venous occlusion. These
      other similar devices have been shown to be able to detect venous occlusion prior to
      clinical manifestations of venous occlusion using standard monitoring methods. This early
      detection of venous occlusion has important implications. It is well established that early
      detection and surgical re-exploration and correction of venous occlusion is associated with
      improved survival and salvage rates of tissue transfer flaps. It has been suggested in the
      reconstructive literature that the development of fat necrosis and flap atrophy are caused
      by a relative arterial or venous insufficiency, which could be detected using the MI device
      prior to the clinical manifestations of these complications.Patients undergoing
      reconstructive surgery at UCI Medical Center will be recruited for enrollment into the
      study. The study design requires following the patients and review their medical records in
      order to determine the clinical outcomes of their reconstructive surgery. The process of
      review of the medical record will require the review of both the in-patient medical record
      during the hospitalization in which the reconstructive surgery takes place and the
      outpatient medical record after surgery in order to observe for the possible development of
      the acute and delayed complications of reconstructive surgery.

        -  Three factors combine to promote tissue necrosis in diabetic feet: ischemia, neuropathy
           and trauma. Among them, ischemia peripheral arterial disease may play the important
           roles in the development of DFU. Moreover, diffuse vascular disease is the main

NCT01691911,Preconditioning Shields Against Vascular Events in Surgery,"
      Major vascular surgery involves operations to repair swollen blood vessels, clear debris
      from blocked arteries or bypass blocked blood vessels. Patients with these problems are a
      high-risk surgical group as they have generalized blood vessel disease. These puts them at
      risk of major complications around the time of surgery such as heart attacks , strokes and
      death. The mortality following repair of a swollen main artery in the abdomen is about 1 in
      20. This contrasts poorly with the 1 per 100 risk of death following a heart bypass. Simple
      and cost-effective methods are needed to reduce the risks of major vascular surgery. Remote
      ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) may be such a technique. To induce RIPC, the blood supply
      to muscle in the patient's arm is interrupted for about 5 minutes. It is then restored for a
      further five minutes. This cycle is repeated three more times. The blood supply is
      interrupted simply by inflating a blood pressure cuff to maximum pressure. This repeated
      brief interruption of the muscular blood supply sends signals to critical organs such as the
      brain and heart, which are rendered temporarily resistant to damage from reduced blood
      supply. Several small randomized clinical trials in patients undergoing different types of
      major vascular surgery have demonstrated a potential benefit. This large, multi-centre trial
      aims to determine whether RIPC can reduce complications in routine practice.

NCT01745692,Pragmatic Ischaemic Stroke Thrombectomy Evaluation,"
      Ischaemic strokes (those caused by blockage in an artery in the brain caused by a blood
      clot) can be treated with very early use of clot-busting (thrombolytic) drugs to attempt to
      restore the blood supply and limit the damage, resulting in an increased proportion of
      people making a recovery to independence after stroke. However, drug treatment only succeed
      in restoring blood flow in a minority of people with clots in the larger arteries (10-25%
      depending on the size of the blood vessel) and these people also have the most severe
      strokes and highest risk of death or dependence as a result of the stroke. Current best
      treatment is therefore least effective in the group with the most severe strokes. Devices
      that can be fed through the blood vessels to either remove or break up the blood clot in the
      brain vessels can open this type of large artery blockage. However, using these devices is a
      highly skilled procedure and it takes some time both to set up the necessary facilities
      (including anaesthetic, nurses and medical support) and to reach the blockage. The extra
      time that is required to use these devices may mean that brain tissue is already
      irreversibly damaged. If so, then an individual patient cannot benefit and indeed may be
      harmed by opening the artery. There are no completed clinical trials comparing the outcome
      in people treated with standard stroke treatment and those treated with devices. PISTE is a
      randomised, controlled trial to test whether additional mechanical thrombectomy device
      treatment improves functional outcome in patients with large artery occlusion who are given
      IV thrombolytic drug treatment as standard care.

NCT02163031,Left vs. Right Radial Approach for Routine Catheterization of Heart Transplant Patients,"
      Orthotopic heart transplantation is a well established therapeutic measure for end stage
      heart failure, leading to significant improvements in survival and quality of life. In the
      routine clinical practice, orthotopic heart transplantation patients receive periodic
      cardiac catheterization for early detection of allograft vascular disease.

      The coronary angiography of these patients is characterized for several technical
      difficulties, generally related to the presence of the aortotomy with anomalous implantation
      of the coronary ostia and to the orthotopic position of the allograft. For these reasons,
      trans femoral approach is usually preferred. In the last two decades, trans radial approach
      for coronary angiography emerged to be effective, safe and able to improve patient comfort.
      However, there is no universal consensus on the optimal choice of radial access from either
      the left or the right artery. Currently, this choice is largely dependent on the operator's
      preference. The trans right radial approach is generally preferred in routine clinical
      practice mainly due to its easier catheter manipulation for the operators from patient's
      right side, and the current design of radial compression devices for the right wrist in
      medical market. As such, a major barrier to prevent the wide adoption of the left radial
      access lies in some difficulty to reach the left wrist leaning over the patient,
      particularly for shorter operators or in obese patients. However, a great deal of attention
      has been recently directed toward the trans left radial access, as it has an important
      anatomical advantage due to the vascular anatomy of epiaortic vessels with a straighter
      route to the left coronary ostium, which could also reduce the risk of cerebrovascular
      complications.

      However, no data are available about the performance of trans left radial or trans-right
      radial approach in coronary angiography orthotopic heart transplantation patients. However,
      in this particular setting of patients, the left radial approach might reduce the technical
      difficulties related to the anatomical variations.

      In this single centre, prospective, randomized study, we sought to compare trans right
      radial versus trans left radial approach in terms of amount of contrast medium, radiation
      exposure, number of catheters used, cross over to the other access site rate and local and
      systemic complications in orthotopic heart transplantation patients.

        3. Evaluate and compare the rate of complications of both techniques.

        4. Assess the quality of life of patients before and after treatment.

      MATERIAL AND METHODS

      The trial was subjected to evaluation and accepted by the Ethics Committee of the Fundació
      Unió Catalana d'Hospitals (Catalonian Union of Hospitals Foundation).

      All patients with grade III and IV hemorrhoids that are eligible for surgical treatment with
      both methods who agree to participate in the study, will be included in the prospective
      randomized trial. All patients will be required to sign the specific informed consent.

      Patients who are suitable for treatment with both techniques will be randomly assigned to
      the surgical technique.

      Inclusion criteria:

      1. Patients with symptomatic grade III or IV hemorrhoids (bleeding, pain, itching, soiling
      or prolapse) that are eligible for surgical treatment with both methods.

      Exclusion criteria:

        1. Associated recto-anal pathology such as acute thrombosed hemorrhoid, anal fissure,
           perianal fistula, perianal abscess, rectal prolapse, fecal incontinence or anal
           stenosis.

        2. Prior anorectal surgery .

        3. Systemic pathology that could alter the outcome of the surgery as coagulopathies,
           chronic pain with continued consumption of analgesics.

        4. Age younger than 18 or older than 80 years, socio-pathology or inability to understand
           the study objectives.

      All surgeries are performed on an outpatient basis under regional anesthesia and sedation
      for the same team of three surgeons. Preoperative preparation consists of a cleansing enema
      and no prophylactic antibiotics will be administered.

      Both techniques will be performed in ""Jack -Knife"" position. The open hemorrhoidectomy may
      include one to three anal cushions and made according to the Milligan-Morgan technique, with
      resection of the anal cushion and the external hemorrhoidal epidermal component using
      electrocautery and ligation of the hemorroidal base with absorbable suture. Once completed
      hemorrhoidectomy a perianal block is performed with bupivacaine/epinephrine.

      Hemorrhoidal artery ligation and rectoanal repair will be performed with the AMI minimally
      invasive surgery device HAL/RAR, and consist in the ligation of the terminal branches of the
      superior rectal artery with 2-0 absorbable polyglycolic acid suture after identifying the
      blood flow approximately 3 cm above the dentate line by using Doppler guidance.
      Subsequently, a running suture was added from the suture point to 5 mm above the dentate
      line to lift the prolapsing hemorroid. Other procedures will not be associated, if
      necessary, the patient will be excluded from the study .

      The patient will be discharged if adequate pain control, oral tolerance and spontaneous
      diuresis is achieved, and after examination by the surgeon in order to discard immediate
      complications. The ambulatory treatment consists of an osmotic laxative (magnesium hydroxide
      ), oral analgesia with paracetamol/tramadol ( 325mg/37.5mg ) every 6 hours and Dexketoprofen
      (25 mg) every 8 hours, metamizol (575 mg) may be associated every 8 hours if pain. In case
      of persistent pain, the patient will be examinated in emergency room.

      EVALUATION OF RESULTS A power analysis was performed to assess the study sample size.
      Choosing a power of 0.8 and a confidence interval of 95% α-error of 0.05, we calculated that
      26 patients were needed in each arm. We increased this number up to 30 to increase
      reliability of the study.

      All patients will be evaluated with a validated questionnaire of 36 questions on quality of
      life ( SF-36 ) and specific questions about specific symptoms of hemorrhoidal disease (pain,
      itching , bleeding, soiling and hemorrhoidal prolapse reduction ). The questionnaire will be
      answered before the intervention, after six and twelve months of follow up.

      All patients will complete a diary testing global postoperative pain every day, measured on
      a numerical scale from 0 to 10 during the first 15 days.

      The patients will be assessed on the day of discharge and at 7, 14, and 30 postoperative

      Background: Radiofrequency ablation of typical atrial flutter present the most effective
      treament option in treatment of atrial flutter. Despite its high efficacy, due tovariant
      anatomy of cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI), i.e. location of right coronary artery, pouches, the
      achievment of complete bidirectional block across the CTI is sometimes chalenging.
      Intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) is a very usefull tool for on-line vizualization of the
      anatomy of the atria and also for the location of catheter position on CTI during ablation.
      If the routine use of ICE is associated with easier atrial fluter ablation is not clear.

      Methods: One hundred consecutive patients indicated for typical atrial flutter ablation will
      be enrolled into the study. The patients will be randomized into group (A) ablation with use
      of ICE and (B) ablation without ICE. The ablation will be done in both groups by two
      diagnostic catheters (10-pole positioned in coronary sinus and 20-pole halo catheter
      positioned in the right atrium) and radiofrequency ablation catheter. The end-point of the
      ablation is the achievment of the bicidrectional block across the CTI. The end-points of the
      study are 1) the total length of the procedure, 2) the fluoroscopy time and 3) the ablation
      time. The safety end-point is clinically significant bleeding from the groin due to
      additional puncture for ICE catheter.

      Discussion: We hypothesize the use of ICE wil shorten the radiofrequency energy delivery,
      fluoroscopy time and the length of the procedure without increasing the bleeding.

NCT02453321,Continuous Adductor Canal Blocks Vs. Low Dose Femoral Nerve Blocks For Early Rehabilitation After Knee Arthroplasty,"
      Recently, several articles have suggested or reported that Adductor Canal Blocks (ACBs)
      offer adequate or equal analgesia and may promote better performance in early rehabilitation
      following Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) when compared to the more commonly used Femoral
      Nerve Block (FNB). A common feature of these studies has been the use of moderate to high
      concentration local anesthetics (e.g. 0.2% or 0.5% Ropivacaine respectively) which when
      injected by a large motor nerve will inevitably cause weakness. However, the practice at our
      institution has long been a continuous femoral nerve block (CFNB) with a lower concentration
      local anesthetic (0.0625% Bupivacaine). Over the past several years the investigators have
      performed several thousand CFNBs using this technique which has offered the advantage of
      minimal motor weakness and adequate analgesia.

      The primary goal of this study is to determine if our established practice of using a low
      concentration continuous FNB inserted about 5cm caudal to the groin crease (the apex of the
      femoral triangle) using a low infusion rate of 2ml/hr is comparable to the emerging practice
      of inserting a Continuous Peripheral Nerve Block (CPNB) in the anatomic adductor canal (AC)
      - infusing at 4ml/hr. A secondary goal is to study the effect of cumulative volume of local
      anesthetic infused through a FNB when at a rate of 2ml/hr compared to a rate of 4ml/hr in
      the 48-hour postoperative period.

      Definitions of the location of the adductor canal are debated heavily in literature, but
      they seem to agree that the middle 1/3 of the thigh contains the proximal AC while the
      distal 1/3 of the thigh contains the adductor hiatus - the terminal end of the AC. Our study
      will require placement of the continuous ACB no more distal than 20cm cephalad to the
      superior pole of the patella due to placement prior to surgery and the need to keep the
      dressing out of the operative field. The CACB catheter will also not be placed any more
      proximal than 20cm distal to the ASIS. In addition to other exclusion criteria, these
      measurements will create an exclusion for patients with an iliac-to-patella distance less
      than 40cm. Iliac to Patella distance (IPD) will be measured at the pre-operative interview
      on the day of surgery with a measuring tape. External palpable landmarks of the Anterior
      superior iliac spine and the superior pole of the patella will be used.

      The primary outcome is based upon the ability to perform rehabilitation exercises
      postoperatively to the extent that criteria for discharge can be met. The primary outcome
      measured is the time at which a patient gains the ability to successfully perform a 75-feet
      unassisted walk. On the Day of Surgery (DOS), prior to any walking attempt, a secondary
      outcome measure will be to perform a 5-second sustained straight leg raise. Other secondary
      outcomes will be the number of days admitted prior to discharge, and average pain scores on
      DOS, POD#1, and POD#2. The Day of discharge will also be used as a secondary outcome.
      Earlier discharge is becoming a goal of almost all healthcare systems to minimize costs.

      A well-functioning vascular access is essential for effective hemodialysis. The native
      arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is the preferred vascular access because of the lower thrombosis
      and infection risks compared to either synthetic arteriovenous grafts or central venous
      catheters. Brachiocephalic arteriovenous fistula (BCAVF) and transposed brachiobasilic
      arteriovenous fistula (T-BBAVF) are recommended when there is either a primary failure or no
      suitable vessels for the forearm fistula. However, BCAVF is frequently cannulated at the
      antecubital fossa, the risks of stenosis and thrombosis are high, which will compromise
      proper BCAVF function and survival. T-BBAVF is not only technically challenging, but also
      associates with severe arm swelling and pain. Thus, the investigators introduced a novel
      modified Non-transposed brachiobasilic arteriovenous fistula (mNT-BBAVF) for long-term
      hemodialysis patients. To confirm its efficacy, a prospective clinical study would be

      available advanced specific drug therapy. Pulmonary hypertension advanced therapy is also
      expensive and leads to frequent adverse effects, sometimes serious. Results from a pilot
      study, the first-in-man experience of pulmonary artery denervation, demonstrated a clinical
      improvement in 13 patients with severe pulmonary hypertension despite optimal medical
      management. However this single non-randomized study requires confirmation.

      The investigators propose a prospective multi-center, randomized, single-blinded trial. Its
      main objective will be to assess, in patients with uncontrolled pulmonary hypertension
      despite optimal medical management, the efficacy of pulmonary artery denervation in reducing
      mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) at six months, compared to continued medical treatment
      following a simulated (sham) procedure.

      The principal evaluation criteria will be the mPAP change (in mm Hg) as measured by right
      heart catheterization.

      The study will run for 18 months and it will be necessary to recruit 50 patients.

      All adult patients (with the exception of pregnant women and individuals unable to receive
      an appropriate information and to give their free and informed consent) with uncontrolled
      pulmonary arterial hypertension despite optimal medical management will be invited to
      participate, in the absence of any exclusion criteria.

      The investigators will also measure changes in clinical, biological, echocardiographic and
      hemodynamic prognostic markers in both groups.

NCT00760903,Magnetic Resonance (MR) Spectroscopy and Diffusion Tensor Imaging in Determining Brain Injury and Subsequent Clinical Outcome in Patients of Moderate Brain Trauma,"
      The purpose of this study is to use magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and diffusion
      tensor imaging (DTI) to assess for traumatic brain injury and determine if there is any
      correlation of these findings to clinical outcome. MR spectroscopy using 2D-CSI (a multi
      voxel technique) of the corpus callosum, basal ganglia, lobar white matter and brainstem may
      reveal areas of injury and quantification of the metabolites from these areas may be used to
      correlate with imaging findings and clinical evaluation. White matter disruption in these
      areas is commonly seen after TBI, caused by diffuse axonal injury. It has been implicated in
      the long term outcomes in these patients, but has been difficult to assess by standard
      radiologic studies.

      By the use of DTI it may be possible to demonstrate damaged white matter tracts which could
      be helpful in the evaluation of traumatic brain injury. Most TBI subjects have injuries that
      involved torque to the brain. This results in a shearing injury to the long white matter
      tracts, which has been hypothesized to be related to cognitive outcome.

      Also, to demonstrate that MRS and DTI prove valuable in predicting outcome in patients of
      moderate brain trauma by conducting progressive studies acutely (within 24 hours) and long
      term (4-6 weeks). Most patients will most likely be followed clinically for over a year,
      and, if clinical indicated, farther scanning can be done at a later date.

      By comparing fraction anisotropy, ADC values, and metabolic ratios by the use of DTI and MRS
      in the adult and pediatric populations, may help to assess differences in recovery.

      Lastly, a comparison between the two groups in changes in brain metabolism and/or white
      matter tract disruption/re-connection after TBI with and/or without links to outcome can be
      done.

NCT01200628,DEPITAC : Short Screening Scale for Psychotraumatic Disorders After Motor Vehicle Accident,"
      Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a serious and often chronic response to
      overwhelmingly stressful events as Road Traffic Accident. Moreover PTSD is associated with
      increased rates of medical morbidity, poor health-related quality of life, and functional
      impairment. PTSD is prevalent in primary care settings after road traffic accident, where
      approximately 25% of patients meet diagnostic criteria for the disorder. Despite the
      development of a number of efficacious behavioral and pharmacological treatments, only a
      minority of patients with PTSD receive mental health services. PTSD is frequently
      underrecognized and untreated in Emergency Department and Surgical Unit.

      Then, early diagnosis and prevention of PTSD might help to identify patients with PTSD high
      risk and lead them to benefit of personalized cares. Nevertheless it is not possible
      (neither useful) to provide psychological cares for each road traffic accident victim.

      This is the reason why we think that nurses can help to screen patients who need treatment
      for PTSD Hypothesis : Recognition of specific clinical or biological signs occurring during
      road traffic accident victim hospitalization in surgical unit could allow beginning specific
      treatment using consultation liaison psychiatry.

      Early treatment could allow decreasing incidence of psychotraumatic disorders, increasing
      surgical functional efficacy and improve convalescence programs. The use of a specific
      questionnaire could help to screen this disorder.

      We have created the DEPITAC scale : a short screening questionnaire with 10 items.

      25%-50% of patients treated with several commonly used anti-cancer drugs including
      capecitabine and sunitinib. These drugs are known to improve survival in many cancers,
      including cancers of the colon, stomach, liver, breast, kidney, and GI stromal tumors
      (GIST). Worldwide, over 400,000 patients per year are treated with one of these agents. HFS
      involves skin changes, such as swelling, peeling, and blistering of the palms and soles,
      which is often painful and debilitating. As a result, HFS-related symptoms can frequently
      lead to dose reduction and/or discontinuation of otherwise effective anti-cancer treatment.
      There is no treatment for HFS other than dose reduction or stopping treatment. This proposal

      Background:

        -  The brain has natural electrical rhythms of brain activities. These rhythms may be
           different in people with movement disorders, such as dystonia (involuntary muscle
           movement, cramps, or tremors). Understanding these rhythms may provide more information
           about movement disorders.

        -  Focal hand dystonia, also known as ""writer's cramp"" or ""musician's cramp,"" is a painful
           condition that affects the hand and arm muscles. Researchers want to use transcranial
           magnetic stimulation (TMS) to study brain rhythms in people with and without focal hand
           dystonia.

      Objectives:

      - To better understand brain rhythms involved in focal hand dystonia.

      Eligibility:

        -  Individuals between 18 and 70 years of age who are right-handed and have focal hand
           dystonia.

        -  Healthy right-handed volunteers between 18 and 60 years of age.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history.

        -  This study includes two tests: a pilot test and a main test. The pilot test will
           determine the frequency of TMS that will be used in the main test. Participants may be
           in one or both tests. Each test requires a single outpatient visit that will last up to
           5 hours.

        -  Participants will have a base test to see how their muscles respond to TMS. This will
           look at the electrical activity of the muscles. Participants will have a wire coil held
           on their scalp. A brief electrical current will pass through the coil. It creates a
           magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. Researchers will test the TMS on the right
           and left sides of the head. This will help find the spot that activates the finger
           muscles, and see how much TMS is needed.

        -  In the main test, participants will have repetitive TMS (rTMS). rTMS involves repeated
           magnetic pulses delivered in short bursts. There will be four pulses in each burst.
           Participants will have multiple bursts during the test. This test will look at how the
           muscles of the hand and fingers respond to brain stimulation.

      New high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) assays allow earlier detection of acute
      myocardial infarction (AMI). Furthermore, elevated values were associated with an increased

NCT02177188,HEAVy HAT-HEAlthy Volunteers Heart to Arm Time. Haemorrhage Simulation Protocol in Healthy Volunteers,"
      In prehospital settings, hypovolemic shock diagnosis is based on Advanced Trauma Life
      Support (ATLS) shock classification. The most often used clinical signs are heart rate (HR),
      arterial blood pressure (BP), respiratory rate, neurologic status, diuresis, skin colour and
      temperature. However, some of these signs, such as hypotension and tachycardia, lack
      specificity and sensitivity and do not occur early enough. Even with an early preload
      reduction, blood pressure can remain constant due to compensatory mechanisms, such as
      vasoconstriction and positive chronotropism. Tachycardia occurs earlier, but has poor
      specificity and sensitivity. A retrospective analysis of 25,287 trauma patients showed that
      among 489 patients presenting with systolic BP < 90 mmHg, only 65% had tachycardia (HR > 90
      bpm), while 39% of patients with systolic BP > 120 mmHg were tachycardic, probably resulting
      from other stimuli influencing heart rate, such as pain, fear, circulating hormones and
      endogenous enkephalins. Therefore, it could be very useful to have an index that identifies
      initial volume variation, when physiological regulatory mechanisms are still effectively
      maintaining normal BP.

      Pulse transit time (PTT) is the sum of pre-ejection period (PEP; the time interval between
      the onset of ventricular depolarization and ventricular ejection) and vascular transit time
      (VTT; the time it takes for the pulse wave to travel from the aortic valve to peripheral
      arteries). PEP and VTT variations depend on preload variation, and PTT increases with PEP,
      showing a linear correlation (R2 = 0.96). Chan et al. subjected 11 healthy volunteers to the
      head-up tilt test, and demonstrated that PEP increased and VTT decreased for increasing tilt
      angles from 0° to 80°, corresponding to light-moderate bleeding. They also observed early
      sympathetic activation, expressed by decreases of both RR interval (RR) and VTT, dampening
      the PTT increase, since PTT is influenced by both continuous PEP increase and progressive
      VTT decrease occurring during hypovolaemia.

      Here the investigators describe a new index, called indexed Heart to Arm Time (iHAT). iHAT
      is the mPTT/RR ratio, where mPTT is a modified PTT, measured from the onset of ventricular
      depolarization (the 'R' wave of the ECG trace) to the systolic peak of the
      photoplethysmographic pulse oxymetry (PPG) waveform. mPTT is indexed to RR interval on ECG
      to counteract sympathetic activation that would dampen PEP increase and enhance VTT
      reduction, by means of positive inotropism and peripheral vasoconstriction, respectively.
      iHAT therefore increases during haemorrhage because of preload reduction and the consequent
      PEP increase and RR interval decrease. iHAT is expressed as the time percentage of the
      interbeat interval (RR) it takes to the PPG waveform to travel to peripheral arteries. In
      this study iHAT has been calculated as the average of beat-to-beat mPTT/RR ratios over 30
      heart beats (corresponding to at least 2 breathing cycles) in order to minimize the effect
      of spontaneous breathing on preload, and thus on PEP and PTT.

      In the present study, the investigators aimed to evaluate iHAT in a simulating model of
      hypovolaemia by using a Lower Body Negative Pressure (LBNP) chamber. LBNP chamber simulates
      haemorrhage by applying negative pressure to the lower limbs, thus giving an accurate model
      of hypovolemia. The LBNP chamber has been used for many years for research purposes, and in
      2001 Convertino suggested it is a useful device to test severe haemorrhage-related
      hemodynamic responses. In fact, the induced volemic sequestration is an efficient technique
      to study physiological behaviours in humans.

      The primary endpoint was to evaluate the use of the iHAT as a predictor of hypovolaemia. The
      secondary endpoint was to compare the specificity and sensitivity of the iHAT index compared
      to commonly used indexes (BP, HR). Furthermore, the investigators aimed to assess
      feasibility of Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) evaluation of Cardiac Output (CO) in a
      haemorrhagic model and to evaluate CO changes with respect to measured hemodynamic
      variables.

      TTE evaluation of CO is non invasive and comparable to thermodilution, and of possible use
      in an emergency setting.

NCT02302534,Pilot Study of Functional and Morphometric Brain Abnormalities Related to Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (MOR-FO-SIA),"
      Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a complex deformity with different curves. These
      different curves may be distinguished by different physiopathologic mechanisms.

      Without fully convincing model of the emergence and development of AIS, their multifactorial
      nature seems evident. Several pathophysiological theories involving the central nervous
      system have been proposed: the AIS would be associated with disturbances of proprioceptive
      or sensory perception, and/or with integration of this information. This would result in an
      abnormal body image, responsible for sensorimotor asymmetry that may promote or cause the
      deformation.

      The Main aim of this study is to find cortical and subcortical morphometric differences in
      the most common population of AIS (right thoracic AIS) compared to healthy adolescent
      control girls.

      Secondary Objectives are to study the cerebral white matter of the same groups (fractional
      anisotropy in the main white matter tracts), and activation of sensorimotor neural networks
      (fMRI activation and functional brain connectivity).

      Abnormalities of the studied parameters may be used as biomarkers for AIS diagnosis and

      Changes in SDB will be compared between subjects randomized to weight loss (Lifestyle

      the degree of improvement is not correlated with the amount of weight loss. This study will
      assess SDB before treatment and at 1 and 2 years. We will also investigate clinical measures
      of fat distribution that may mediate the non-linear relationship between weight loss and

NCT00261898,Chronic Sleep Deprivation as a Risk Factor for Metabolic Syndrome and Obesity,"
      OBJECTIVE: Obesity and chronic sleep deprivation have both become increasingly pervasive
      medical problems in recent years. The prevalence of adult obesity has doubled over the past
      30 years and continues to increase. In addition, industrial societies attach an economic
      value to maximizing the waking period to the longest tolerable limit by sleeping as little
      as possible. Average sleep time has decreased over the last century by 2 hours. Chronically
      sleeping less has been associated with increased weight, endocrine and metabolic health
      risks including glucose intolerance, cardiovascular disease, and mortality. The possibility
      that the current epidemic of obesity and metabolic health risks may be partially related to
      insufficient sleep is now being recognized. The objective of this proof-of-concept
      controlled trial is to investigate the impact of increasing sleep time in chronically
      sleep-deprived, obese subjects.

      STUDY POPULATION: 18-50 year old, obese (BMI 30-50) men and premenopausal women, chronically
      sleep deprived, recruited from the Baltimore-Washington metropolitan area. Chronic sleep
      deprivation will be verified by the use of sleep logs and the use of actigraphy before entry
      into the study. Secondary causes of sleep deprivation such as insomnia, psychological
      (depression), and medical conditions associated with poor sleep quality (including
      obstructive sleep apnea) will be exclusionary criteria.

      DESIGN: This is a randomized, 12-month duration, comparison-controlled clinical trial of an
      extension of sleep up to approximately 7 hours and 30 minutes (Intervention Group) or
      continuation of habitual short sleep schedule (Comparison Group). The proposed treatment is
      an educational and behavioral intervention aimed at increasing sleep in a
      non-pharmacological fashion. The main analysis of the study will be to determine if
      additional sleep will result in a significant difference in body weight at the end of 12
      months between the Intervention Group and the Comparison Group. In addition, we would like
      to establish whether 12 months of additional sleep will result in: a) a decreased prevalence
      of metabolic syndrome; and b) changes in the endocrine profile (i.e. inducing changes in
      leptin [increase] and ghrelin [decrease] opposite to the changes associated with chronic
      sleep deprivation). At the end of the 12-month intervention study (Phase 1, Efficacy
      Randomized Phase Study), all participants will be given information about the potential
      benefit of more sleep and encouraged to increase sleep time. Health teaching about proper
      nutrition and adequate exercise will also be provided at that time to the Intervention and
      Comparison Groups. All participants will be evaluated 6 months later to assess the effects
      of this intervention in a real-life situation, and offered participation in a three-year
      extension with semi-annual visits (Phase 2, Effectiveness 3 Year Follow-Up Phase Study), for
      which matched external comparison subjects will also be recruited ad hoc.

      insulin, oral glucose tolerance test, leptin, ghrelin, adiponectin, other relevant endocrine
      and anthropometric measures, body composition, various metabolic parameters, food intake,

NCT00271427,Selenium Treatment in Autoimmune Thyroiditis (AIT),"
      Selenium suppresses autoimmune destruction of thyrocytes and decreases titers of serum TPOAb
      in AIT patients. Older 4 clinical trials approved the efficacy of the daily dose of 200micg.
      It's believed that Se saturates the deficient stores of GPX so GPX saves the thyrocytes
      against to oxidative stresses. Although less than 70 micg/d is sufficient to maximize GPX
      activity, none of the authors tested the doses less than 200 micg/d. Our hypothesis was that
      If 100 micg/d can not suppress the TPOAb titers,it means autoimmune destruction can not be
      blocked by saturation of deficient stores of GPX solely and the mechanism of action requires
      more than repletion of deficient stores. It's important not only to estimate the optimal
      dose but to understand the mechanism of action. High dose therapy may also suppress TPOAb
      levels in Se-non-deficient AIT patients, if it is so, Se therapy may becomes the solely
      treatment modality which can suppress the autoimmunity in more than 400 million AIT
      patients. Because there've been no way to suppress autoimmune war and replacement of LT4 had
      been the only treatment modality for palliation. An other independent part of the study is
      to test the effect of Se in adolescent AIT patients.

NCT00646451,Pregabalin in the Treatment of Essential Tremor,"
      Pregabalin is approved for the treatment of nerve pain as well as an additional therapy in
      the treatment of seizures. In December 2004, Pfizer gained Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA) approval for use of pregabalin in nerve pain associated with diabetes and shingles;
      making it the first FDA-approved treatment for both of these nerve pain states.

      Tremor is uncontrolled trembling in part of the body. Essential tremor (ET) is associated
      with purposeful movement(e.g., holding a glass to drink, shaving, writing and buttoning a
      shirt). It occurs most often in the hands and head and also may affect the arms, voice box
      (larynx), trunk, and legs. ET is caused by abnormalities in areas of the brain that control
      movement. It usually does not result in serious complications.

      ET affects approximately 5 million people in the United States. Incidence is highest in
      people over the age of 60.

      ET usually develops gradually during middle age or later in life. Symptoms may remain mild
      or become more severe over time. Stress, fatigue, anxiety, and hot or cold weather can
      worsen the disorder. Severe tremor may cause difficulty doing activities of daily living,
      such as:

        -  Brushing hair and teeth

        -  Holding a glass without spilling

        -  Performing self-care (e.g., getting dressed, shaving, putting on makeup)

      pregabalin be considered as an efficient medicine in the treatment of ET?

NCT00759993,Chromium Piccolinate in the Prevention of Weight Gain Induced by Serotonergic Medications Initiated on Psychiatric Inpatient Units.,"
      A majority of patients who suffer from mental illness are treated with serotonin regulating
      FDA approved medications. Some of these medications also block histamine transmission,
      increase blood prolactin levels, induce insulin resistance, hyperlipidemia, and promote
      sedation. All of which lead to weight gain and obesity. Many of these drugs are generally
      safe and effective but do carry the risk of a long term side effect in that acute and
      gradual weight gain of 10-30 pounds over a few months to a year of treatment. The
      detrimental gain of 7% of pre-drug weight is reported with many antipsychotics, mood
      stabilizers and some antidepressants. This weight gain may subsequently add to medical
      co-morbidity ( ie diabetes, hypertension, osteoarthritis, coronary artery diseasem,
      hyperlipidemia… ) This therapeutic manipulation of brain serotonin functioning may be
      associated with abnormal increases in carbohydrate cravings, consumption and weight gain. It
      is possible that insulin resistance occurs as a direct effect or as an indirect effect of
      weight gain, particularly in patients prone to weight gain or diabetes due to genetic
      loading. Leptin, a chemical associated with feedback signaling that reduces appetite and
      adipose tissue growth may also become insensitive. These multiple insults may lead to the
      worst weight gain in patients taking clozapine, olanzapine, and mirtazapine.

      Diet and exercise and lifestyle modification are the usual initial interventions, though
      being depressed, anxious, bipolar, or schizophrenic often interferes with the ability to
      make these changes. In fact most of the studies which look at these weight loss
      interventions occur in patients who are institutionalized, on restricted diets and may
      respond to token economy systems while on longer term inpatient unit stays. This token
      economy approach is not easily translated to usual outpatient or short term inpatient
      practice settings. In these settings, if lifestyle modification approaches fail, patients
      may be placed on FDA approved diet medications (sibutramine, orlistat, ionamin…) which carry
      significant side effect risks. Some patients are even placed on the epilepsy medications
      such as zonisamide or topiramate at an even greater side effect risk.

      In a similar weight gain prone group, there is growing literature in the diabetes population
      that the use of high dose chromium improves (lowers) insulin resistance by way of increasing
      insulin binding to cells, receptor numbers, and insulin receptor kinase activity. Lower
      fasting blood glucose levels in the blood generally occurs. Some reports show a reduction in
      blood lipid/cholesterol levels at higher chromium dosing as well. Recently, chromium
      piccolinate was studied in depressed patients, especially those with atypical features
      (usually fatigue, weight gain, carbohydrate cravings). Although there was no change in
      depression symptoms overall, carbohydrate cravings improved. This paper was presented at the
      2005 American Psychiatric Association Annual Meeting in Atlanta. As a foil, a few papers in
      non-diabetics,non-depressed healthy volunteers showed little to no effectiveness in lowering
      blood sugar levels. Furthermore, one investigator (JLM) has published data showing acute ,
      clinically significant weightgain in serotonergically treated psychiatric inpatients. The
      authors theorize that the use of chromium may reduce carbohydrate craving, appetite and thus
      protect against weight gain side effects.

      Given this pivotal paper in the depressed population, effectiveness data in the diabetes
      population and some possible metabolic ties between these two populations, the author wishes
      to study the effect of chromium piccolinate in mentally ill subjects who are being started
      on serotonergic manipulating medications while in an inpatient treatment setting. These
      patients will be followed during their inpatient stay and then be followed after discharge
      for a single visit to determine acute interventional effects of chromium piccolinate. We
      feel chromium piccolinate is less toxic/hazardous than many of the weght loss medications
      that we currently use and therefore suggest a long term randomized, controlled study where
      subjects will receive active drug (chromium piccolinate) or placebo at the start of any
      serotonergic treatment while inpatient. The chromium piccolinate and the placbo will be
      obtained from the Nutrition 21 company, which has been approved by the FDA as a source of
      this product.

NCT00948610,Sleep and Immunity in Rheumatoid Arthritis : Remicade Substudy,"
      More than half of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients complain of sleep disturbance and this
      cardinal complaint is associated with fatigue, pain, and depressed mood in patient with
      chronic inflammatory disorder. Despite the frequency of this complain, there is limited
      efforts to evaluate sleep or the abnormal increases in the expression of proinflamatory
      cytokines play a key role in the progression of RA, we hypothesize that the cytokine network
      is one physiological system that is associated with sleep disturbances in RA patients.
      Proinflamatory cytokines signal the central nervous system and are associated with increased
      symptoms of pain, fatigue, and depressed mood in rheumatic patients. Moreover, sleep loss is
      coincident with alterations in sympathetic tone, which is thought to contribute to increases
      of proinflammatory cytokine activity. The specific aims of the study are to examine the
      contribution of cytokines on sleep by administering a TNF antagonist vs. placebo to probe
      the action of proinflammatory cytokines on sleep in RA Patients. Examination of sleep and
      its consequences for autonomic functioning and proinflamatory cytokine activity within the
      framework of an observational and experimental research design will have implications for
      understanding the psycho-biological mechanisms that link sleep and the clinical
      manifestations of RA. Results from this study will guide the developments of interventions

NCT01260532,The Association of Costimulatory Molecules and PPAR-polymorphisms With Autoimmune Thyroid Disease in Taiwan,"
      Autoimmune thyroid disease is the most common organ-specific autoimmune disease. AITD
      include Graves' disease and Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Although the pathogenesis of AITD
      remains unclear, it is generally thought that the mechanisms of the disease is a complex
      disease in which susceptibility genes and environmental triggers act in concert to initiate
      the autoimmune response to the thyroid.

      The initial step of thyroid autoimmunity is the activation of T cells. The activation of T
      cell requires two signals: firstly, thyroid follicular cells or antigen presenting cells
      binds to T cell receptor through antigenic HLA complex. Secondly, the activation of T cells
      is also required the interaction of costimulatory molecules between thyroid follicular cells
      and immune cells, including CTLA-4, CD 40, CD28, ICOS. PPAR- is a kind of intranuclear
      transcription factor, associated with adipogenesis and inflammation. Some reports showed
      that PPAR- polymorphism may have a protective effect from Graves' ophthalmopathy.

      The goal of the study is to investigate the relationship among SNP and mRNA of costimulatory
      molecules and PPAR- , serum cytokine including TNF- and sIL-2R, and clinical characteristics
      in AITD patients. From the study, we hope to clarify the role of costimulatory molecules and

      Medical management of central hypothyroidism is controversial due to lack of reference for
      evaluation of pituitary negative feedback. Therefore, titration of medical treatment is
      based on T4 levels, measured with variable laboratory methods. Patients who have central
      hypothyroidism usually have concomitant deficiencies in other pituitary hormones for which
      they need replacement therapy such as steroids, testosterone and growth hormone. This
      combined hormone deficiency makes clinical and laboratory evaluation challenging among these
      patients. Symptomatically, central hypothyroidism is relatively mild and lack non-specific
      and it might be overlooked due to other hormonal deficiencies. Replacement therapy for
      central hypothyroidism is titrated by arbitrary target free T4 levels of above 50th
      percentile of normal. The goal of our study is to compare the standard results from well
      known measure methods to a new method for measuring Ft4 using Liquid chromatography - tandem

      In HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, trastuzumab based treatment is the standard of
      care as long as there are no contraindications to trastuzumab. Frequently, trastuzumab is
      being combined with taxanes in the first-line setting. However, since therapy with
      trastuzumab is active even in the absence of chemotherapy in HER2-positive MBC, the optimal
      treatment strategy either in combination or in sequence with chemotherapy is still under
      debate. This randomized phase II trial is studying a new strategy for the treatment of
      metastatic breast cancer with HER2-positive. First-line treatment consists of trastuzumab
      and pertuzumab, a treatment without chemotherapy. In case of disease progression,
      chemotherapy with T-DM1 is then performed as second-line treatment. Third-line and further
      line therapies are performed according to the physician's discretion. If this new

      Obesity is a major risk factor for disease and a public health problem. Recent information
      suggests that while it is possible for most overweight adults to lose a substantial amount
      of weight, maintaining the weight loss for any extended time (2 to 3 years) is very
      difficult. This is because trying to maintain big changes in exercise and/or eating
      behaviour is very difficult in today's environment that makes sustain big changes in
      behaviour (Example: eat allot less or exercise allot more) very hard. In fact at this time
      health professionals are unsure of how best to help overweight adults maintain big
      behavioral changes for long periods of time. In response, we propose that making smaller
      changes in eating and exercise habits every day may be possible in today's environment and
      if so, small weight changes may be possible to maintain for long periods of time. This study
      is designed to assess whether making small changes in eating and exercise behavior will be

NCT02126683,The Effect of Plaquenil on Serum Inflammatory Markers and Goiter in Euthyroid Young Women With Hashimoto's Thyroiditis,"
      Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) is a common form of autoimmune thyroid disease, which affects
      up to 2% of general population. The annual incidence of HT worldwide is estimated to be 0.8
      - 3.5 cases per 1000 persons. The thyroid gland attacked by a variety of cell- and
      antibody-mediated immune processes. Various auto-antibodies may be present against TPO and
      Tg, and ADCC is a substantial factor behind the apoptotic fall-out of HT. Activation of
      cytotoxic T-lymphocytes in response to cell-mediated immune response affected by helper
      T-cells is central to thyrocyte destruction. Recent studies showed higher pro-inflammatory
      cytokines in serum of patients with HT, and suggested HT is associated with regulatory
      T-cells dysfunction, imbalance of ratio of Th1 cell and Th2 cell, overexpression of Th17
      cells.

      Several studies suggested that pregnant women with HT, even at euthyroid state had higher
      risk of spontaneous miscarriage, more frequent post-partum depression and higher depressive,
      anger, and total mood disturbance risk compared to those without HT. Presence of thyroid
      auto-antibodies is also associated with negative pregnant outcomes including gestational
      hypertension, late abortion, fetal death, premature delivery and neonatal respiratory
      distress. Neonates from mothers with ATD have higher rate of transient hypothyroidism.
      Children of mothers with ATD had higher risk of positive serum thyroid auto-antibodies and
      development of goiter and thyroid dysfunction. However, there is no suggested treatment for
      subjects with HT who have normal thyroid function. Low-iodine diet and regularly follow-up
      were suggested.

      Plaquenil (hydroxychloroquine) is an anti-malarial agent, and has been used to treat several
      autoimmune diseases, including lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis for more than a
      century. It reduced lymphocytes, production of auto-antibodies, cytokines, and immune
      mediators, NK cell activity, and inhibits antigens presenting to CD4 T-cells of B cells,

      Every day in Ghana, 47 babies are stillborn (SB) and 232 babies are born with low
      birth-weight (LBW) - many of whom will die in infancy or suffer lifelong consequences.

      Sleeping on the back during pregnancy has recently emerged in scientific literature as a
      potential risk factor for SB and LBW. In fact, one of the earliest studies to demonstrate
      this link was conducted in Ghana by investigators on this protocol.

      When a woman in mid-to-late-pregnancy lies on her back, her large uterus compresses one of
      the major veins that delivers blood back to her heart and may completely obstruct it. This
      may result in less blood being returned to her heart and less blood being pumped to her
      developing fetus. Such changes may negatively impact the growth of her fetus and, along with
      some other risk factors, may contribute to the death of her baby.

      The investigators have developed a device, 'PrenaBelt', to significantly reduce the amount
      of time a pregnant woman spends sleeping on her back. The PrenaBelt functions via a simple,
      safe, effective, and well-established modality called positional therapy.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of the PrenaBelt on birth-weight and
      assess the feasibility of introducing it to Ghanaian third-trimester pregnant women in their
      home setting via an antenatal care clinic and local health-care staff. Data from this study
      will be used in effect size calculations for the design of a large-scale, epidemiological

      South Asians have a much higher risk of diabetes compared to Europeans and investigators
      don't know why this is. Investigators think that South Asians' capacity to store fat safely
      under the skin is lower than Europeans, so they start to store fat around internal organs
      and in liver and muscle, and at lower body weights than Europeans. These increased levels of
      internal fat storage are thought to increase risk of diabetes.

      The purpose of the study therefore is to investigate whether there are differences with
      weight gain and weight loss in fat storage, fat cell function and metabolic risk factors, in
      South Asians compared with Europeans. Investigators will compare South Asian and European
      men at the start of the study, after they have gained about 7% body weight, and again after
      they have lost 7-15% body weight (from peak weight) to see how gaining and losing weight

      to devascularize the thyroid, thus resulting in post-operative hypothyroidism.

      Synthroid is a synthetic thyroid hormone often used in cases of patients with proven
      hypothyroidism and after surgical thyroid removal. It's use has been in effect and studied
      for over fifty years.

      Treatment algorithms for hypothyroidism are well published. However, treatment of
      subclinical hypothyroidism (elevated TSH with normal or near-normal T3/T4) is controversial.
      The rate of subclinical hypothyroidism after non-thyroid head and neck surgery is high (up
      to 20%), and is associated with post-operative complications as noted above.

      Therefore the investigators propose a double blinded randomized controlled trial comparing
      outcomes of patients that develop subclinical hypothyroidism after head and neck surgery,
      who are given a standardized dose of synthroid treatment versus those treated with placebo.
      The main outcomes to be examined are post-operative complications (wound healing issues,
      fistula formation), survival, and quality of life measures.

NCT00314548,Inhaled Prostacyclin for Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and Pulmonary Hypertension,"
      Summary of the proposed research:

      The intravenous application of prostacyclin (PGE1) or its stable analogue, iloprost, has
      been used to cause a decrease not only of the pulmonary but also of the systemic vascular
      tone. Aerosolized prostacyclin, on the other hand, can result in a selective pulmonary
      vasodilatation without affecting the systemic blood pressure as shown in preliminary
      studies/case reports. No large trials exist for this type of use of the drug so far.
      Furthermore, aerosolized PGI2 can improve gas exchange and pulmonary shunt in clinical
      settings of impaired ventilation/perfusion ratio as it occurs in adult respiratory distress
      syndrome (ARDS) due to the redistribution of pulmonary blood flow from non-ventilated to
      ventilated, aerosol accessible lung regions. Therefore, the investigators propose to carry
      out a prospective, double blinded, randomized trial to show that the nebulized iloprost
      decreases pulmonary hypertension selectively and improves oxygenation in ARDS.

NCT00341848,Postpartum Uterine Regression,"
      Uterine leiomyomas are the leading cause of hysterectomy in the United States, accounting
      for over 200,000 procedures each year. Most epidemiologic studies of uterine leiomyoma show
      that parity has a protective association with leiomyoma, but the mechanism is not known.
      Both epidemiologic data and data from an animal model indicate that the protective
      association is not an artifact resulting from reduced fertility among women with fibroids.
      We hypothesize that the process of uterine regression following delivery results in loss of
      small fibroids due to selective apoptosis of transformed cells and the extensive remodeling
      of the entire uterus.

NCT00692198,Long-term Oxygen Treatment Trial,"
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a serious respiratory disease in which the
      airways in the lungs are partially blocked, resulting in symptoms of chest tightness,
      coughing, and difficulty breathing. Currently, there are many available treatments for
      managing COPD symptoms and improving quality of life, including medications, lifestyle
      changes, oxygen therapy, and pulmonary rehabilitation. For people with severe COPD that is
      characterized by very low blood oxygen levels at rest, long term oxygen therapy can help to
      prolong life and promote feelings of well-being. However, the effectiveness of supplemental
      oxygen therapy for people with COPD that is characterized by only moderately low blood
      oxygen levels at rest or normal blood oxygen at rest and desaturation on exercise is not
      known. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of supplemental oxygen therapy in treating

NCT00712998,X-Ray Computed Tomography and Blood Reactive Oxygen Species Level,"
      The clinically widely used X-ray computed tomography examination has a low-grade radiation
      effect and recently has attracted much attention concerning the possible adverse effects of
      radiation on human body [ref. 1-5]. The radiation is harmful to human tissues and cells
      mainly because it can interact with water (which makes up to 80% of cells) to generate
      reactive oxygen species (ROS), especially the formation of hydroxyl radicals. So far as we
      can reach, there is no report concerning the relation between X-ray computed tomography
      examination and the blood ROS concentration. Therefore, we wish to conduct this study to
      clarify if the routinely applied X-ray computed tomography examination may induce a higher
      concentration of ROS in the peripheral blood.

      Study subjects will be participants of health check program at our hospital. The only
      enrollment condition will be a scheduled X-ray computed tomography examination for either
      lung (20 cases) or heart (20 cases) of the study subject. Another 20 participants receiving
      health check program without X-ray computed tomography examination will be included as the
      control group. The formal consent will be delivered to the participants of health check
      program several days before their admission for health check and will be retrieved before
      the proceeding of health check.

      Measurements and comparison of ROS concentration will be performed in the sampled peripheral
      blood before and after the performance of X-ray computed tomography examination during a
      regular health check program. Totally 120 blood samples will be collected from included 60
      study subjects within 3 months. Reactive oxygen species（ROS）levels will be measured by a

      concentration will sustain subjective improvement in their perception of dyspnea based upon
      their reported Borg dyspnea score, during inhalation of NO.

      Specific aims

        1. Test if patients with acute PE and shortness of breath of severity ≥ 5 on a 0-10 scale
           called the Borg score can have inhaled nitric oxide administered via nasal cannula or
           face mask in a titration protocol that increases concentration by 5 ppm in 5 min steps
           to a maximum of 25 ppm.

        2. We will measure the number of patients who meet an absolute safety endpoint during
           titration. An absolute safety endpoint requires execution of a rapid weaning protocol
           (2 ppm decrease per minute to 0 ppm).

           Absolute safety endpoints: Two consecutive SBP measurements more than one min apart
           with both readings < 80 mm Hg;SaO 2 <80% for more than 15 seconds; Patient
           deterioration as defined by: Clinical decision for need of inotropic or pressor support
           for any reason, seizure, new altered mental status, focal neurological signs suggestive
           of cerebral ischemia, evidence of myocardial ischemia, protracted vomiting.

           will not be told any details about the timing of the titration and will not be made
           aware of their iNO concentration when the Borg score is assessed.

NCT01232387,Identification of Early Predictors of Fetomaternal Hemorrhage,"
      Objectives: 1) To determine risk factors for fetomaternal hemorrhage. 2) To identify a
      cost-effective method to detect fetomaternal hemorrhage prior to significant fetal anemia.

      Significance/Background: Fetomaternal hemorrhage (FMH) is a condition in which occurs when
      the placenta transfers blood from the fetus to the mother. Normally, nutrition and gasses
      pass from mother to baby through the placenta and only waste products pass from baby to
      mother through the placenta. Whole blood cells do not normally cross the placenta in
      significant amounts. Mild FMH, where a small amount of whole blood passes from fetus to
      mother but does not hurt the mother or baby, occurs in about 75% of pregnancies. A pregnant
      woman does not know this occurs. It is only discovered if a special blood test that is
      labor-intensive to perform and difficult to interpret called the Kleihauer-Betke acid
      elution test is done. As mild FMH hurts no one, this test is not part of routine care. In
      most cases, testing is done only if a baby is born sick with unexplained anemia. Severe FMH,
      which can cause the baby to become sick from anemia (low red blood cell count) is caused by
      large blood loss into the mother, occurs in only 1-3 per 1000 births. Severe anemia caused
      by FMH can result in death of the baby before or after birth, or significant illness in the
      newborn period. Short term problems for the baby include difficulty breathing, difficulty
      maintaining blood pressure, and difficulty providing oxygen to all parts of the body. This
      can cause multiple problems with the function of internal organs including the liver,
      kidneys, intestines, and brain. Babies who become sick from severe FMH can develop long-term
      problems including cerebral palsy (a lifelong problem with body movements) and/or mental
      retardation.

      It is not known why some pregnancies are affected by FMH and others are not. It is thought
      that FMH may occur more frequently now than in the past, but no one knows why. If identified
      early, FMH is readily treatable by blood transfusion of the baby before or after birth
      and/or early delivery. Current laboratory testing for FMH is difficult and expensive. There
      is great need identify high risk patients early in pregnancy in order to treat the condition
      before the baby gets sick.

      Approach: Five hundred women will be asked to participate in the study at the time they are
      admitted to the Mount Sinai labor floor for delivery at term. After birth, newborns of study
      mothers will be tested for anemia. Mothers of anemic babies will donate blood for
      confirmation of FMH by established laboratory methods as well as for development of a new
      laboratory screening protocol. All mothers will provide medical, social, environmental, and
      full pregnancy history. Risk factors for FMH will be identified by statistical analysis of
      this information.

      In the United States, depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) is given to women after
      delivery and before hospital discharge with the belief that women who delay starting DMPA
      may be more likely to become pregnant when they are not yet ready to be pregnant and that
      giving DMPA before discharge has little to no negative effect on breastfeeding.
      Administering DMPA to breastfeeding women has not been widely questioned because the limited

NCT01689961,Be Healthy in Pregnancy (BHIP) With Nutrition and Exercise,"
      Excess weight gain in pregnancy is a major problem affecting 55-75% of Canadian women who
      enter pregnancy overweight or obese and about 40% of women who are normal weight. Excess
      weight gain puts mothers at risk for health problems such as diabetes and developing or
      sustaining obesity after pregnancy, and puts their babies at risk of being born too large or
      developing related health problems. Mothers will be randomized to a structured high dairy
      protein diet and walking program or the usual care by their care provider. The investigators
      research questions are: Will a structured nutrition and exercise program in pregnancy
      compared to usual prenatal care increase the chance that mothers will achieve pregnancy
      weight gain within the current recommendations; improve health measures, in mother and
      infant at six months post-partum; to evaluate the benefits of a high dairy intake in
      pregnancy on maintenance of bone status in the mother and bone health outcomes in the child
      in early life (6 months); and to investigate the interactions between genes associated with
      bone health and high dairy diet supplementation on bone status in mothers during pregnancy,
      and bone health in mothers post-delivery and children to 6 months of age. Mothers' weight,
      physical activity and adherence to the nutrition plan will be assessed until birth and at
      follow-up with their infants at 6 months after birth. The research team will ensure new
      information is quickly transferred to programs to assist women to have healthier

      Adequate perfusion and oxygenation is essential for the function of the inner retina.
      Although it is known that oxygen tension is very well autoregulated in the retina, the
      physiological mechanisms behind this regulation process are not fully explored. The
      development of new instruments for the non-invasive measurement of oxygen tension in retinal

NCT01959009,High Frequency Oscillatory Ventilation Combined With Intermittent Sigh Breaths: Effects on Blood Oxygenation and Stability of Oxygenation,"
      Background:

      Ventilator induced lung injury (VILI) remains a problem in neonatology. High frequency
      oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) provides effective gas exchange with minimal pressure
      fluctuation around a continuous distending pressure and therefore small tidal volume. Animal
      studies showed that recruitment and maintenance of functional residual capacity (FRC) during
      HFOV (""open lung concept"") could reduce lung injury.

      ""Open lung HFOV"" is achieved by delivering a moderate high mean airway pressure (MAP) using
      oxygenation as a guide of lung recruitment. Some neonatologists suggest combining HFOV with
      recurrent sigh-breaths (HFOV-sigh) delivered as modified conventional ventilator-breaths at
      a rate of 3/min. The clinical observation is that HFOV-sigh leads to more stable
      oxygenation, quicker weaning and shorter ventilation. This may be related to improved lung
      recruitment. This has however to our knowledge not been tested in a clinical trial using
      modern ventilators.

      Purpose, aims:

        -  To compare HFOV-sigh with HFOV-only and determine if there is a difference in
           oxygenation expressed as a/A-ratio and/or stability of oxygenation expressed as
           percentage time with oxygen saturation outside the reference range.

        -  To provide information on feasibility and treatment effect of HFOV-sigh to assist
           planning larger studies. We hypothesize that oxygenation is better during HFOV-sigh.

      Methods:

      Infants at 24-36 weeks corrected gestational age already on HFOV are eligible. Patients will
      be randomly assigned to HFOV-sigh (3 breaths/min) followed by HFOV-only or vice versa for 4
      alternating 1-hours periods (2-treatment, double crossover design, each patient being its
      own control). During HFOV-sigh set-pressure will be reduced to keep MAP constant, otherwise
      HFOV will remain at pretrial settings. Outcome will be calculated from normal clinical
      parameters including pulx-oximetry and transcutaneous monitoring of oxygen and
      carbon-dioxide partial pressures.

NCT01991886,Using Nasal High Flow From Birth in Premature Infants - a Pilot Study,"
      Recent large studies have shown that not all premature babies need to be intubated (have a
      breathing tube inserted) and ventilated, nor do they all need to be given lung surfactant
      routinely. Those studies showed that even very small babies can be safely supported using
      nasal Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (nCPAP) which is applied tightly to the nose using
      nasal prongs. This is a type of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) so that the babies continue to
      breath, albeit with additional support to reduce their work of breathing. However nCPAP has
      some drawbacks, including that it can cause skin damage to the nose, and that the heating
      and humidification of the gas is not always sufficient. We have been using, for over 5
      years, a different system to support babies after routine intubation. This is another type
      of noninvasive ventilation called nasal High Flow (nHF) for which we use a Vapotherm
      Precision Flow device. Published trials show that it is at least as effective as nCPAP to
      provide NIV and to prevent the subsequent need for intubation and/or surfactant. However nHF
      is superior to nCPAP in respect it does not cause nose damage and its heating and
      humidification is excellent. This pilot study aims to describe and evaluate the use of nHF,
      using a standard commercially available system (Precision Flow, Vapotherm Inc.), from birth,
      in babies born less than 30 completed weeks gestation, with a view to avoiding intubation
      and ventilation. This study is important to establish the feasibility of using nHF
      immediately after birth.

      Postoperative venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a significant health-care problem, resulting
      in significant morbidity, mortality and resource utilization. The true incidence is unknown,
      and may range from 1% to 15%. At the current time, the clinical practice of VTE prophylaxis
      in thoracic surgery includes administration of unfractionated or low molecular weight
      heparin starting at the perioperative period and finishing at the time of patients'
      discharge. In orthopaedic surgery, prolonged thromboprophylaxis beyond 10 days and up to 35
      days has become the standard of care. There is a clear need to systematically evaluate the
      incidence of VTE after resection of lung malignancies and to evaluate the role of extended
      VTE prophylaxis in preventing Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolus (PE) after
      those major lung resections. This study will involve patients undergoing lung resection for
      malignancy at St. Joseph's Healthcare Hamilton and the University Health Network's Toronto
      General Hospital. The study will include 150 consecutively recruited patients. Study
      interventions will include Computed Tomography with pulmonary embolus (PE) protocol and
      bilateral extended leg Doppler Ultrasound for the detection of Deep Vein Thrombosis 30 days
      post-surgery.

      In summary, this study is aimed at evaluating, for the first time in a prospective manner,

      post-operative thromboprophylaxis with an extended 30-day prophylaxis protocol with the hope
      of providing an evidence-based practice change in VTE prophylaxis care for this high risk

      PostPartum hemorrhage (PPH) is a major cause of maternal death worldwide. Oxytocin is the
      most commonly used uterotonic drug to prevent and treat PPH in North America. However
      oxytocin has a very short duration of action, requiring a continuous infusion to achieve
      sustained uterotonic activity. Moreover large doses are associated with adverse effects like
      hypotension, nausea, vomiting, dysrhythmias and ST changes. The Society of Obstetricians and
      Gynecologists of Canada (SOGC) has recommended a single dose of 100 mcg of carbetocin at
      elective cesarean delivery to promote uterine contraction. In three studies recently
      performed at Mount Sinai Hospital, the investigators have found no difference in uterine
      contractility between the doses of 20- 120 mcg carbetocin and that the ED90 is 14.8 mcg.
      Thus a larger trial comparing the minimum effective dose determined in the previous three
      trials with the standard 100 mcg dose is necessary to confirm these findings.

      The investigators will test the hypothesis that oxygen concentration during the period of

      high flow (15 liters/minute) oxygen delivery. Specific measurements include oxygen
      concentration at subjects' lips and pharynx when breathing 100% oxygen and room air via a
      simple mask, non-rebreather mask, OxyMaskTM, and anesthesia mask with headstrap and Jacson
      Rees circuit.

      A mean difference of 10% pharyngeal FiO2 between any of the masks will be considered

      year old to generate around 20% of the volume of air inhaled or exhaled in a single normal
      breath (also known as tidal volume). This showed that a non-invasive method could be used to
      provide a temporary means of artificial breathing, meaning that invasive procedures, such as
      putting in a breathing tube, could be avoided. What our results did not tell us, however, is
      how much oxygen can get to peripheral tissues (e.g., arms, legs) with this method. In this

NCT00006196,"The Relationship Between Vitamin D, Fingernail Thickness and Bone Density","
      Vitamin D deficiency is common in the elderly and contributes to the increased incidence of
      falls, hip fracture and depression in this population. An unknown number of elderly have
      vitamin D resistance resulting in a functional vitamin D deficiency state. Because there are
      no simple procedures or blood tests that identify vitamin D resistance, its prevalence and
      contribution to disability in the elderly is unknown. Our inability to screen for this
      condition precludes our ability to initiate and monitor treatment.

      Previous studies indicate that fingernail thickness correlates with vitamin D status and may
      therefore provide a simple cost effective procedure to not only identify patients with
      vitamin D deficiency but also, those with vitamin D resistance. This procedure may also
      provide a way to monitor an individual's response to treatment.

NCT00302692,Use of Beta Blockers in Elderly Trauma Patients,"
      Advances in medical care have increased the proportion of elderly Americans and enabled them
      to remain more physically active. This has resulted in an unprecedented increase in the
      number of geriatric patients admitted to trauma centers. The elderly constitute 23% of
      trauma center admissions, but 36% of all trauma deaths. This disproportionately high
      mortality is attributable to a higher prevalence of pre-existing conditions, particularly,
      cardiac disease. Multi-system injuries result in critical cardiac stress. Although
      beta-blockade has been shown to decrease morbidity and mortality in patients at risk for
      myocardial infarction after elective surgery, their use in trauma patients with potential
      underlying cardiac disease has not been previously studied. We hypothesize that routine
      administration of beta-blockers after resuscitation will reduce morbidity and mortality in
      elderly trauma patients with, or at risk for, underlying cardiac disease.

      This study is a randomized, prospective clinical trial. One cohort will receive routine
      trauma intensive care, and the other, the same care plus beta-blockade after completion of
      resuscitation. The primary outcome will be mortality. Secondary outcomes include MI, length
      of stay, organ dysfunction, cardiac, and other complications.

      Changes in outcome may not be due to reduction in myocardial oxygen demand and heart rate.
      Laboratory studies demonstrate that circulating inflammatory cytokines contribute to cardiac
      risk in trauma patients, and their production is influenced by adrenergic stimulation. We
      will measure circulating IL-6, TNF alpha, IL-1beta, and measure NF-kB and p38 MAP kinase
      activation in peripheral blood leukocytes, and determine the effect of beta-blockade on the
      production of these inflammatory markers.

      Finally, the wide variation in patient response to beta-blockers is attributed to genetic
      variability in the adrenergic receptor. Therefore, we will identify single nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPS) within the beta-adrenergic receptor, and determine their effects on
      mortality and response to beta-blockade. This study will provide the first randomized,
      prospective trial designed to reduce morbidity and mortality in elderly trauma patients at
      risk for cardiac disease. The laboratory and genetic component will provide additional
      insights that may explain treatment effects, lead to new therapeutic strategies, and have
      the potential to lead to additional areas of investigation.

NCT00512655,Trial to Reduce Falls Incidence Rate in Frail Elderly,"
      Background: Approximately 750,000 elderly Dutch people fall at least once a year, which
      often results in physical injuries and a fear of falling, with high costs and far-reaching
      consequences on functionality, physical activity, quality of life and mental well-being.
      Falling is not only a burden for patients, it is also a burden for their caregivers.
      Recurrent falling is a complex problem. However, the pathophysiological background of falls,
      gait problems and dementia is largely unknown. The general pathophysiological hallmark of
      aging is a liability in homeostatic mechanisms of organs. This liability results in an
      impaired ability to adapt to stress and in increased biological variation in outcome
      measures within individuals. In this study the investigators aim at developing an
      intervention to reduce recurrent falling in frail elderly fallers.

      Hypotheses: The investigators hypothesize that the intervention program will decrease the
      number of falls and fear of falling and increase mental well-being, physical activity and
      functional performance in frail elderly people with a history of recurrent falling. In
      addition, the burden on the caregivers will be reduced due to the intervention and will be
      cost-effective. Furthermore, the investigators hypothesize that patients with a high
      short-term intra-individual biological variability in gait and cognition variables have a
      higher risk of falling, worse gait performance and cognitive decline after long term
      follow-up.

      Study Design: Randomized, controlled, single-blind trial.

      Study Population: 160 patients referred to a geriatric outpatient clinic, who fell at least
      once in the last 6 months and their primary caregivers (N=160).

      Intervention: A multifaceted fall prevention program for frail elders to reduce falls
      incidence rate, consisting of physical and cognitive components. Moreover, it includes a
      training program for caregivers in which they learn to support and give advice to the
      patients, aiming to decrease the burden on the caregivers.

      Primary Outcome Measures: The fall incidence rate is the primary outcome measure. Total
      observation time of falls will be 6 months after the start of the intervention.

      Secondary Outcome Measures: In the patients, the secondary outcome measures are fear of
      falling (FES), quality of life (MOS-20), depression and general anxiety, functional
      performance in activities of daily living, physical activity, mobility, gait parameters,
      body sway and biomarkers of endothelial function and frailty. For the caregiver, the
      secondary outcome measures are caregiver's burden, mood and quality of life. In addition,
      intraindividual variability of cognition, balance and gait in both patients and caregivers,
      will be assessed and cost-effectiveness of the intervention will also be determined.

NCT00928915,International Normalized Ratio (INR) Normalization in Coumadin Associated Intracerebral Haemorrhage,"
      Intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) is the most feared complication in patients on vitamin K
      antagonists (VKA). VKA related ICH occurs 8-10 times more frequently and the mortality is 2
      times higher than in non-anticoagulated patients. Mortality may rise up to 67%. The higher
      mortality rate may in part be due to the higher rate of haematoma expansion (HE) over a
      longer period after symptom onset. International guidelines recommend treatment of VKA-ICH
      with prothrombin complex (PCC) or fresh-frozen plasma (FFP) both in combination with
      Vitamin-K. But these recommendations are not based on randomized controlled trials. It is
      known that these drugs lower the INR, and thus it is assumed that normalization of
      coagulopathy may lead to haemostasis and reduction of HE. Safety and efficacy of these
      treatments have never been studied in a prospective controlled trial.

      The investigators' questions are: How potent are PCC and FFP in normalization of the INR?
      What is the safety profile of each of these drugs?

      Anti-aggregation therapy, including treatment with low-dose aspirin (LDA) is an established
      risk factor for intracranial hemorrhage, including chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH); however
      evidence guiding the decision to continue or discontinue LDA in patients who have sustained
      mild head trauma with no sign of injury on CT is lacking. The investigators aim to assess
      whether continued aspirin treatment increases the risk of CSDH in mild head trauma patients
      50 years and older who present with negative head CT. The investigators further aim to use
      the initial findings to refine the study design, with the goal of performing a larger,
      multi-institutional study in the future.

      Over a 12-month period, approximately 100 patients ≥50 years of age on LDA prophylaxis
      presenting to Hadassah's Emergency Department after sustaining mild head injury, will be
      examined by the neurosurgeon on call. Those who have no sign of intracranial hemorrhage at
      clinical or CT examination, and who meet inclusion / exclusion criteria, will be invited to
      participate in a randomized study. Informed consent will be obtained. Patients will be
      remotely randomized for continuation or cessation of LDA treatment. Follow-up CT and
      clinical examination will be performed 3-5 weeks after trauma.

      The two-proportions test will be used to assess whether there is a statistically significant
      difference in the rate of CSDH in patients randomized to cessation of LDA therapy and those
      randomized to continuation of LDA. Relationships between the explanatory the dependent
      variables will be explored with classical parametric and nonparametric statistical methods,
      including multivariate analysis, logistic regression, the two proportions test, and the
      independence test. Several measures of association/correlation between pairs of variables
      will be analyzed as well.

      The investigators hypothesize that continuation of LDA will not be associated with increased
      risk for chronic subdural hematoma, and that cessation of treatment will not be associated
      with a decrease in chronic subdural hematoma. The investigators further hypothesize that
      cessation of LDA for this period will not be associated with increased risk for clinically
      significant cerebrovascular, cardiovascular, thrombotic, of embolic event.

NCT01624545,To Scan or Not to Scan: The Role of Follow-up CT Scanning for Management of Chronic Subdural Hematoma After Neurosurgical Evacuation,"
      Chronic subdural hematoma (CSH) is one of the most common bleedings of the head. These
      hematomas develop after minor head trauma and increase in size over weeks. Patients usually
      present with headaches, gait disturbances, language problems or confusion. The state of the
      art treatment of a symptomatic chronic subdural hematoma is to remove the hematoma by burr
      hole trepanation.

      The optimal follow-up for operated patients remains controversial. Due to the known high
      rate of a second hematoma at the same place (usually within weeks), one strategy is to
      perform serial computer tomography scans in order to identify recurrent hematomas early. The
      radiologic evidence of a second hematoma often leads to reoperation, even if the patient has
      no, or just slight symptoms. Another strategy after surgical hematoma evacuation is to
      closely follow the patient with neurological examinations and perform neuroimaging only in
      case of new symptoms. Advocators of this strategy argue that a follow-up with routine CT
      scans may be harmful due to additional and maybe unnecessary surgeries and hospital days in
      a patient population marked by advanced age and fragility.

      The aim of the current study is to evaluate the role of computer tomography scanning in the
      postoperative follow-up after removal of a chronic subdural hematoma. Participants of this
      study will be allocated by chance to one of two study groups: Patients allocated to group A
      will receive a computer tomography scan on day 2 and again on day 30 after surgery in
      addition to a clinical examination. Patients allocated to group B will be examined
      clinically on day 2 and day 30 without computer tomography. All patients will undergo a
      final clinical examination after 6 months. The study will recruit 400 patients.

      Nowadays features for the diagnosis of delirium are:

        1. Disturbance of consciousness (i.e. reduced clarity of environment awareness) with
           reduced ability to focus, sustain or shift attention;

        2. A change in cognition (such as memory deficit, disorientation, language disturbance) or
           the development of a perceptual disturbance that is not better accounted for by a
           pre-existing or evolving dementia;

        3. The disturbance develops over a short period of time (usually hours to days) and its
           severity fluctuates during the course of the day;

        4. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings that
           the disorder is caused by the direct physiological consequences of a general medical
           condition, substance intoxication or substance withdrawal.

      Treatment of underlying clinical disease is important to remit the delirium. However, these

NCT01804426,Hair Cortisol Level as a Predictor of PTSD Development,"
      Post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD, is one of the most prevalent psychiatric disorders.

      As casualties of motor vehicle accidents, criminal acts or terrorism are arriving to the ER,
      it is almost impossible to conclude who will overcome his psychiatric trauma and will be
      able to return to his normal life course and who will be thrown out of his promising life
      trajectory.

      Current attempts to identify those who are at the greatest risk are still unsatisfactory,
      which comprise a therapeutic dilemma, since the interventions used to ameliorate and prevent
      the occurrence of PTSD in a high-risk patient, might be counter-productive and even
      precipitate the emergence of PTSD in lower-risk patients.

      Since PTSD is closely related to the ""Fight, Flight or Freeze"" reaction, it has much to do
      with the autonomic nervous system and the major stress hormone, cortisol. Despite many
      studies demonstrating the involvement of those factors in the development of PTSD, various
      attempts to profile the direction of the association between PTSD and cortisol abnormalities
      have yielded conflicting results.

      The introduction of a novel method of assessing the excretion of cortisol using residues in
      the human hair shaft, has allowed an unprecedented evaluation of its activity over a
      prolonged period of time.

      Using this novel method of cortisol assessment, the investigators aim to identify biomarkers
      that will be able to aid in the prediction of PTSD development ahead of symptoms emergence,

NCT01922115,The Effect of Anticholinergics on Cognitive Function in the Elderly,"
      Anticholinergic medication is used to treat overactive bladder (OAB). A known side effect of
      this medication is cognitive dysfunction. OAB is more prevalent in the elderly population -
      a group that also has a higher baseline risk of cognitive dysfunction. Our objective is to
      evaluate the effect of an anticholinergic medication on cognitive function in elderly women.
      Subjects will be randomized to:1) trospium chloride or 2) placebo. There are three aims: 1)
      To evaluate changes in cognitive function in elderly women taking trospium versus placebo,
      using validated cognitive assessment tests. 2) To develop a useful battery of cognitive
      screening tests for monitoring the cognitive safety of OAB management. 3) To understand how
      the timing of cognitive changes relates to the timing of improvement in OAB symptoms. The
      investigators will recruit 60 women aged ≥ 50 with the diagnosis of OAB. Cognitive
      assessments will be performed at baseline and Week 1 and 4 after drug initiation using
      paper-based validated questionnaires. OAB improvement will be assessed with validated

NCT01991405,Memory Aid - Working Memory Training in Patients With Mild Cognitive Impairment.,"
      Background:

      Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is a condition characterized by memory problems more severe
      than normal cognitive changes due to old age, and less severe than dementia. Reduced working
      memory (WM) is regarded as one of the core symptoms of an MCI-condition. Recent studies have
      indicated that WM can be improved trough computer based training.

      Objectives:

      The objective of the study is to evaluate if working memory training is effective in
      improving working memory in elderly MCI-patients. Further, to evaluate if cognitive training
      relates to structural changes in the white and gray matter of the brain, assessed by
      structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging. Cognitive phenotypes related to memory impairment and
      progression to dementia will also be investigated.

      Patients and Methods:

      The proposed study is a blinded, randomized and controlled trail that will include 90
      elderly patients from a Memory Clinic diagnosed with MCI. The groups will be randomized to
      either training or a placebo version. The intervention is computerized working memory
      training performed for 45 minutes over 25 sessions. Neuropsychological assessment and
      structural MRI will be performed before, 6 and 12 months after training.

      Relevance:

      Currently there is no known treatment available for mild memory impairment/MCI, and few
      studies on specific cognitive training in MCI-patients have been performed. The proposed
      study has received funding from a Norwegian Health Region. If computer based training
      results in positive changes to memory functions in MCI patients this may represent a new,
      cost-effective treatment. Secondly, evaluation of training induced structural changes to
      grey or white matter may improve our understanding of the mechanisms behind effective
      cognitive interventions in MCI patients.

NCT02028260,Modafinil Versus Placebo for Hypoactive Delirium in the Critically Ill,"
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study of 30 patients. Patients who
      qualify, as per the inclusion criteria (RASS greater than -3, less then +1, CAM positive,
      present gastric access) will either be given 200mg of modafinil or an identical,
      indistinguishable placebo. The placebo and study drug will be distributed by the hospital
      pharmacy. Once enrolled, each patient will be reassessed every morning to determine
      appropriateness for drug administration. If the RASS is less than -3 (i.e. comatose) or
      greater then 0 modafinil will not be given. He/she will then be assessed each morning
      thereafter. Due to the stimulant-like actions of modafinil, the drug will be administered
      only in the morning. Patients will be assessed for delirium at least twice a day; trained
      personnel using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) will do the assessment. Qualification
      for a delirium free day will be no positive CAM screens for 24 hours following drug
      administration. Additional data such as days on mechanical ventilation and progression to
      tracheotomy will also be collected hypothesizing that patients who take modafinil will have
      a shorter time to extubation therefore avoiding the need for a tracheotomy. Post-discharge
      from the unit, but within 48 hours, patients will be asked to participate in a survey (The
      Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire (RCSQ) assessing their perception of daytime and
      nighttime sleepiness in the intensive care unit as well as their overall perception of rest.
      Their functional capacity will also be evaluated at this time and compared to their
      pre-morbid baseline. The hypothesis tested is that Modafinil restores sleep cycle synchrony
      in the ICU therefore increasing delirium free days and improving ICU outcomes.

      Through many years, the standard care has been to use continuous sedation of critically ill
      patients during mechanical ventilation. However, preliminary randomised clinical trials
      indicate that it is beneficial to reduce the sedation level in these patients. The NONSEDA
      trial is an investigator-initiated, randomised, clinical, parallel-group, multinational,
      superiority trial designed to include 700 patients from at least six ICUs in Denmark, Norway
      and Sweden, comparing no sedation with sedation and a daily wake-up trial during mechanical
      ventilation. This is a substudy of the NONSEDA trial, concerning 250 patients included at
      trialsite Kolding, Denmark. The aim of the substudy is to assess the effects of no sedation
      on delirium during admission and cognitive function after discharge from ICU.

      Our hypothesis is that critically ill patients who are not sedated during mechanical
      ventilation will have better cognitive function after discharge.

NCT02172625,The Effect of Protandim Supplementation on Oxidative Damage and Athletic Performance,"
      Nutrition supplementation with antioxidants have been discussed as a way to further enhance
      overall well-being of athletes, promote faster recovery, and improve overall performance.
      The use of Protandim, a nutritional supplement containing 5 botanicals (Bacoba extract 150
      mg; milk thistle 225mg; ashwaganda 150 mg; green tea 75 mg; turmeric 75 mg) has shown
      promise in an earlier study by reducing oxidative stress and increasing the amount of the
      anti-oxidant enzymes in the blood.

      The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of ~90 day Protandim supplementation on
      5-km running performance and on acute and long term oxidative damage as assessed by blood
      markers. Secondarily, another purpose of this study is to examine the effect of Protandim
      supplementation on measures of measures of quality of life. The experiment will be
      double-blind, placebo controlled. The study will address four specific research questions:

        1. Does regular supplementation of Protandim (675 mg/day for 90 days) reduce oxidative
           damage at rest as assessed by lipid peroxides (TBARS) in runners? Hypothesis: Based on
           the data by Nelson et al. (2006), oxidative damaged will be reduced by 40% (effect size
           = 4.8)

        2. Does regular supplementation of Protandim (675 mg/day for 90 days) in runners reduce
           the increase in oxidative damage post-race compared to pre-race as assessed by lipid
           peroxides (TBARS)? Hypothesis: Based on the data by Kyparos et al. (2009), we expect a
           45% increase in TBARS post-exercise compared to pre-exercise (effect size of 3.6).
           However, we expect that those that are on Protandim for 90 days will only have 31%
           increase in TBARS post-race (effect size = 2.5) [based on changes in pre-post lipid
           peroxides from Arent et al. (2010)]

        3. Does regular supplementation of Protandim (675 mg/day for 90 days) improve 5-km running
           times? Hypothesis: Protandim will improve 5-km running time by 0.5 min (SD 1-min). This
           is equivalent to an effect size of 0.5. The placebo group will have no change in
           performance.

        4. Does regular supplementation of Protandim (675 mg/day for 90 days) improve either the
           physical or mental component of quality of life according to the physical and
           psychological component of the WHOQOL-BREF (Skevington, Lotfy, O'Connell, & Group,

NCT02266563,Amyloid and Tauopathy PET Imaging in Acute and Chronic Traumatic Brain Injury,"
      The potential long-term effects of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) are poorly understood.
      Repeated concussions have been associated with an elevated incidence of Alzheimer's disease
      (AD) along with a reduced age of onset. As repetitive TBI has been studied, a syndrome has
      now been identified: chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). There are growing concerns
      about the long-term neurologic consequences of head impact exposure from routine
      participation in contact sports (e.g., boxing, football). Brain autopsies of athletes with
      confirmed CTE have demonstrated tau-immunoreactive neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil
      threads (known as tauopathy). The relationship between exposure to repetitive head impact
      and the subsequent development of chronic neurodegenerative disease has not been
      established. Further, as the diagnosis of CTE (defined by the presence of tauopathy) is
      presently made after death at autopsy, clinical tools and biomarkers for detecting it remain
      to be defined.

      With the advent of FDA-approved PET amyloid imaging, clinicians and researchers are now able
      to estimate plaque density in the brains of living patients. However, there are critical
      limitations to amyloid imaging. Current evidence suggests that markers of the presence and
      severity of tauopathy may be able to address these limitations. The study will utilize both
      [18F] Florbetapir and [18F]-T807 PET imaging to investigate amyloid and tau accumulation in
      subjects with a history of concussions. In order to determine whether problems with
      cognition and memory are seen within the populations defined for the study, the researchers
      will administer a core battery of neurocognitive testing. This battery will assess cognitive
      abilities commonly affected by TBI, including processing speed, reaction time, new
      problem-solving, executive functions, attention and concentration, and learning and memory.
      These tests, in conjunction with the imaging, will be able to determine whether regional
      brain activity is associated with specific cognitive problems. The researchers will obtain
      PET and neurocognitive data in 3 cohorts: subjects with a history of TBIs, subjects with
      mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and no TBI history, and healthy controls.

      The investigators aim to determine whether individuals with TBI are on the same trajectory
      of neurodegenerative disease seen in AD or in CTE. Because of the overlap in
      clinical/cognitive and some behavioral symptoms in AD and CTE, an additional biomarker tool
      is needed to prevent misdiagnosis. Accurate diagnosis is crucial in order to provide
      patients with appropriate treatment.

NCT02404181,Validation of a Delirium Monitor,"
      Delirium is a common disorder in hospitalized patients, nevertheless it is poorly recognized
      by physicians and nurses, even when screening instruments are used. Electroencephalography
      (EEG) appears to be a sensitive tool for the diagnosis of delirium. However, standard EEG
      recording with 25 electrodes is labor intensive. We have previously showed that a brief EEG
      registration with three electrodes and automatic processing can distinguish patients with
      delirium from patients without delirium very well. However, these findings need to be
      validated in an unselected population.

      The primary objective of this validation study is to investigate the sensitivity,
      specificity, and predictive values of the EEG-based delirium monitor (including three
      electrodes and a reference electrode) compared to delirium quantification in frail elderly
      patients after surgery.

      The four purposes of this study are: 1) to examine the feasibility of providing children
      with disabilities to explore the environment with a modified ride-on car; 2) to quantify
      whether children with disabilities are able to have more social interactions with a ride-on
      car; 3) to examine the progression of socialization during the intervention and follow-up
      phases to determine which factors might influence the learning curve; 4) to compare the
      effectiveness of using the modified toy cars through the hospital-based program and regular
      therapy program after intervention and follow-up phases to determine the critical factors on
      increasing independent mobility and socialization, including motivation, treatment executor,
      treatment environment and play programs. It can provide guidelines for the future
      intervention.

      Independent mobility is believed to be essential for perceptual-motor, cognition, language
      and social skill development. It is important to increase the independent mobility in
      children with disabilities and further enhance their development, especially motor and
      socialization. Assistive and power mobility devices allow children with disabilities to move
      independently within their environment and may increase the opportunities to explore and
      interact with people and environment . However, issues to consider before prescribing an
      assistive device include factors such as age, accessibly to community environments, cost,
      social acceptance of the device and the adaptability of the device to growth. This study is
      to use the customized, modified ride-on toy cars, to enhance the independent mobility,
      exploration and socialization through low-cost, family-centered approach. It will also
      improve family's understanding of children's capabilities, which improve their development.
      Investigators will recruit 60 children with who are between 1 to 3 years old and diagnosed
      as motor delay (>1.5 sd). They will be randomly assigned to one of the following two groups:
      hospital-based program group and regular therapy group.

      The whole study duration will be 18 weeks, including 9-week intervention and 9-week
      follow-up; the total amount of treatment will be equal for two groups. The hospital-based
      program will be administered by the therapist and include 120 minutes/per session, 2
      sessions/per week. In addition, the research team will visit the hospital once/per week to
      provide assessments. The regular therapy group will continue their regular therapy without
      any additional car driving training. The research team will visit them once/per week for the
      assessments. The assessments include behavior coding from the videotapes and the clinical
      assessments. The findings of this study will help to understand the feasibility and
      effectiveness of using the low-tech modified toy cars on advancing children's mobility and
      socialization. They can be used in the clinics and are a low cost alternative or addition to
      other mobility devices. They may provide a novel therapeutic tool to improve mobility,

      Currently, two ICU delirium prediction models are available: the PRE-DELIRIC model and the
      early prediction model (E-PRE-DELRIC). However, the use of these prediction models is not
      yet implemented as standard in clinical practice, as it is unknown which delirium prediction
      model can best be used to predict delirium in ICU patients.Therefore the main aim of this

NCT02527499,"The Effects of Combining Modified ride-on Cars With Bimanual Training on Enhancing Mobility, Socialization, Motor Function and Participation in Toddlers With Disabilities","
      The four purposes of this study are: 1) to examine the feasibility of combining modified
      ride-on cars with bimanual training (ROCBT) on mobility, socialization and motor function in
      toddlers with disabilities; 2) to quantify whether toddlers with disabilities are able to
      have more manual explorations and social interactions with ROCBT through observation and
      wrist-worn accelerometers; 3) to determine the critical factors of using the modified
      ride-on toy car on family perceptions and participation.

      Independent mobility is believed to be essential for perceptual-motor, cognition, language
      and social skill development. It is important to increase independent mobility in toddlers
      with disabilities and further enhance their development, especially socialization. Assistive
      and power mobility devices allow toddlers with disabilities to move independently within
      their environment and may increase the opportunities to explore and interact with people and
      environment. However, issues to consider before prescribing an assistive device include
      factors such as age, accessibly to community environments, cost, and social acceptance of
      the device and the adaptability of the device to growth. To address these limitations and
      meet toddlers' needs, the concept of using modified ride-on toy cars in therapy becomes a
      novel application. Study has demonstrated the use of toy cars enhanced a child's motivation,
      socialization and family participation. This study is further to combine the use of
      customized, modified ride-on toy cars with bimanual training, to enhance the independent
      mobility, manual exploration and socialization through low-cost, family-centered approach.
      It will also improve family's understanding of children's capabilities, which improve their
      development.

      Investigators will recruit 75 children with who are between 1 to 3 years old and diagnosed
      as motor delay (>1.5 sd). They will be randomly assigned to one of the following three
      groups: ROCBT treatment group, early mobility training group and regular therapy group. The
      whole study duration will be 18 weeks, including 9-week intervention and 9-week follow-up;
      the total amount of treatment will be equal for two groups. Standardized assessments are
      provided for a total of three times during the study, including the time before and after
      the intervention and in the end of the follow-up phase. The ROCBT and early mobility
      training programs will be administered by the therapist and include 120 minutes/per session,
      2 sessions/per week. The research team will visit the hospital once/per week to provide 60
      minutes videotaping and wearing wrist-worn accelerometers. The regular therapy group will
      continue their regular therapy without any additional car driving training. The research
      team will visit them once/per week for the assessments. The assessments include standardized
      measurements and behavior coding from the videotapes and accelerometers. The findings of
      this study will help to understand the feasibility and effectiveness of combining the
      low-tech modified ride-on cars with bimanual training on advancing children's mobility and
      socialization. They can be used in the clinic or school and are a low cost alternative or
      addition to other mobility devices. They may provide a novel therapeutic tool to improve
      mobility, socialization, family participation and development.

NCT02531542,Evaluation of Rapid Emergency Echography for Acute Dyspnoea,"
      Elderly people constitute the largest proportion of emergency room patients, representing
      12% of all emergency room admissions. The need for diagnostic tests or therapeutic
      interventions is much greater in this patient population. Cardiovascular diseases and
      symptoms represent 12% of the causes for emergency room admission, and patients suffering
      from cardiovascular disease are those whose emergency room visit lasts longest.

      The diagnostic approach in the emergency room in elderly patients admitted for acute
      dypsnoea is complex, and early identification of acute left-sided heart failure (ALSHF) is
      vital as it has an impact on prognosis. The clinical signs are difficult to interpret, and
      are non-specific, particularly at the acute phase and in elderly or obese patients. Indeed,
      some authors have reported up to 50% of diagnostic errors in elderly patients.

      Measure of the blood concentration of a natriuretic peptide allows a quick diagnosis.
      However, peptides suffer from several limitations, particularly in situations that are often
      encountered in elderly patients, such as sepsis, renal failure, acute coronary syndrome,
      pulmonary embolism, chronic respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation and high body mass
      index. Diagnostic performance deteriorates with increasing age, and there is a significant
      increase in this grey-zone in patients aged ≥75 years. In critical situations in elderly
      patients, assessment of natriuretic peptides serve mainly to rule out a diagnosis of left
      heart failure.

      Some authors have suggested using lung ultrasound in the initial work-up of acute
      respiratory failure, since some specific profiles are known to be related to the presence of
      interstitial oedema, reflecting impaired left heart function (e.g. presence of B lines).
      These studies were performed in the context of intensive or critical care, but data are
      sparse regarding the application of this approach in the emergency room.

      The hypothesis is that the diagnostic accuracy of a targeted and quick echographic approach,
      namely the READ method (Rapid Echography for Acute Dyspnoea), comprising targeted lung
      ultrasound combined with isolated measure of transmitral flow, would be superior to that of
      NT-proBNP assessment for the diagnosis of ALSHF in elderly patients (≥75 years) admitted to
      the emergency department.

NCT02577731,Hematopoietic Stem Cell Dysfunction in the Elderly After Severe Injury,"
      Traumatic injury is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in young adults, and remains
      a substantial economic and health care burden. Despite decades of promising preclinical and
      clinical investigations in trauma, investigators understanding of these entities is still
      incomplete, and few therapies have shown success. During severe trauma, bone marrow
      granulocyte stores are rapidly released into the peripheral circulation. This release
      subsequently induces the expansion and repopulation of empty or evacuated space by
      hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Although the patient experiences an early loss of bone
      marrow myeloid-derived cells, stem cell expansion is largely skewed towards the repopulation
      of the myeloid lineage/compartment. The hypothesis is that this 'emergency myelopoiesis' is
      critical for the survival of the severely traumatized and further, failure of the emergency
      myelopoietic response is associated with global immunosuppression and susceptibility to
      secondary infection. Also, identifying the release of myeloid derived suppressor cells
      (MDSCs) in the circulation of human severe trauma subjects. This process is driven by HSCs
      in the bone marrow of trauma subjects. Additionally, MDSCs may have a profound effect on the
      nutritional status of the host. The appearance of these MDSCs after trauma is associated
      with a loss of muscle tissue in these subjects. This muscle loss and possible increased
      catabolism have huge effects on long term outcomes for these subjects. It is the
      investigator's goal to understand the differences that occur in these in HSCs and muscle
      cells as opposed to non-injured and non-infected controls. This work will lead to a better
      understanding of the myelopoietic and catabolic response following trauma.

NCT00044876,"Treatment of Uterine Fibroids With CDB-2914, an Experimental Selective Progesterone Receptor Antagonist","
      Uterine leiomyomata (fibroids) are a common benign tumor of the uterine muscle in
      premenopausal women. These tumors may cause bleeding, pelvic pain and pressure. Because
      fibroids grow in the presence of estrogen, medical therapies that decrease estrogen levels
      (like GnRH analog) cause fibroids to shrink and so may relieve symptoms. However, such
      medication can only be given short-term and has inconvenient side effects such as
      hot-flushes. Thus, many women with symptomatic fibroids choose to have them removed
      surgically, either individually or by removing the uterus via hysterectomy.

      The study evaluates a new medical treatment for fibroids using the progesterone receptor
      modulator CDB-2914. A similar compound, mifepristone (Registered Trademark), reduced fibroid
      size when given for twelve weeks. This study will compare fibroid size, hormone levels and
      symptoms before and during daily administration of CDB-2914 (10 or 25 mg) or placebo for 10
      - 14 weeks. To do this, women will undergo MRI and a saline hysterosonogram (ultrasound with
      fluid) of the uterus before and at the end of the treatment; they will have blood drawn
      every 7 - 14 days, and will fill out a symptom calendar at home. Hysterectomy will be
      performed at the end of the treatment to evaluate the effects of the medication on the
      uterine and fibroid tissues, and to provide treatment for the study participant. Women will

           melanocyte.

        -  Large congenital melanocytic nevi (LCMN) are a special type of mole that begins to grow
           before birth and is larger than moles that develop after birth.

        -  Determining how melanocytes in moles and LCMNs differ from normal melanocytes may
           increase the ability to predict whether a mole will give rise to a melanoma (a type of
           skin cancer)

      Objectives:

        -  To understand how melanomas develop, by studying moles, LCMNs, and pigmented skin
           lesions that are suspicious for melanoma

        -  To develop better criteria for diagnosing melanoma, particularly by using a device
           called a digital dermatoscope (a special camera, connected to a computer, that takes
           pictures of moles when they are magnified and illuminated)

      Eligibility:

        -  Children 5 years old or older with an LCMN

        -  Adults 18 years old or older with 100 or more moles larger than 2 mm in diameter and at
           least one 4 mm or more

        -  Adults 18 years old or older with a pigmented lesion suspicious for melanoma

      Design:

        -  Patients' personal and family health history is obtained.

        -  Patients are examined by investigative team doctors, and several lesions are examined
           with a dermatoscope.

        -  Additional photographs of part or all of the skin surface may be taken.

        -  Some lesions may be biopsied.

      Uterine leiomyomas, commonly called fibroids, are a major health concern for women of
      reproductive age. The objectives of the study described herein are to investigate the growth
      dynamics of uterine leiomyomas in a clinically relevant population of women. We will test
      the hypotheses that uterine leiomyomas are heterogeneous in terms of their growth
      characteristics and in their clinical symptoms or outcomes, and that differences in
      leiomyoma growth dynamics can be discriminated by molecular markers and cellular phenotypes.
      Participants will include 300 premenopausal women (greater than 18 years old) with at least
      one uterine leiomyoma. The inclusion criteria for patient enrollment is confirmed diagnosis
      of leiomyoma by ultrasound. At least one leiomyoma must be equal to or greater than 2 cm in
      diameter and the uterus must be enlarged to the size typical during the eigth week of
      pregnancy. After enrollment and informed consent, T1- and T2-weighted magnetic resonance
      image (MRI) scans will be conducted beginning at the first visit and then at 3, 6, and 12
      months. Each patient will have a physical exam, provide urine and blood samples at each MRI
      visit, and respond to an initial extensive telephone-administered questionnaire followed by
      abbreviated monthly questionnaire updates. A number of the enrolled women will require
      surgical intervention (hysterectomy/myomectomy) as standard care. If surgery is an outcome
      for women enrolled in the study, MRI will be conducted before surgery and the surgical
      pathologist will map uterine leiomyomas for comparison to MRI. Leiomyoma samples will be
      analyzed for histopathological and molecular changes correlated with growth. Because
      hysterectomy and myomectomy are common outcomes in women with leiomyomas, we anticipate
      tissue will be available from at least 100 of the 300 women in the study. For those women
      who opt for surgery, we will also administer a brief (less than 5 minute) questionnaire
      clarifying their reason for electing surgery. Upon completion of data collection, we will be
      able to compare leiomyoma growth as a function of multiplicity and location; examine the
      relationship between leiomyoma growth and clinical symptoms or outcome; identify molecular,
      cellular, and pathological characteristics of leiomyomas with differing growth dynamics; and
      examine endocrinological parameters and lifestyle factors related to differential growth
      dynamics of uterine leiomyomas. The data may be used to establish a clinical severity scale
      and establish diagnostic markers currently not available for uterine leiomyomas.

      percent among people over 40. Results of two previous NIH studies have shown 1-octanol to be
      promising as a potential new treatment. This study will test the effectiveness of 1-octanol
      on essential tremor at doses lower than those given previously.

      Patients 21 years old and older with essential tremor may be eligible for this study.
      Participants are admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for two treatment periods of 1 week
      each, with a 1-week break at home between treatments. Before beginning treatment,
      participants undergo a medical history, physical examination, blood and urine tests, and an
      electrocardiogram (EKG). In addition, tremors are measured using accelerometry, a procedure
      in which a small device, mounted on a piece of cardboard, is taped to the patient's hand for
      about 30 minutes.

      Patients are randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group takes 2 to 4 capsules of
      1-octanol 3 times a day for 1 week, followed by a 1-week ""washout"" period (no treatment),
      and then 2 to 4 capsules of placebo 3 times a day for 1 week. Following the same dosage
      schedule, the second group takes placebo the first week, followed by the washout period and
      then 1-octanol treatment. Blood pressure and pulse are measured at 15, 30, and 60 minutes
      after the first dose of the day and then 3 times a day each day of hospitalization, EKG and
      blood draws are done every other day during hospitalization, and blood is drawn again 1 week
      after the end of the study. Patients evaluate their tremor daily according to a tremor scale
      and are also rated according to an alcohol intoxication scale.

NCT00102596,Clinical Trial Characterizing the Bioavailability of 1-Octanol in Adults With Ethanol-responsive Essential Tremor,"
      OVERVIEW

      Essential tremor (ET) is a common movement disorder affecting 0.4% of the general population
      and up to 14% of people 65 years and older. Response to medications such as beta blockers
      and primidone may be of benefit, but are often accompanied by intolerable side effects.
      Response to ethanol, on the other hand, has a roughly 80% chance of significant tremor
      reduction, though daily use of this as a treatment has potentially serious medical, social,
      and legal consequences.

      The leading hypothesis for ET pathophysiology is an unmasking of spontaneous oscillations
      originating in neurons of the inferior olive. Both ethanol and 1-octanol have been shown to
      reduce these spontaneous oscillations in an animal model of ET; however, 1-octanol does this
      at a dose much lower than that leading to intoxication, suggesting in may be useful in the
      treatment of essential tremor. Our initial studies with 1-octanol have shown it to be safe
      at dosages up to 64mg/kg without signs of intoxication, while at the same time showing
      benefit.

      OBJECTIVE

      We plan to evaluate the efficacy of different 1-octanol formulations in humans based on
      accelerometry and spirography. We will also evaluate drug and metabolite bioavailabilities
      using a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) detection method from plasma and urine
      samples.

      STUDY POPULATION

      We will study adult subjects with ethanol-responsive Essential Tremor (ET).

      DESIGN

      This study is designed as a two-phase unblinded inpatient study of adults with ET receiving
      weight-adjusted oral dosages of 2 different formulations of 1-octanol in a crossover
      fashion. Phase I of the study is designed to develop an octanol detection assay using HPLC.
      Four subjects will receive daily escalating dosages (1-32 mg/kg) of a single 1-octanol
      formulation followed by a crossover trial of both formulations at a dosage of 64 mg/kg.
      Phase II will study 20 subjects receiving one of the two formulations at 64 mg/kg on
      inpatient day 1 followed by a 24 hour period of close monitoring. The second formulation
      will be given on day 3 and the patient will again undergo close monitoring for 24 hours.

      OUTCOME MEASURES

      The primary outcome measures for the study will be efficacy based on tremor ratings from
      accelerometry and spirography. Secondary outcome measures will be the determination of
      bioavailability, pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles of octanol #61864 and octanol
      #68751 and their metabolites.

      IncobotulinumtoxinA (Xeomin) is a botulinum toxin type A preparation free from complexing
      proteins, i.e. free from proteins other than the active toxin. Injected into the muscle,
      incobotulinumtoxinA (Xeomin) causes local weakening. Botulinum toxin type A is widely used
      for treatment of various neurological conditions. This study will investigate the efficacy
      and safety of incobotulinumtoxinA (Xeomin) in the treatment of post-stroke spasticity of the

NCT00462449,Efficacy of Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) in Persons Receiving Botulinum Neurotoxin for Upper Extremity Spasticity,"
      FES is a form of treatment with a device to aid movement in people who have had damage to
      their brain or spinal cord. Small electrical impulses are used to excite/stimulate the
      nerves that supply paralyzed muscles. This activates those muscles, enabling them to produce
      basic but useful movement. Self-adhesive patches (electrodes) are placed on the skin close
      to the nerve that supplies the muscle and are connected by wires to a stimulator that
      produces the impulses. In this way, FES is used to correct the muscle weakness that is
      caused by injury to the brain or spinal cord.

      Repetitive task practice is an ""activity-based"" therapy program that has been shown to
      enhance the recovery of hand and arm functions after stroke. This therapy consists of a set
      of training activities that are designed by a qualified therapist specific to your
      functional abilities that are to be performed with the impaired hand. These activities are
      designed to stimulate functional improvement with repetitive practice.

      Spasticity is a nervous system disorder where certain muscles are continuously contracted.
      Botox injections are commonly used to help to reduce spasticity in areas of the body with
      increased muscle tone. This research is designed to look at any additional benefit that may
      occur when Botox injections are combined with specific occupational therapy exercises and
      with a device that uses functional electrical stimulation (FES) to help improve muscle
      function after stroke.

NCT00565201,Evaluation of BOTOX® With Rehabilitation Therapy for the Treatment of Wrist and Hand Spasticity in Post-Stroke Patients,"
      The present study is designed to determine the safety and effectiveness of injections of
      BOTOX® in spastic muscles of the arm and hand compared with injections of saline (which
      would do nothing) when combined with rehabilitation therapy for the improvement of active
      function tasks in post-stroke patients. Injections will be targeted to reduce common
      spasticity patterns of the arm and hand which include: bent elbow, palm down forearm, bent
      wrist, thumb-in-palm, clenched fist, and other hand deformities. This will be done only at
      Emory University. Neither the doctor injecting the drug nor the subject receiving the drug
      will know if they are getting BOTOX® or saline. Which type of injection the subject receives
      will be completely randomized (like flipping a coin). All subjects will have rehabilitation
      therapy after their injections. Subjects will be assessed at a total of 5 scheduled visits
      (qualification (Week 1), Injection (Week 2), Evaluations on Weeks 8, 10, and 14. All
      subjects will receive rehabilitation therapy immediately after their injections for 1 hour a
      day, 3-5 times a week, for 4 weeks. The results from this project will provide valuable data
      on the ability of BOTOX® and physical rehabilitation to provide effective treatment to
      spastic muscles of the arm and hand after stroke. This project has the potential to increase
      the availability of effective rehabilitation techniques to patients with stroke.

      Background. The World Health Organization recommends pre-exposure vaccination (PreP) to
      protect children living in canine rabies endemic countries. Including PreP in national
      childhood immunization programs (EPI) is a viable option.

      Methods. In an open-label phase II clinical trial, 200 healthy toddlers were randomized to
      receive Purified Chick Embryo Cell Vaccine (PCECV) in a 3-dose Full-IM (1mL), Half-IM
      (0.5mL), 3-ID (0.1mL), or a 2-dose 2-ID (0.1mL) regimen, all in combination with two doses
      of Japanese Encephalitis (JEV), or JEV alone. One booster dose of PCECV (IM or ID) and JEV,
      or JEV alone was administered concomitantly one year after primary vaccination. Safety was
      evaluated after each injection. Blood was drawn on days 0 and 49, one year later prior to
      booster and on days 7 and 28 post-booster, and at two and three years post primary
      vaccination. All sera were analyzed for rabies and JE virus neutralizing antibodies (RVNA,

NCT00740090,Malaria Vaccine for Children in Mali,"
      This study will evaluate the safety and immune response of children to an experimental
      malaria vaccine called AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel® (Registered Trademark) + CPG 7909. Malaria is an
      infection of red blood cells caused by a parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, that is spread by
      certain kinds of mosquitoes. It affects at least 300 million people worldwide each year,
      with more than 1 million deaths, mostly among children less than 5 years of age in
      sub-Saharan Africa. Malaria is the leading cause of death and illness among the general
      population of Mali in West Africa. Increasing drug resistance to P. falciparum and
      widespread resistance of mosquitoes to pesticides are reducing the ability to control the
      disease through these strategies. AMA1 C1 is made from a synthetic protein similar to a P.
      falciparum protein. It is combined with Alhydrogel and CPG 7909, substances added to
      vaccines to make them work better.

      Children between 1 and 4 years of age who live in Bancoumana, Mali, and are in general good
      health may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history,
      physical examination, and blood and urine tests.

      Participants are randomly assigned to receive three injections (shots) of either AMA1-C1 or
      a control rabies inactivated vaccine called Imovax® (Registered Trademark). The shots are
      given in the thigh muscle on study days 0, 56 and 180. After each shot, participants are
      observed in the clinic for 30 minutes. They return to the clinic for a physical examination
      six or seven times between each shot and then four more times over a 9-month period after
      the last shot. Blood samples are drawn at several of these visits to check for side effects
      of the vaccine and to measure the response to it. The total duration of the study is 21

NCT01025726,Positive Action for Today's Health,"
      Regular moderate and vigorous intensity physical activity (PA) is inversely related with
      obesity, however, few adults are successful in incorporating sufficient PA into their daily
      lives. Minority and lower-income adults have among the highest obesity rates and lowest
      levels of regular PA. Increasing environmental supports for safe and convenient places for
      PA is an emerging public health strategy for PA interventions. Preliminary data by Wilson
      (PI) and colleagues has revealed through focus groups that low-income minority adults would
      like to increase the safe places for PA (areas free from crime, containment of stray dogs,
      increased police patrol) and access to PA (sidewalks/trails and expand opportunities for PA)
      in their community. In addition, the results of the investigators' preliminary studies
      suggest that African Americans had psychosocial barriers to PA that included lack of
      self-motivation, cultural body image issues, and lack of time due to family obligations. The
      present proposal is innovative in that it specifically tests the efficacy of an intervention
      that includes both patrolled-walking and social marketing elements to increase PA in
      low-income African Americans. Three communities will be randomized to receive one of three
      programs: a police patrolled-walking program plus social marketing intervention, a police
      patrolled-walking only intervention, or no walking intervention (general health education
      only; N=390; 130/group). The 24-month intervention will focus on increasing safety (training
      community leaders to serve as walking captains, hiring off-duty police officers to patrol
      the walking program, and containing stray dogs), increasing access for PA (marking a walking
      route), and will include a tailored social marketing campaign for increasing PA (in one
      intervention community). The investigators will collect data for PA (7-day accelerometer
      estimates, 4-week PA history), body composition, blood pressure, psychosocial measures, and
      perceptions of environmental supports for safety and access for PA at baseline, 6-,12-,18-,
      and 24-months. The primary hypotheses are that the patrolled-walking plus social marketing
      intervention will result in greater increases in moderate and vigorous PA as compared to a
      patrolled walking only intervention or no-intervention by 12-months and that these effects
      will be maintained at 18-month and 24-month assessments.

      Robotic assistance during thyroid surgery has been utilized clinically in Korea since late
      2007. Robotic thyroidectomy has also been validated for surgical management of the thyroid
      gland. Compared with endoscopic thyroidectomy, the use of a robot in an endoscopic approach
      via the axilla provides a broader view of the thyroid bed, albeit from a lateral, as opposed
      to the conventional anterior, perspective. The wrist action of a surgical robot also
      provides a greater degree of movement than afforded by the use of simple endoscopic
      instruments, and tremor is eliminated.

      Although several reports on operative outcomes of the robotic technique have appeared, no
      prospective trials comparing the clinical results of robotic with conventional open

NCT01388400,Enriched Environments for Upper Limb Stroke Rehabilitation,"
      Stroke contributes significantly to the incidence of disabilities, with upper limb (UL)
      motor impairment being especially prevalent. Animal studies suggest that post-stroke motor
      recovery is largely attributable to adaptive plasticity in brain motor areas. While some
      environmental training factors contributing to plastic mechanisms have been identified in
      animals, translation of this knowledge to the clinical setting is insufficient. Optimal
      recovery may be related to both external (e.g., feedback type) and internal factors (e.g.,
      cognitive ability, motivation). Clinically feasible methods for training are needed. Use of
      enriched virtual environments (VEs) may provide a way to address these needs. Outcome
      measures that best reflect recovery need to be identified since this is an essential step to
      evaluate the effect of novel training programs for UL motor recovery in stroke.

      The research question is which clinical and kinematic outcome measures best reflect motor
      performance recovery after a targeted upper limb treatment intervention. Aim 1 is to compare
      changes in outcome measures recorded before and after an upper limb intervention in stroke
      subjects to motor performance in healthy subjects. Aim 2 is to determine motor performance
      between-group differences sample size is based on knowledge of expected outcome measure mean
      score differences between groups. Hypothesis. 1: Specific clinical and kinematic outcome
      measures will be sensitive to within-group (pre-post intervention training) changes.
      Hypothesis. 2: Specific clinical and kinematic outcome measures will be sensitive to
      between-group (healthy vs. patients in enriched vs. conventional intervention groups.
      Sixteen chronic stroke survivors and 8 age- and sex-matched healthy controls will
      participate. Patients will be matched on cognitive and motor impairment levels and divided
      into two groups. Using an single subject (A-B-A) research design, kinematics during two
      pre-tests, 3 weeks apart, will be recorded for test-retest reliability. Stroke groups will
      practice varied upper limb reaching movements (15 45-minute sessions in 3 weeks) in
      environments providing different motivation/feedback levels. Pre- and post motor performance
      evaluations will be done with clinical tests and a Test Task with specific motor performance
      requirements. A Transfer Task will also be recorded. By comparing data analysis methods
      (3-Dimensional (3D) analysis of different markers or placements), the investigators will
      identify which kinematic outcome measures best reflect motor improvement in post-test and
      follow-up sessions (retention).

      The expected results are identification of two primary and two secondary outcome measures
      that reflect upper limb motor recovery and can distinguish between motor recovery and
      compensation. The results will be used to design a randomized control trial to determine the
      efficacy of VE-based treatment on arm motor recovery. The goal is to determine how extrinsic
      (environmental) and intrinsic (personal) motivational factors affect motor learning in
      stroke survivors with cognitive and physical impairment. Knowledge gained can also be used
      for rehabilitation of other neurological and orthopedic pathologies.

      in these populations, and also shows impressive immunogenicity, not significantly different
      to that seen in the UK trials where efficacy was shown. In particular, recent data from The
      Gambia shows excellent safety and immunogenicity in infants in malaria endemic areas, who
      would be the ones to benefit most from such a vaccine against malaria. With this clinical
      development as background, the investigators now propose to evaluate efficacy against
      natural malaria infection in this important target group for an effective malaria vaccine,
      that is, 5-17 month infants and children living in malaria endemic areas. The proposed study
      area, Banfora, Burkina Faso, is highly endemic for Plasmodium falciparum malaria.

NCT01683838,Safety and Efficacy of Oral Fampridine-Sustained Release (SR) for the Treatment of Spasticity Resulting From Spinal Cord Injury,"
      Normally, nerve fibers carry electrical impulses through the spinal cord, providing
      communication between the brain and the arms and legs. In people with spinal cord injury,
      some fibers may be destroyed at the site of injury, while others remain connected but do not
      work correctly to carry electrical impulses. As a result, subjects with an incomplete spinal
      cord injury may have spasticity which is muscle spasms or muscle stiffness that makes
      movement difficult. Fampridine-SR is an experimental drug that increases the ability of the
      nerve to conduct electrical impulses. This study will examine the effects of Fampridine-SR
      on moderate to severe lower-limb spasticity, as well as the effects on bodily functions such
      as bladder control, bowel function and sexual function. The study will also examine the
      possible risks of taking Fampridine-SR.

NCT01767480,Effects of Intensive Robot-assisted Therapy in Patients With Subacute Stroke,"
      Robot-assisted training (RT) devices developed to date have a significant impact on stroke
      rehabilitation. Several research groups have developed the robotic devices and examined
      their efficacy on improving upper limb function after stroke. All these robotic devices have
      been applied in stroke rehabilitation and their efficacy are evaluated, but the scientific
      evidence for the mechanisms of RT-induced recovery, the optimal treatment intensity, and the
      impact on physiological responses is still lacking.

      This trial is to examine (1) the immediate effects of treatment intensity in RT on
      sensorimotor impairments and functional performance in patients with subacute stroke; (2)
      the long-term benefits of treatment intensity in RT by conducting a 6-month follow up
      evaluation; and (3) the effects of RT on cortical/movement reorganization as well as on the
      physiological markers of inflammation, oxidative stress, and erythrocyte deformability.
      These overall findings will help better understanding of the efficacy of RT on functional
      outcomes, brain and movement reorganization, and physiological markers.

NCT02122159,Research With Retinal Cells Derived From Stem Cells for Myopic Macular Degeneration,"
      Pathologic myopia is a major cause of legal blindness worldwide. In myopic macular
      degeneration (MMD), there is degeneration of the retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) layer, and
      associated photoreceptors, resulting in vision loss. There is currently no standard
      treatment for MMD.

      Transplantation of intact sheets of RPE and suspensions of isolated individual RPE cells as
      well as autologous translocation of RPE cells has been attempted as treatment for AMD. Human
      photoreceptors are comprised of two cell types-rods and cones. Both have a close
      relationship with the outermost retinal cells, the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE). The
      RPE is located between the choroid and the photoreceptors. The RPE maintains photoreceptor
      function by recycling photopigments,delivering, metabolizing and storing vitamin A,
      phagocytosing rod photoreceptor outer segments, transporting iron and small molecules
      between retina and choroid, maintaining Bruch's membrane and absorbing stray light to allow
      better image resolution. In essence, the RPE layer is critical to the function and health of
      photoreceptors and the retina as a whole.

      Human PRE (hRPE) transplantation may be a viable option for treatment of degenerative
      diseases of the retina.

      MA09-hRPE cells are fully differentiated human RPE cells derived from embryonic stem cells.
      Transplanted hRPE cells prepared by Advanced Cell Technology have been studied in rodent
      models of macular degenerative disease. The data suggests that the subretinal injection of
      ACT's hRPE cell products rescues, or at least delays, loss of visual function in two animal
      models of retinal degenerative diseases.

      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of MA09-hRPE
      cellular therapy in patients with Myopic Macular Degeneration (MMD). Another objective is to
      evaluate potential efficacy endpoints to be used in future studies of RPE cellular therapy.

NCT02359812,Robot Aided Rehabilitation - Multi-point Evaluations,"
      Sensorimotor impairments following stroke can lead to substantial disability involving the
      upper extremity. These impairments often involve complex pathological changes across
      multiple joints and multiple degrees-of-freedom (MJMD) of the arm and hand, thereby
      rendering them difficult to diagnose and to treat. Many potential mechanisms, such as
      weakness, motoneuronal hyperexcitability, and elevated passive impedance, can contribute to
      the impairment, thereby making it difficult to discern where best to focus treatment. The
      objectives of this study are to quantify the progression of neuromechanical properties
      throughout the upper extremity during recovery from stroke.

      The aim of this study is to examine neuromechanical properties throughout the entire upper
      extremity in stroke survivors over a period of 6 months and throughout the progression from
      the acute to the subacute to the chronic phases of recovery. The researchers hypothesize
      that excessive local and cross-coupled stiffness, heteronymous reflexes, and diminished
      individuation and proprioceptive acuity will be present among multiple DOFs in the upper
      limb. The stiffness and spasticity will increase with time post-stroke.

NCT02427854,Palestinian Perineum and Birth Complication Study,"
      In this study the investigators want to assess complications associated to pregnancy and
      delivery, and interventions used during labor.

      Pregnancy and delivery related complications are a major health problem globally. Events
      during labor such as excessive bleeding, uterine rupture, emergency cesarean delivery; other
      instrumental deliveries and anesthesia problems are situations that potentially may lead to
      severe outcomes for the mother and child.

      Diabetes, anemia and hypertensive disorders may also complicate both the pregnancy and
      delivery.

      Between 60-80% of women delivering their first baby need suturing due to perineal tears
      (tears located to the area between the vagina and anus). Superficial perineal tears rarely
      cause long-term problems, but often lead to pain and discomfort immediately after birth.
      Deeper or severe perineal tears, involving the anal sphincter, may influence the woman's
      quality of life. This is mainly due to long-lasting pain, discomfort and sexual dysfunction,
      and the fact that obstetric anal sphincter tear is the main cause of anal incontinence.
      Recent clinical intervention studies have shown that the incidence of severe obstetric
      perineal tears may be reduced by 50-70% by introducing a bimanual support technique of the
      perineum. In these studies all midwives and gynecologists were trained in the bimanual
      support technique. When it comes to training in new medical techniques in general, some
      studies have shown that use of animated instructions on mobile phones may be a good
      alternative to the more traditional ""hands-on"" or ""bedside"" teaching methods. In a global

      Background:

      Tennis elbow, also known as lateral epicondylitis, is the inflammatory status of insertion
      site of common extensor tendon to humerus. It is usually related to overuse of local muscle.
      Radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy (rESWT) is a non-invasive physical treatment. It
      applies shockwave energy to the lesion site, enhancing the growth of microvascularity,
      inducing tissue repair, and thus relieving the symptom.

      The purpose of this study is to understand the therapeutic effect of rESWT to tennis elbow.

      Material and Methods

        -  Methods: The patients will be randomly divided into the experimental group and the
           control group through the draw, with 15 patients in each group. Patients in the
           experimental group receive rESWT plus routine rehabilitation program. Patients in the
           control group receive sham shockwave therapy plus routine rehabilitation program.

        -  Assessment: Before the therapy starts, patients who match the inclusion criteria will
           be evaluated using tools mentioned below:

        -  General data: age, sex, body height, body weight, affected side, medical history

        -  Assess upper extremity function and symptom with Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and

      immunodeficiency disorders (inherited diseases of the immune system) and evaluate the course
      of these diseases in patients over time to learn more about the medical problems they cause.
      The immune system is composed of various cells (e.g., T and B cells and phagocytes) and
      other substances (complement system) that protect the body from infections and cancer.
      Abnormalities in the gene(s) responsible for the function of these components can lead to
      serious infections and other immune problems.

      Patients with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency, Janus
      Associated Kinase 3 (JAK3) deficiency, common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) and other
      immunodeficiencies may be eligible for this study. Participants will undergo a medical and
      family history, physical examination, and additional procedures and tests that may include
      the following:

        3. Skin tests to assess response to antigens such as the viruses and bacteria responsible
           for tetanus, candida, tuberculosis, diphtheria, chicken pox, and other diseases.

        4. Skin and lymph node biopsies for tissue and DNA studies

        5. Chest X-ray, CT scans, or both to look for cancer or various infections.

        6. Pulmonary function test to assess lung capacity and a breath test to test for H. pylori
           infection.

        7. Dental, skin and eye examinations.

        8. Treatment with intravenous immunoglobulins or antibodies to prevent infections.

        9. Apheresis for collecting white blood cells to study cell function. In this procedure,
           whole blood is collected through a needle placed in an arm vein. The blood circulates
           through a machine that separates it into its components. The white cells are then
           removed, and the red cells, platelets and plasma are returned to the body, either
           through the same needle or through a second needle placed in the other arm.

       10. Bone marrow sampling to study the disease. A small amount of marrow from the hipbone is
           drawn (aspirated) through a needle. The procedure can be done under local anesthesia or
           light sedation.

       11. Placental and umbilical cord blood studies, if cord blood is available, to study stem
           cells (cells that form blood cells).

      Information gained from this study may provide a better understanding of primary

      Patients between 18 and 75 years of age with CVID and chronic diarrhea or involuntary weight
      loss of more than 5 percent of their past body weight over the past 12 months may be
      eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a review of their medical records, a
      medical history and physical examination, blood, urine and stool tests, chest x-rays and
      skin test for exposure to tuberculosis, and a hydrogen breath test. For the latter, breath
      samples are collected before and every 20 minutes (for 2 hours) after the subject drinks a
      sugar solution. This test determines the digestive effects of bacteria in the upper
      intestine. Samples are collected by having the subject blow into a balloon.

      Participants undergo the following tests and procedures:

      Immune System and Gastrointestinal Evaluation

        -  48-hour stool fat collection (measures the amount of undigested fat in the stool):
           Subjects keep a diary of what they eat for a 48-hour period. At the beginning of the 48
           hours they take two dye capsules and then take another two capsules 48 hours later.
           They collect a stool sample when they pass the second set of capsules in their bowel
           movement. An additional 24-hour stool collection is tested for loss of protein in the
           stool.

        -  D-xylose absorption test (measures the ability of the gut to absorb nutrients):
           Subjects drink a solution of d-xylose (a sugar substitute). Blood samples are collected
           before and 1 hour after drinking the solution.

      This study investigates gene abnormalities in Primary Immune Deficiency(PID) with a goal of
      improving the diagnosis and treatment of patients.

      The specific disorders include:

        1. X linked hyper IgM Syndrome which is caused by an abnormality in the CD40L gene.

        2. NEMO associated immune deficiency which is caused by an abnormality in a gene called
           NEMO.

        3. Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) which has an unknown genetic basis.

        4. Other disorders of immunoglobulin production.

      This study will:

        1. Better characterize the clinical features of CD40 L deficiency and NEMO associated
           immune deficiency and other related primary immune deficiency syndromes.

        2. Determine the frequency of CD40 L and Nemo abnormalities.

        3. Determine whether particular abnormalities in these genes are associated with more of
           less severe illness or with specific symptoms.

        4. Explore the basic mechanism by which these altered genes cause immune dysfunction.

        5. Identify other genes causing low immune globulin levels and related primary immune
           deficient states.

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fluorouracil, cisplatin, oxaliplatin, and
      gemcitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the
      cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination
      chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill
      tumor cells. It is not yet known whether giving fluorouracil and cisplatin together with
      radiation therapy is more effective than giving gemcitabine together with oxaliplatin in
      treating nonmetastatic biliary tract cancer.

NCT00526188,Efficacy and Safety of Primovist in Chinese Patients,"
      Participants who had been diagnosed or suspected by doctors to have focal liver lesions that
      need further evaluation in order to make an accurate diagnosis. Participants would need to
      have an enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan so that doctors could have further
      information about the number and characteristics of the focal liver lesions.

      Participants were invited to take part in this clinical study. The purpose of this study was
      to evaluate Primovist, which is a liver-specific MRI contrast medium, on the efficacy of
      lesion detection and characterization, and tolerability in Chinese patients with known or
      suspected focal liver lesions.

      Primovist, the investigational drug in this study, is a liver-specific MRI contrast medium
      developed by Bayer Schering Pharma AG. Its active substance is Gd-EOB-DTPA. Primovist was
      first approved in 2004 in Sweden followed by an approval in the European community, in
      Switzerland and Australia in the same year.

      Procedures:

      Before entry into the study and after entry of the study a physical examination was
      conducted, blood pressure and heart rate were measured, blood and urine samples were taken.
      Current medications and medical conditions (including suspected pregnancy) and medical and
      surgical history were elicited by doctors.

      After entry into the study, participants were scheduled to have an MRI examination, which
      lasted about 25-35 minutes.

      During the MRI examination, an initial MRI scan without contrast was acquired which followed
      by another MRI series after the intravenous administration of Primovist.

      The following day participants were asked to return to the hospital for a follow-up safety
      evaluation.

      Possible Benefit Participants were scheduled to receive an enhanced magnetic resonance
      imaging scan. Clinical studies indicated that Primovist increased the efficacy of detection
      and characterization of focal liver lesions by providing better contrast between the focal
      liver lesions and surrounding normal tissue. Primovist were shown to provide additional
      information regarding existence, number and characterization (lesion or non-lesion,
      malignant or benign) of these abnormalities.

      Based on the experience with patients given Primovist, some adverse reactions were observed.

      Most of undesirable effects were transient and of mild to moderate intensity. The most
      commonly noted adverse events (AEs) in subjects receiving Primovist for MRI were nausea and
      headache with an incidence of 1.1%. Other AEs that occurred in 0.5% of the subject
      population were feeling hot (0.8%), back pain (0.6%) and dizziness (0.5%).

      All other AEs occurred in less than 0.5% of the patients, e.g. anxiety; coughing; eye
      disorder; fever; flatulence; generalized spasm; hypertension; injection site symptoms
      including edema, inflammation, and reaction; lightheadedness; parosmia; postural
      hypotension; taste perversion, motoric unrest; acute respiratory distress; fatigue; malaise;
      vomiting; palpitations, erythema, chest pain and back pain.

      Coldness, warmth or pain at the injection site, injection site reaction, and injection site
      accumulation of fluid were rare. In very rare cases strong allergy-like reactions ranging to
      shock may occur.

      Post-marketing tachycardia and restlessness have been reported. As in the case of other
      investigational drugs, there may also be unforeseen side effects.

      Additional information concerning all Gadolinium- based contrast agents Primovist contains
      the rare earth metal gadolinium as active ingredient. There have been reports of nephrogenic
      systemic fibrosis (NSF) associated with use of some gadolinium-containing contrast agents
      (especially Omniscan) in patients with severe renal impairment. NSF is a systemic disease
      characterised by formation of connective tissue in the skin, which becomes thickened and
      hard, sometimes leading to contractures and joint immobility. The clinical course is usually
      progressive and currently no treatment is available. To date NSF has only been reported in
      association with some Gd-containing contrast agents, but the role of these contrast agents
      in the overall pathogenesis of the disease is still not completely understood.

      No reports of patients with NSF after administration of Primovist® are known. The risk to
      trigger NSF in risk patients with severe renal impairment is considered to be low for
      Primovist® due to the low dose given and the additional excretion via feces. Furthermore the
      participation of patients with severe renal impairment are excluded from this study.

      In case the participants were suffering from renal insufficiency, they were told to tell
      their doctors prior to application of the contrast agent. In case the participants
      experienced any new alterations of the skin following the administration of the contrast
      agent, they were told to contact their doctors as soon as possible after they had recognized
      these symptoms.

      Aim:

      The general aim of this research group is to improve the recovery of patients after
      abdominal surgery. The specific aim of this study is to conduct a randomized, double
      blinded, controlled trial to investigate the effect of intra-peritoneal local anaesthesia
      application on postoperative pain and post-operative fatigue. This will be conducted in the
      setting of an enhanced recovery after surgery program (ERAS).

      Methods:

      Patients will be randomised by computer generated random numbers and opaque envelope method.
      In the treatment arm patients will receive 10ml 0.75% ropivacaine diluted to 50mls with 0.9%
      saline soon after the creation of the laparotomy . In the placebo arm, 50mls of 0.9% normal
      saline will be used in a similar fashion. At closure, two small 2mm catheter belonging to
      the On-Q pain buster system will be placed in the peritoneal cavity. This will be attached
      to a pump which will contain either a 0.2% ropivacaine solution or 0.9% saline placebo
      running at 4mls/hr for 68 hours. All members involved in patient care (with the exception of
      one nurse) will be blinded to the above. After 68 hours the pump will be stopped and the
      catheter will be removed. Assessment of postoperative pain will be performed by visual
      analogue scale, and fatigue assessment will be done using the Identity Consequence Fatigue
      Scale (ICFS) at various intervals post-operatively. Blood tests for inflammatory markers
      including glucose, cortisol, CRP, albumin and several cytokines as well as local anaesthetic
      levels will be taken.

      Significance to health:

      This method of analgesia administration has not been investigated in open major colonic
      surgery. This trial has wide reaching implications, with the potential to improve pain and
      thus recovery after abdominal surgery.

      Liver disease is a common medical problem in Saudi Arabia. Early studies indicated that
      around 10% of the Saudi population is either infected with hepatitis B or C. An estimated
      12% of chronic HCV and HBV patients undergoing liver biopsy from Saudi centers have
      cirrhosis. Of these 3-5% would decompensate yearly thereby requiring liver transplantation.
      Based on the most recent national census figures, and a 1-2% prevalence rate of HBV and HCV
      nationwide, an estimated 1,000 patients would require liver transplantation on a yearly
      basis for decompensated cirrhosis.

      Liver transplantation is the only available life saving treatment for patients with end
      stage liver disease. Unfortunately less than 100 liver transplantations are performed in
      Saudi Arabia in three centers. Around 100 other patients travel abroad for transplantation
      annually while all other patients progressively deteriorate and eventually die from the
      complications of decompensated liver cirrhosis.

      In addition, even in patients who are listed for liver transplantation, often patients are
      too sick to wait on the transplant list that often takes more than a year and the on-list
      mortality is high. A procedure or an intervention that may help to stabilize liver function
      in order to help patients survive on the transplant list while awaiting liver
      transplantation would be of immense benefit. Examples of such interventions are already
      approved and used in some centers like the MARS system.

NCT01627119,The Functional and Clinicopathological Roles and Therapeutic Implication of Connective Tissue Growth Factor in Peritoneal Metastasis of Gastric Cancer,"
      For the past 50 years, gastric cancer has been one of the ten most frequent cancers and the
      second leading cause of cancer-related death in the world. In Taiwan, it is the fifth most
      common cause of cancer-related deaths, accounting for 6.3% of all cancer deaths. The poor
      prognosis of gastric cancer is mostly caused by the extensive metastasis to the lymph nodes,
      liver, and peritoneal dissemination even if curative resection was performed. The main cause
      of recurrence after curative or noncurative resection of advanced tumors is peritoneal
      metastasis because of possible direct spillage and dissemination of tumor cells as a result
      of surgical manipulation, and it is associated with a poor prognosis. As yet, no effective
      treatment has been developed for this condition. The development of peritoneal metastasis is
      a multistep process, beginning with attachment to peritoneal mesothelial cells, retraction
      of the mesothelial cells and exposure of the basement membrane, attachment to the basement
      membrane, degradation in the extracellular matrix, proliferation by the cancer cells, and
      angiogenesis, and it is clear that many types of agents are involved at the various stages
      of this process. Developing a new therapeutic method for this mode of metastasis is very
      important for improvement of gastric cancer treatment.

      discovered members: cysteine-rich61, CTGF, and nephroblastoma-overexpressed gene). It is a
      multifunctional growth factor involved in wound healing, inflammation, cell adhesion,
      chemotaxis, apoptosis, tumor growth, and fibrosis. Recent studies showed that overexpression
      of CTGF in human oral squamous cell carcinoma reduces cell growth and tumorigenecity.
      Similar tumor growth inhibitory effects were observed in lung cancer cells in which CTGF
      overexpression was less angiogenic and metastatic due to blocking of the VEGF A signaling
      pathway. CTGF was also reported to be a key regulator of colorectal cancer invasion and
      metastasis, and it appears to be a better prognostic factor. These studies suggest that CTGF
      may involve the processes of peritoneal metastasis which includes cancer cell adhesion in
      peritoneum, proliferation and angiogenesis. Peritoneal mesothelium is the first surface
      encountered by disseminated tumor cells and successful adhesion is, therefore, of paramount
      importance in metastasis formation. Therefore, we hypothesized that CTGF is a potential
      molecule target, which may be related to cell adhesion to peritoneum, the first step of
      peritoneal metastasis, and its exact mechanism may includes proliferation and angiogenesis.

      In order to answer these important questions, first, we have performed the preliminary
      studies to prove CTGF did express in different gastric cancer cell lines including AGS, N87,
      TSGH, and MKN-45 by using RT-PCR and Western blotting, and gastric cancer tissues by using
      immunohistochemical method. Second, we demonstrated different levels of CTGF expression in
      different cell lines pose different adhesion ability in in-vitro adhesion assay. Third, we
      conducted a transient CTGF-overexpressed MKN45 gastric cancer cell line, and
      CTGF-overexpressed cell line had lower adhesive ability compared to the control.

      Next step in this project, we will be studying the roles of CTGF plays in cellular and
      molecular biology in vitro and in vivo and clinical significance associated with therapeutic
      potential of peritoneal metastasis from gastric cancer. We will generate stable clones of
      MKN45 cells harboring CTGF and its control cell line to elucidate the roles of CTGF in
      cancer cell adhesion, proliferation and angiogenesis in peritoneum.

NCT01851460,Radiofrequency Ablation for Liver Abscesses From Chronic Granulomatous Disease,"
      Background:

      - Abscesses are a pocket of infection in an organ or tissue. Patients with a disease called
      chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) often develop these abscesses. CGD is an inherited
      disorder that affects how white blood cells function. Liver abscesses in people with CGD
      often require surgery to remove them and treat the infection. However, some people with CGD
      cannot have full surgery because it would be too risky. Researchers want to try a procedure
      called radiofrequency ablation (RFA) to treat these liver abscesses. RFA can usually be done
      without a major operation. This study will see if RFA is a safe and effective treatment for
      liver abscesses in patients with CGD.

      Objectives:

      - To see if RFA is a safe and effective treatment for CGD-related liver abscesses.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals between 18 and 75 years of age with CGD who have liver abscesses that cannot
      be treated with surgery.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine
           samples will be collected. Imaging studies will be performed on the liver.

        -  Participants will have RFA for the abscesses. RFA is an image-guided technique that
           heats and destroys specific tissue, such as tumor tissue. It will target any abscesses
           on the liver.

        -  After the procedure, participants will stay in the hospital for monitoring before being
           released.

        -  Participants will have regular follow-up visits for up to 1 year after treatment. Blood
           and urine samples will be collected. Additional imaging studies will be performed.

NCT02048319,Efficacy of Combining Pasireotide With Aspiration Sclerotherapy to Improve Volume Reduction of Hepatic Cysts,"
      Liver cysts are fluid filled cavities located in the liver. They are present in 2-11% of the
      general population, typically not causing any symptoms or complications. However, in a small
      subset of patients complaints of pain, abdominal fullness and distension, dyspnea and nausea
      occur.

      Currently, aspiration and sclerotherapy is a treatment of choice in symptomatic patients
      with a large dominant liver cyst. However, studies reported early fluid reaccumulation and
      relative high recurrence rates of cyst growth after aspiration sclerotherapy ultimately
      leading to re-interventions. In this respect, somatostatin analogues are promising agents
      known for its volume reducing effect in patients with polycystic liver disease.

      In this study the investigators want to evaluate the effect of combining aspiration
      sclerotherapy with the multi-receptor binding, long-acting somatostatin analogue
      Pasireotide.

      The investigators hypothesize that administrating pasireotide before and after aspiration
      sclerotherapy could prevent early fluid reaccumulation and thereby result in a greater
      reduction of cyst diameter. Moreover, the investigators expect a lower rate of cyst
      recurrence and subsequently lower need for re-interventions.

NCT02085564,Significance of Peritoneal Washing Cytology Before and After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Patients With Esophagogastric-junction Cancer,"
      Background:

      The prevalence of gastroesophageal-junction cancer (cancer between the distal part of the
      oesophagus, and proximal part of the stomach/GEJ-cancer) is increasing in Denmark with more
      than 400 patients per year. The 5-year overall survival is less than 10% for the 2/3 of the
      patients, which are not considered resectable. Even for the 1/3, which is treated with
      surgical intervention and neoadjuvant chemotherapy the overall-survival is approximately
      30%.

      The current Danish intended curative treatment consists of esophagectomy (surgical resection
      of the oesophagus with extended lymphadenectomy in abdomen and thorax (removal of
      lymphnodes)). Furthermore, perioperative chemotherapy consists of 6 series neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy (3 series before, and 3 series after operation).

      Unresectable patients receive palliative chemotherapy and no resection. Peritoneal washing
      cytology (PWC) is a recommended prediagnostic modality in gastric cancer patients. The
      method is used to detect free peritoneal cancer cells in the abdominal cavity even when
      macroscopic carcinomatosis is not present (i.e. the cancer has spread to other parts of the
      abdomen).

      Carcinomatosis can be found in up to 19% in gastric cancer patients often in the peritoneum.
      Positive peritoneal cytology (C1) can be identified in up to 7% of gastric cancer patients
      without metastases (C1M0), i.e. malignant cells can be identified in the peritoneal washing,
      but tumor spread has not been identified.

      Lots of studies indicate that C1-disease is an independent prognostic predictor for
      decreased survival, and increased recurrence rate, comparable with M1 patients (i.e.
      patients with distant metastases).

      The American Joint Committee on cancer recommends that C1 patients should be treated
      non-surgically - even when M1 disease has not been identified.

      On the basis of the above, PWC can be used to identify patients at greater risk for
      recurrence, and thereby not candidates for intended curative treatment.

      It is a fact, though, that C1M0 patients have a better survival than C1M1 patients.
      Currently, there is no level-1 evidence for specific treatment of C1M0 patients, why further
      research is required to approach this patient group in the most comprehensive way. The focus
      group of our study is therefore C1M0 patients, because of the difference in opinions.
      Furthermore most evidence is based on gastric carcinomas, why GEJ-cancer patients are the
      group, we will examine.

      Purpose:

      Peritoneal washing cytology (PWC) is performed as a standard prediagnostic modality at
      Rigshospitalet, for patients with gastric- and GEJ cancer, considered resectable at
      preceding multidisciplinary conference. Most studies in the past 20-years have focused on
      gastric cancer, and not specifically GEJ-cancer.

      This study will determine the usefulness of peritoneal washing cytology, and thereby
      verifying our own standard regarding GEJ-cancer. Furthermore, we will determine the effect
      of neoadjuvant chemotherapy on free peritoneal tumor cells and its correlation with overall
      survival.

      This study is intended as a validation of our own standard.

      Damage control laparotomy (DCL) has proven to be a successful means to improve survival in
      severely injured patients.1-5 However, the consequences of not being able to close the
      fascia after the initial operation due to significant resuscitation leading to bowel and
      retroperitoneal edema, abdominal compartment syndrome, and continued acidosis, coagulopathy
      and hypethermia6-7 has led to a new challenge. Delays in primary fascial closure (PFC)
      contributes to increased fluid losses and nutritional demands,8-9 abdominal wall hernias,
      enterocutaneous fistula, and intra-abdominal infections.10-13 Hypertonic saline (HTS) use
      after DCL has been suggested to reduce bowel edema and resuscitation volumes, thus allowing
      for a quicker time to closure.14 Investigators will randomize patients to receiving HTS or
      standard crystalloid solutions after DCL and compare the time to PFC, rate of successful
      closure, and rate of complications associated with an open abdomen. The current failure rate
      of PFC after DCL is approximately 25%. Investigators believe they can improve PFC rates

      The molecular mechanisms participating in the various aspects of the DNA Damage Response
      (DDR) are absolutely essential to maintain the genome dynamics essential to all living
      organisms. The most commonly studied consequence of faulty DDR is genome instability
      participating in cancer onset. In the present proposal, we wish to explore another aspect of
      DDR, not relevant to cancer, which is its absolute requirement at several key steps of the
      development, maturation, and function of the immune system.

      The most ""spectacular"" consequences of faulty DNA repair processes with respect to the
      immuno-hematopoietic tissue are the complete block of B and T lymphocytes maturation owing
      to defective DNA joining phase during V(D)J recombination resulting in patients with Severe

      and thus, to better understand why and how dysfunctions of these DNA repair processes result
      in human severe conditions such as CVID, LOCID or other manifestations of immune disorders

      This study will test the safety and effectiveness of combination therapy with
      cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) and fludarabine in treating lupus nephritis (kidney
      inflammation). This condition, common in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, is
      caused by abnormal action of immune cells called lymphocytes against the kidneys. Left
      untreated, severe cases can result in loss of kidney function. The current treatment of
      choice-intermittent high doses (pulses) of cyclophosphamide-does not work in all patients
      and causes infertility in many women. The rate of infertility in men is not known. This
      study will examine whether fludarabine can safely be given with significantly lower doses of
      cyclophosphamide, and if this combination controls kidney inflammation.

      Patients 18 years of age and older with severe lupus nephritis (called proliferative lupus
      nephritis) may be eligible for this study. Candidates will have a history and physical
      examination; blood and urine tests; chest X-ray; electrocardiogram; cancer screening that
      may include a Pap smear, mammogram, rectal examination, PSA testing, and sigmoidoscopy.

      Participants will be divided into one of the following treatment groups:

      Group 1-Patients undergo three treatment cycles of cyclophosphamide, taken by mouth, and
      fludarabine, injected subcutaneously (under the skin). Patients receive both drugs on day 1
      of the cycle, and fludarabine alone on days 2 and 3. This regimen is repeated once every 5
      weeks for three cycles.

      Group 2-Same as for Group 1, except fludarabine injections are given intravenously (through
      a vein) for the second treatment cycle. Patients in this group have frequent blood sampling
      during the first and second treatment cycles to monitor blood levels of the drug. Samples
      are collected before the first injection is given and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 8, 24 and 48
      hours after the third injection. A total 12 tablespoons of blood is drawn over a 2-month
      period.

      All patients will have blood drawn once or twice a week during the first two cycles and then
      less frequently to monitor blood counts. Some patients will have the following additional
      procedures to test the effects of treatment on lymphocytes:

        1. Blood sample collection

        2. Bone marrow aspiration-The skin over the hip bone is cleaned and a local anesthetic is
           injected into the outer covering of the bone. Bone marrow is suctioned through the
           needle into an attached syringe. The procedure is done before treatment begins, at the
           end of treatment, and 6 months after treatment.

        3. Tonsillar biopsy-The tonsils are numbed with a local anesthetic and 1 to 4 pieces of
           tissue are removed using special forceps. The procedure is done before treatment
           begins, at the end of treatment, and 6 months after treatment.

NCT00313807,Study of Intravenous Amino Acid Infusion to Prevent Contrast Dye Mediated Renal Damage,"
      Exposure to radiographic contrast dye during coronary angiography is well known to cause
      either transient decreases in renal function or acute renal failure. Although the overall
      incidence is low, acute renal failure occurs most frequently in patients with both diabetes
      and chronic renal failure where the average reported incidence is upwards of 20%. The
      etiology of contrast-induced nephropathy is related to acute decline in renal blood flow
      following dye exposure resulting in ischemic injury at the level of the medulla. The
      development of acute renal failure following radiocontrast dye administration is significant
      because it contributes to morbidity and mortality in patients at risk.

      The administration of amino acids, either through intravenous infusion or a protein meal,
      results in a substantial increase in renal plasma flow (RPF) and glomerular filtration rate
      (GFR). In both healthy subjects and in those with chronic renal failure, an amino acid
      infusion produces a 20% rise in GFR and effective RPF.

      We hypothesize that the 20% rise in effective RPF and GFR following an amino acid infusion
      will counteract the radiocontrast dye-induced vasoconstriction and reduce the renal toxicity
      of contrast medium in a group of high-risk patients.

NCT00549107,Prophylactic Use of Levosimendan Versus Milrinone in Open Heart Surgery in Infants,"
      Pediatric patients, especially infants undergoing open heart surgery have a predictable fall
      in cardiac index 6 to 18 hours after surgery, the so-called low cardiac output syndrome
      (LCOS). Patients, who have LCOS require more monitoring, more medication and a longer stay
      in intensive care unit. To prevent LCOS the phosphodiesterase inhibitor milrinone is
      routinely used during the first 24 hours after surgery. Levosimendan, a calcium- sensitizer
      improves cardiac muscle contractile force, vascular smooth muscle relaxation and coronary
      blood flow through calcium sensitization of the myocardial contractile filaments and opening
      of potassium channels without increasing oxygen consumption of the heart muscle cells. As
      the myocardium of infants is more calcium dependent than in later life, levosimendan should
      be of special benefit in this age group. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether
      levosimendan is superior to milrinone in preventing LCOS in infants after corrective open

NCT00738283,Zinc and Copper Absorption in Neonates With Bilious Losses,"
      We propose to examine the absorption and excretion of zinc and copper in infants with
      ostomies. This will be accomplished by measuring baseline excretion and serum levels of
      zinc, copper, and ceruloplasmin, and by utilizing stable isotopes of zinc and copper to
      measure absorption and excretion.

      To determine how the presence of an ileostomy impacts zinc and copper metabolism in infants
      at three time points: 1) when the infant has an ostomy and is receiving the majority of
      calories from total parenteral nutrition (TPN); 2) when the infant has an ostomy and is
      receiving primarily enteral nutrition without TPN; and 3) when/if the infant has a surgery
      to reconnect the bowel and is receiving primarily enteral nutrition.

      For the first part of the study, excretion data for zinc will be obtained for ostomy
      patients. We hypothesize that infants with an ostomy will excrete more zinc in their stools
      than healthy term or preterm infants without ostomies.

      For the second part of the study, we will obtain data on zinc absorption, secretion, and
      excretion through use of stable isotopes. Jalla et al determined that healthy infants retain
      zinc of 0.4 mg/day. We hypothesize that due to increased zinc losses, the infants in the
      study will be less positive than the healthy infants in the study by Jalla et al. Our study
      is designed to be able to detect if the ostomy patients net retention is one-half that
      described by Jalla (i.e. 0.2 mg/d). We will also obtain data on copper absorption,
      secretion, and excretion through the use of stable isotopes in the second part of the study.
      As a pilot study, we do not fully know what to expect regarding copper levels in infants
      with ostomies, but we hypothesize that they may be less positive than healthy infants
      without ostomies. Also, we hypothesize that zinc and copper are competitively absorbed in
      the gut; therefore, infants who receive more zinc may absorb less copper.

      For the third part of the study, we will obtain data on zinc absorption through the use of
      stable isotopes after the infant has had surgery to reanastomose the bowel. We hypothesize
      that there may be continued zinc losses above those documented for healthy infants who have
      never had an ostomy, but decreased losses compared to when the infant had an ostomy.

      the urine concentration of S100B affected by intracranial pathology in this gestational age
      range? Elevation of urine concentration of S100B may be an indicator that the infant will
      develop serious intracranial pathology and may allow for early initiation of treatment to

NCT00770705,Parenteral Phenoxybenzamine During Congenital Heart Disease Surgery,"
      Phenoxybenzamine, an irreversible alpha-adrenergic blocker, may prove beneficial to infants
      and children with congenital heart disease undergoing open cardiac repair, due to a
      theoretic benefits of a uniform and smooth reduction in systemic vascular resistance in the
      perioperative period. Vasodilation allows for low pressure, high flow systemic perfusion
      while on cardiopulmonary bypass. Support for the use of phenoxybenzamine in humans has been
      documented in several studies involving the perioperative management of both adults and
      children requiring cardiopulmonary bypass, and in management of patients with
      pheochromocytoma. 1-7 Phenoxybenzamine has been associated with more uniform body cooling
      and rewarming, and improved tissue perfusion during bypass.8 It is also known to increase
      cardiac output, stroke volume, and renal blood flow when given intravenously. 9 Specifically
      in pediatric open heart surgery, the combined use of phenoxybenzamine and dopamine provided
      a stable hemodynamic condition without a high total peripheral vascular resistance and
      stimulated postoperative diuresis. 9 Afterload reduction with parenteral phenoxybenzamine in
      neonates undergoing the Norwood procedure for hypoplastic left heart syndrome is associated
      with improved systemic oxygen delivery and stabilization of systemic vascular resistance.10
      Furthermore, a strategy of reducing afterload with phenoxybenzamine and stabilizing the
      pulmonary to systemic flow ratio in this select population of patients has also been shown
      to improve operative survival. 11 We hypothesize that phenoxybenzamine will reduce afterload
      on the systemic ventricle in our selected patient population, thereby improving ventricular
      performance and decreasing the risks of pulmonary to systemic flow imbalance associated with
      current short-acting vasodilator therapy. We will plan to evaluate both physiologic
      variables as well as surgical outcomes in the selected study population.

NCT01062828,Defining Normal Citrulline Levels as a Diagnostic Tool for Screening of Gastrointestinal Disease in Premature Infants,"
      Since the first description of citrulline as a potential marker for intestinal function in
      1998, its use has been investigated in a variety of disease processes including Short Bowel
      Syndrome, Celiac disease, chemotherapy and radiation induced intestinal injury, infections
      producing intestinal cytopathic effects like Adenovirus, and predicting rejection in
      intestinal transplantation. The use of citrulline levels as a diagnostic tool to predict
      gastrointestinal disease in the premature population has not been properly addressed.

      The introduction of enteral nutrition in the premature infant is a process of trial and
      error, knowing that the immaturity of the gastrointestinal system may lead to frequent
      episodes of feeding intolerance. This is augmented by the fear of the development of
      necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) once feeds are commenced. NEC is a condition characterized
      by disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier, a pathogenic process shared with some of
      the conditions mentioned above for which citrulline has proven clinically useful.

      A normal pattern of citrulline production has not been established in the premature
      population. Previous studies have shown decreased levels of glutamine and arginine in
      premature infants up to 10 days prior to the development of necrotizing enterocolitis.
      Glutamine and arginine are two amino acids closely involved in the synthesis and catabolism
      of citrulline.

      The investigators therefore hypothesize that defining a normal pattern of citrulline
      production in the premature population may prove to be a clinically useful diagnostic tool
      to screen for gastrointestinal disease.

NCT01641289,Paracetamol Effect on Oxidative Stress and Renal Function in Severe Malaria,"
      Blackwater fever, characterized by intravascular haemolysis and hemoglobinuria, is an
      important cause of renal impairment and mortality in severe malaria caused by Plasmodium
      falciparum. The largest malaria clinical trials report blackwater incidences of 5-7% in
      Asian adults and 4% in African children with severe malaria treated with artesunate or
      quinine. The prevalence of blackwater fever in Chittagong, Bangladesh is 15% with associated
      rates of renal failure and mortality of 42.9% and 14.2% respectively.

      The fundamental characteristic of blackwater fever is the presence of intravascular
      hemolysis of both infected and uninfected erythrocytes and release of free haemoglobin. The
      cytotoxic free haemoglobin present can cause severe oxidative damage as a result of haem
      redox cycling yielding ferric and ferryl heme, which generate radical species that induce
      lipid peroxidation and subsequent production of F2-isoprostanes (F2-IsoPs). Evidence
      suggests that F2-IsoPs generated by the hemoprotein-catalyzed oxidation of lipids are
      responsible for the oxidative damage and vasoconstriction associated with renal injury in
      haemolytic disorders and rhabdomyolysis.

      A novel mechanism of paracetamol was recently demonstrated, showing that paracetamol is a
      potent inhibitor of hemoprotein-catalyzed lipid peroxidation by reducing ferryl heme to its
      less toxic ferric state and quenching globin radicals. In a recent proof of concept trial,
      paracetamol at therapeutic levels was shown to significantly decrease oxidant kidney injury,
      improve renal function and reduce renal damage by inhibiting the hemoprotein-catalyzed lipid
      peroxidation in a rat model of rhabdomyolysis-induced renal injury. Since adults with severe
      malaria demonstrate increased concentrations of cell-free haemoglobin, and urinary F2-IsoPs,
      the investigators hypothesize that this novel inhibitory mechanism of paracetamol may
      provide renal protection in this population by reducing the hemoprotein-induced lipid
      peroxidation. As there is currently no consensus that exists concerning adequate medical
      treatment for blackwater fever, the potential application of this safe and extensively used
      drug would be of great benefit.

NCT01700231,Plasma and Hemodynamic Markers During Hepatectomy,"
      Introduction Liver resection is considered the only curative treatment option for mCRC
      patients without extrahepatic disease and is accepted practice. Despite substantial
      improvements in surgical techniques, postoperative morbidity and mortality remain an
      important concern after major resections. Complications of liver resection, although rare,
      include liver failure and acute kidney injury as indicated by oliguria and increased serum
      creatinine. The underlying pathophysiological pathways of post-operative renal alteration
      following liver resection is an increase in portal venous pressure, based on observations in
      animal models or small cohorts. The corpus of data is derived from patients with liver
      cirrhosis and subsequent hepatorenal syndrome. These data are limited since cirrhosis cannot
      distinguish between metabolic changes, portal hypertension and impaired liver function in
      the elucidation of the pathogenesis of renal alterations. Liver resection is therefore a
      potent model to evaluate the impact of portal hypertension on the kidney despite stable
      liver function.

      The most significant factor determining morbidity and mortality following hepatectomy is the
      ability of the remnant liver to regenerate. In this context, several growth factors were
      shown to regulate the highly orchestrated process of liver regeneration (LR).

      Hypothesis The investigators will therefore test the hypothesis that liver resection leads
      to a sustained increase of portalvenous pressure with a subsequent episode of oliguric renal
      impairment, correlating with the quantity of resected liver.

      Furthermore, the investigators will examine the relationship between postoperative liver
      regeneration and circulating growth factor levels in patients undergoing hepatectomy. Based
      on the preclinical data the investigators hypothesize that a circulating growth factor
      levels will be associated with delayed liver regeneration, an increased incidence of
      postoperative liver dysfunction and concomitant worse clinical outcome.

NCT01795638,Sodium Supplementation and Growth in Very Low Birth Weight Infants,"
      Adequate growth during the neonatal period is critical for optimal long term outcomes.
      Despite maximal calorie intake, sixty percent of very low birth weight infants still fail to
      thrive suggesting that factors other than total calorie intake are important in ensuring
      consistent weight gain. Several reports have indicated a positive sodium balance is critical
      in ensuring good weight gain in very low birth weight infants, however these infants are
      susceptible to low serum sodium concentrations. Urine sodium values are sometimes used to
      diagnosis of hyponatremia or negative sodium balance after the first two weeks of life, but
      there is no evidence for this practice in preterm neonates. Our central hypothesis is that
      early supplementation with sodium will ensure positive sodium balance in very low birth
      weight infants and will result in optimal weight gain and enhanced long term outcomes.
      Secondarily we hypothesize that low sodium concentrations in the urine will not correlate
      with low serum sodium values.

NCT01869933,Phase I Study Assessing the Ocular and Systemic Safety and Tolerability of OC-10X,"
      The present study is intended to evaluate the safety and tolerability of topical OC-10X
      Ophthalmic Suspension in healthy human subjects. OcuCure Therapeutics, Inc. (Roanoke, VA)
      has developed a lead compound, known as OC-10X, which is a selective tubulin inhibitor under
      development for the treatment of Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (PDR) and Age-related
      Macular Degeneration (AMD). When administered as a topical eye drop, OC-10X has demonstrated
      both anti-angiogenic (inhibition) and angiolytic (regression) properties in animal models of
      AMD. Unlike other therapies, OC-10X provides the efficacy of a vascular targeting agent
      without the traditional toxicity and works downstream independently of growth factors. As
      demonstrated by OcuCure's preclinical data, tubulin inhibition using OC-10X has promise as a
      new therapeutic approach. PDR is a major cause of blindness in adults and is also caused by
      the growth of abnormal blood vessels. These new blood vessels are fragile and may hemorrhage
      into the vitreous. PDR affects up to 80% of all diabetics who have had diabetes for 15 years
      or more. If administration of OC-10X is well tolerated as a topical eye drop and is well
      tolerated systemically, then OC-10X will have the potential to provide benefits to patients
      with ocular diseases associated with angiogenesis.

NCT02147470,Evaluation of Renal Blood Flow Using Contrast Enhanced Ultrasound for Differential Diagnosis of Acute Kidney Injury in Cirrhotic Patients: A Pilot Study,"
      Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is a common cause of acute kidney injury (AKI) in cirrhotic
      patients and has a one month survival rate of 50% and a 3 month survival rate of 20%. The
      leading theory behind HRS is selective vasoconstriction of renal vasculature in the setting
      of decreased systemic vascular resistance. Patients with liver cirrhosis suffer from a large
      degree of third spacing in the form of peripheral edema and ascites. In addition treatment
      with multiple drugs, including diuretics puts these patients at higher risks of prerenal AKI
      and ischemic acute tubular necrosis (ATN). AKI occurring due to HRS, prerenal AKI and
      ischemic or nephrotoxic ATN have different pathophysiologic mechanisms and are treated
      differently with significantly different outcomes. While renal perfusion is expected to be
      reduced in HRS and prerenal AKI, it is normal or increased in ATN. Prerenal AKI has the most
      favorable prognosis among these pathologies and treatment simply consists of volume
      expansion with blood, albumin, crystalloids or colloids. In clinical practice vasoactive
      agents such as midodrine and octreotide are used to increase the tone of splanchnic vessels
      and to improve renal perfusion. These interventions would not affect renal function in cases
      with ATN. Unfortunately, the diagnostic criteria proposed by the International Club for
      Ascites (ICA) for HRS are not specific and do not always exclude patients with other forms
      of acute kidney injury. Therefore, availability of a simple diagnostic tool for measurement
      of renal blood flow (RBF) at the bedside would be of great value in management of cases with
      cirrhosis of the liver presenting with acute reduction in kidney function. However,
      currently, there are no practical and simple tools available for this purpose.

      Contrast enhanced ultrasonography (CEU) involves the intravenous injection of gas-filled
      microbubbles to enhance the ultrasound image of the organs and mainly to assess tissue
      vascularity and blood flow. We and others have used CEU to assess changes in RBF in response
      to physiologic stimuli and therapeutic interventions. Here we propose a prospective, pilot
      diagnostic study to validate the use of CEU, in assessing RBF in cirrhotic patients with
      AKI, and to assess the utility of CEU to differentiate between causes of AKI in cirrhotic
      patients.

      Our hypothesis is that CEU will show arteriolar vasoconstriction and decreased blood flow in
      the renal cortex in patients with HRS which would not change in response to volume
      expansion. On the contrary, patients with prerenal AKI will have reduced RBF which will
      increase after volume expansion. Finally, those with ATN will not have a reduced RBF at
      baseline.

      We plan to enroll 25 patients with liver cirrhosis and acute kidney injury who are admitted
      to the University of Virginia hospital into the study.

      CEU will be performed on all subjects to measure baseline RBF. CEU will be repeated in all
      subjects within 24 hours after volume expansion with at least 1gm/kg of albumin (up to 100
      gm/day) to assess a potential change. Hourly urine output and serum creatinine will be
      monitored for potential renal response to the volume expansion as part of clinical care. For
      the subgroup of subjects who receive treatment with combination therapy with albumin,
      midodrine, and octreotide (AMO) RBF assessment with CEU will be repeated after at least 48
      hours of receiving this combination. Renal response will be assessed by monitoring urine
      output and serum creatinine monitored as part of clinical care. All subjects will have
      measurements of fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) and urea (FEUrea) and urine microscopy
      as a part of their routine clinical care (work up of AKI). The results of these tests and
      the response to volume expansion will be used to categorize subjects into three categories
      of AKI (HRS, prerenal AKI, ATN). Correlations between RBF and its changes between different
      therapeutic interventions and renal diagnosis will be tested in this study.

NCT02338895,Algorithm for Oliguria in Septic Shock,"
      Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) develops in 88% to 30% of critically ill patients admitted to an
      intensive care unit and is a strong predictor of mortality.Therefore any management strategy
      that prevents progression of renal risk to injury or failure has the potential to improve
      outcomes in these patients.Conventional management of acute oliguria in shock has been to
      blindly 'push' fluids to improve renal perfusion or to give loop diuretics once fluid
      loading has been considered as accomplished. However both volume overload and 'blind'
      attempts at fluid removal can worsen renal injury and have been associated with higher
      mortality by venous overcongestion and inappropriate hypovolemia. It seems reasonable to
      assume that a bedside test to visualize volume status and renal perfusion may assist in
      improving outcomes in this cohort.The investigators developed a goal-directed
      ultrasonographic protocol to provide immediate hemodynamic information in acutely oliguric
      patients with shock as well as a management algorithm for guiding therapy. The investigators
      incorporated IVC diameter measurement, respiratory variation and response to a passive leg
      raise to assess whether further fluid boluses were required and a measurement of renal
      perfusion to determine whether diuretics or renal replacement therapy were indicated. The

      There are several choices to consider when determining the timing of initiation of enteral

      longer period of starvation (18 hours) before initiating feedings. The ongoing debate arises
      over whether a physician chooses a standardized, incremental feeding regimen versus an ad
      libitum feeding schedule which allows the infant to decide when and how much to eat. Neither
      has been studied effectively in a randomized controlled setting. A recent review of the

      each group will be randomly assigned to 1) LVEDP-guided hydration with normal saline
      (LVEDP-guided group). The fluid infusion rate will be adjusted according to the LVEDP as
      follows: 5 mL/kg/hr for LVEDP <12 mmHg; 3 mL/kg/hr for 13-18 mmHg; and 1.5 mL/kg/hr for >18

      evaluating new approaches to reducing the current and future burden of urinary
      schistosomiasis in young children using the antihelminthic drug Praziquantel. The project
      aims to (1) determine the operational health benefits of treating schistosome infections
      early on re-infection and morbidity reduction, (2) determine if gut or urine microbiome
      structure (species diversity or abundance) is a risk factor for S. haematobium infection or
      morbidity, and (3) elucidate the factors and underlying mechanisms mediating the
      reduction/reversal of schistosome-related morbidity and resistance against
      infection/re-infection in young children.

NCT02531412,Spironolactone Administration to Prevent Ischemic Kidney Injury in Critically Ill Cancer Patients,"
      Acute kidney injury frequently affects cancer patients. The main cause of acute kidney
      injury is ischemic damage caused by transient decrease in renal blood flow, followed by
      blood flow restoration and accompanying reperfusion injury (ischemia-reperfusion injury.
      Several studies, mainly in animal models have tried to establish spironolactone role on
      kidney injury induced by ischemia-reperfusion injury. It has been demonstrated in renal
      transplant recipients that the administration of spironolactone can prevent oxidative stress
      and is safe. The group of cancer patients with states capable of producing tissue
      hypoperfusion (hypovolemic shock, heart failure, major surgery, use of anesthetics) are at
      increased risk of developing acute renal ischemia-reperfusion injury.

      The investigators hypothesis is that spironolactone may be useful in preventing acute renal
      injury when administered during the first six hour of renal ischemia-reperfusion insult.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the utility of spironolactone administered after
      an ischemic renal insult (major surgery) to prevent acute kidney injury in critically cancer
      patients.

      Investigators propose a pilot study, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial,
      approved by the local ethical committee, to compare the efficacy of spironolactone to
      prevent acute kidney injury in patients after major surgery. Investigators will include 12
      patients in spironolactone group (25mg daily for three days) and 12 patients in placebo
      group.

NCT00086879,Erlotinib Compared With Temozolomide or Carmustine in Treating Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme,"
      RATIONALE: Erlotinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary
      for their growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide and carmustine, work in
      different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. It is not yet
      known whether erlotinib is more effective than temozolomide or carmustine in treating
      recurrent glioblastoma multiforme.

NCT00094887,Nitric Oxide Inhalation to Treat Sickle Cell Pain Crises,"
      This study will examine whether nitric oxide (NO) gas can reduce the time it takes for pain
      to go away in patients who are in sickle cell crisis. NO is important in regulating blood
      vessel dilation, and consequently, blood flow. The gas is continuously produced by cells
      that line the blood vessels. It is also transported from the lungs by hemoglobin in red
      blood cells.

      Patients 10 years of age or older with sickle cell disease (known SS, S-beta-thalassemia or
      other blood problems causing sickle cell disease) may be eligible for this study. Patients
      whose disease is due to hemoglobin (Hgb) SC are excluded. Candidates are screened with blood
      tests and a chest x-ray to look at the lungs and heart.

      Participants are admitted to the hospital in a pain crisis. They are evaluated and then
      randomly assigned to receive one of two treatments: 1) standard treatment plus NO, or 2)
      standard treatment plus placebo. The placebo used in this study is nitrogen, a gas that
      makes up most of the air we breathe and is not known to help in sickle cell disease.

      For the first 8 hours of the study, patients receive placebo or NO through a facemask. The
      mask may be taken off for 5 minutes every hour and for not more than 20 minutes to eat a
      meal. After the first 8 hours, the gas is delivered through a nasal cannula (small plastic
      tubing that rests under the nose) that may be taken off only while showering or using the
      restroom. Patients are questioned about the severity of their pain when they start the study
      and then every few hours while they are in the hospital. Their vital signs (temperature,
      breathing rate, and blood pressure) and medicines are checked. Patients will breathe the gas
      for a maximum of 3 days, but will stay hospitalized until the patient feels well enough to
      go home. Patients are followed up about 1 month after starting the study by a return visit
      to the hospital or by a phone call.

NCT00455468,Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) in Children With Severe Pneumonia,"
      Pneumonia is the leading cause of childhood morbidity and death in many developing countries
      including Bangladesh, causing about 2 million deaths worldwide each year. Pneumonia is an
      infection of the lungs, most commonly caused by viruses or bacteria like Streptococcus
      pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. Depending on the clinical presentation, pneumonia can
      be classified as very severe, severe or non-severe, with specific treatment for each of them
      except for antibiotic therapy. Severe and very severe pneumonia require hospitalization for
      additional supportive treatment such as suction, oxygen therapy and administration of
      bronchodilator. In Bangladesh, the number of hospital beds is inadequate for admission of
      all pneumonia cases that require hospitalization; however, it is also important to provide
      institutional care to those children who cannot be hospitalized due to bed constraints.
      Provision of appropriate antibiotics and supportive cares during the period of stay at
      established day-care centres could be an effective alternative. The impetus for this study
      came from the findings of our recently completed study titled ""Daycare-based management of
      severe pneumonia in under-5 children when hospitalization is not possible due to the lack of
      beds"". This study successfully managed children (n=251), but it was not a randomized trial
      and thus direct comparison of the efficacy of management of severe pneumonia at the day-care
      centre, essential for building confidence for implementing this management policy, is not
      possible. We, the researchers at the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research,
      Bangladesh, could not plan a randomized, controlled trial (RCT) because of ethical reasons.
      Now that we have data suggesting effectiveness as well as safety of the day-care based
      treatment for management of children with severe pneumonia, a RCT should be possible. Two
      hundred fifty-one children with severe pneumonia were enrolled at the Radda Clinic from June
      2003 to May 2005. The mean age was 7±7 (2-55) months, 86% infants, 63% boys and 91%
      breast-fed. History of cough was present in 99% cases, fever in 89% and rapid breathing in
      67% cases. Forty-four percent of children were febrile (≥38°C), 93% children had vesicular
      breath sound and 99% bilateral rales. Fifty-seven percent of children were hypoxic with mean
      oxygen saturation of (93±4)%, which was corrected by oxygen therapy (98±3)%. Eighty percent
      of children had severe pneumonia and 20% had very severe pneumonia. The mean duration of
      clinic stay was (7±2) days. Two hundred thirty-four (93%) children completed the study
      successfully, 11 (4.4%) referred to hospitals (only one participant had to visit hospital at
      night due to deterioration of his condition, 9 were referred to hospital at the time of
      clinic closure i.e., at 5 pm and one participant was referred to hospital during the morning
      hours) and 6 (2.4%) left against medical advice (LAMA). There was no death during the period
      of clinic stay but only four (1.6%) deaths occurred during the 3 months follow-up. The study
      indicated that treatment of severe pneumonia in children at the day-care centre is effective
      and safe and thus it is comparable to the hospital care. If the day-care based management is
      found to have comparable efficacy to that of hospitalized management of severe pneumonia in
      children then they could be managed at outpatient, day-care set ups reducing hospitalization
      and thus freeing beds for management of other children who need hospitalized care.
      Additionally, availability of the treatment facility in community set-ups will be cost and
      time saving for the population. Children of either sex, aged 2-59 months, attending the
      Radda Clinic and Institute of Child Health and Shishu Hospital (ICHSH) with severe pneumonia
      will be randomized to receive either the day-care management at the clinic or hospitalized
      management at the ICHSH. Children randomized to receive day-care treatment will stay at the
      clinic from 8 am-5 pm and will receive antibiotics and other supportive cares. At 5 pm, they
      would be send to respective homes with advice to bring back their children to the clinic
      next morning, and advised to provide other supports at home. The same management would be
      continued till improvement and discharged and followed up every 2 weeks for 3 months.
      Children randomized to receive hospitalized management would be admitted at ICHSH and
      receive standard treatment like antibiotics and other supportive cares. The same treatment
      would be continued for 24 hours/day (rather than 9 hours/day at the day-care clinic) till
      improvement and discharged and followed-up at the ICHSH every 2 weeks for 3 months. About
      3000 children with pneumonia visit Radda Clinic each year and about 200 of them will have
      severe pneumonia requiring hospitalization. Thus, we hope to enroll 368 (184 in each site)
      children with severe pneumonia during a 2-year study period.

      Many children with ""non-severe pneumonia"" (cough and fast breathing) have neither clinical
      pneumonia as assessed by physicians nor pneumonia on chest radiographs. Inappropriate use of
      antibiotics for these cases is leading to resistant strains of bacteria in the community.
      Evidence shows that almost 50% of antibiotic prescription is unnecessary.As over half of
      antibiotic prescription for ARI are not necessary since most of these infections are viral
      and do not respond to antibiotic therapy which will be source of resistance in the
      community.

      To address this issue the investigators conducted this randomized, double blind placebo
      controlled clinical trial of oral Amoxicillin versus placebo in children with non-severe
      pneumonia taking into account all the necessary safety precautions for their well being.

NCT01087892,Probiotics in Preventing Antibiotic Associated Diarrhoea Including Clostridium Difficile Infection,"
      Antibiotics are currently required to treat patients in hospital when they have an
      infection, but these antibiotics can cause side effects such as diarrhoea and in some
      patients a serious form of gut infection with an organism called Clostridium difficile. This
      organism can produce toxins in the gut causing a severe form of diarrhoea associated with a
      lot of ill health, and in some circumstances can be fatal. Some studies have shown that
      yogurts' or Probiotics' (special drinks with a defined concentration of useful bacteria)
      taken by patients can have a beneficial effect in reducing the diarrhoea associated with
      antibiotics use. The aim of the present study is to find out whether the use of one of these
      Probiotics in hospitalised patients taking antibiotics will result in less diarrhoea, less
      Clostridium difficile infection, as well as cost saving. The study will also analyze the
      effects of probiotics on quality of life and length of hospital stay.

NCT01099943,Reducing Inappropriate Antibiotic Prescribing by Primary Care Clinicians,"
      Hypotheses and Specific Aims:

      The continued emergence of antibiotic-resistance in the outpatient setting underlines the
      need to responsibly manage antimicrobial prescribing. It is in this context that we seek to
      test an effective strategy for reducing the inappropriate use of antibiotics in primary care
      office practices. Our overall objective is to identify an effective and efficient strategy
      for decreasing the contribution of primary care clinicians to the emergence of
      antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in the community and to disseminate widely those strategies
      found to be effective and sustainable.

      We hypothesize that implementation of a clinician decision support system, with an active
      education component, will reduce the inappropriate use of antibiotics in primary care office
      practices. Our hypothesis is based on the premise that most inappropriate prescribing is the
      result of multiple factors that include difficulty in distinguishing a benign, self-limited
      viral infection from a more serious bacterial infection; overdiagnosis of a bacterial
      infection in cases where there is clinical uncertainty as to the true nature of the illness;
      and constraints on the time available for clinicians to explain to patients the nature of
      the illness and the reasons an antibiotic is not indicated.

      The focus of this proposal will be to compare the impact of clinical decision support and
      active education to no intervention for enhancing the appropriate use of antimicrobials for
      common outpatient infections. In this randomized control trial, primary care providers
      participating in the intervention arm will receive active education coupled with the
      implementation of a clinical decision support tool, while providers in the control arm will
      have no intervention. At the end of the study, providers in the control arm will receive a
      thorough analysis of their antibiotic prescribing patterns and suggested opportunities for
      improvement, as well as access to the intervention tools once the study has ended.

      Our interdisciplinary team will integrate novel methods in implementation science with
      clinical and laboratory expertise in infectious diseases, antimicrobial stewardship, primary
      care, information technology, performance improvement, health services research, and
      biostatistics. The Specific Aims are constructed to validate our hypothesis in the primary
      care setting by demonstrating two results of our intervention strategy:

        1. Reduced use of antibiotics to treat conditions for which those drugs are known not to
           be effective

        2. Decreased prescribing of broad-spectrum antibiotics to treat common bacterial
           infections.

      The degree of impact in terms of prescriptions per 100 visits for each targeted outpatient
      infection will be compared with active education and clinical decision support versus no
      intervention. The study will be able to measure the value of clinical decision support with
      active education that will inform future efforts in disseminating outpatient antibiotic
      stewardship interventions.

      to treat lupus nephritis more effectively and with less toxicity than standard treatments,
      including cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan), azothioprine (Imuran) and prednisone.

      The body's immune system naturally produces antibodies to fight foreign substances like
      bacteria and viruses. In autoimmune diseases like lupus, however, the body makes antibodies
      that attack its own tissues, causing inflammation and organ damage. Lupus antibodies attack
      and damage kidney cells. BG9588 can interfere with the production of these antibodies, and
      therefore, may lessen kidney damage in people with lupus nephritis.

      This study will look at: how BG9588 enters and leaves the blood and body tissue over time;
      adverse effects of the drug; and whether treatment with BG9588 can result in less kidney
      damage than other therapies.

NCT00172666,Decoy Receptor 3 (DcR3) Polymorphisms in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE),"
      Although SLE and RA are correlated with genetic predisposing factors such as human leukocyte
      antigen (HLA) class II, both diseases and other genetic factors might have contributed to
      the development of dysregulated lymphocyte activation and autoimmunity.

      Decoy receptor 3 (DcR3)/TR6 is a secreted protein belonging to the tumor necrosis factor
      (TNF) receptor family. It binds to Fas ligand (FasL), LIGHT, and TL1A that are all TNF
      family members. It was noted that soluble or solid phase DcR3-Fc co-stimulated
      proliferation, lymphokine production and cytotoxicity of mouse and human T cells upon T-cell
      receptor (TCR) ligation. Recently, the investigators found that the serum level of soluble
      DcR3 was higher in SLE patients than in healthy control subjects (unpublished data). Taken
      together, the investigators propose that in autoimmune diseases, such as RA and SLE,
      activated T cells secrete more DcR3 than non-autoimmune controls, which may, in turn,
      costimulate T cells further and cause dysregulated lymphocyte activation. With the aim to
      establish the possible correlation between DcR3 genetic polymorphisms, DcR3 expressions, and
      autoimmune phenotypes, the investigators offer this proposal. They plan to investigate the
      single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the DcR3 gene. The genetic polymorphisms on the
      DcR3/TR6 gene and circulating DcR3 level will be compared between RA, SLE and non-autoimmune
      control subjects.

      Neuropsychiatric manifestations of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (NPSLE) are both common and
      an important source of morbidity. Of the case definitions for NPSLE syndromes that have
      recently been developed, cognitive dysfunction appears to be the most prevalent. A novel
      mechanism is that a subset of SLE patients with cognitive dysfunction have antibodies in the
      NR2 glutamate receptor. We propose, in a double -blind placebo-controlled trial, to
      determine whether SLE patients, with or without the NR2 glutamate receptor antibody, have
      significant improvement using memantine, an inhibitor of the NMDA receptor.

NCT00230035,Lupus Immunosuppressive/Immunomodulatory Therapy or Stem Cell Transplant (LIST),"
      Systemic lupus erythematosus, also known as lupus or SLE, is a chronic, multisystem,
      autoimmune disease in which the body's internal system of defense attacks its own normal
      tissues. This abnormal autoimmune response can result in damage to many parts of the body,
      especially the skin, joints, lungs, heart, brain, intestines, and kidneys. Both genetic and
      environmental risk factors are involved in the development of lupus, but these are poorly
      understood.

      SLE has an overall 10-year survival between 80 and 90%. However, we estimate that severe
      lupus not responding to the usual available treatments has a 50% mortality rate in 10 years.
      Kidney problems occur in 30% to 50% of lupus patients and may progress to kidney failure.
      Kidney disease due to lupus occurs more frequently in African-Americans and Hispanics. Lupus
      can affect many parts of the body and cause damage, but the severe form can result in death
      from kidney disease; cardiovascular disease, specifically atherosclerosis; central nervous
      system disease; and infections.

      Currently, no single standard therapy for treatment of severe SLE exists. Usually physicians
      prescribe an aggressive regimen of one or a combination of
      immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory treatments. This approach to therapy for all forms of
      severe SLE derives largely from studies of lupus nephritis. Current treatment, although
      effective in many people, are not effective in all patients and are associated with
      drug-induced morbidity. The design of the control arm for this study reflects the current
      status of treatment of SLE in the academic setting. Investigators may choose from a list of
      commonly used and currently available immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory treatments to
      optimize the treatment of their patients, based on their past treatment history and response
      to those treatments. Study treatments may consist of corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide
      (CTX), azathioprine, methotrexate, cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF),
      plasmapheresis, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), rituximab, and leflunomide. Treatment may
      be changed as frequently and as necessary within the first year of the study to control the
      manifestations of SLE in each patient. New therapies that become available during the course
      of this trial may be added to the list of approved medications for this study.

      In response to the absence of a uniformly effective treatment for severe lupus, autologous
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been proposed as a potential therapy.
      Hematopoietic stem cells are immature blood cells that can develop into all of the different
      blood and immune cells the body uses. Researchers believe that resetting the immune system
      may stop or slow down the progression of the disease. The main purpose of this study is to
      compare two ways of treating SLE: 1) high-dose immunosuppressive therapy (HDIT) followed by
      HSCT and 2) currently available immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory therapies.

NCT00275899,Role of DcR3 in T Cell Activation in SLE and RA,"
      Decoy receptor 3 (DcR3), a new member of tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily,
      is a decoy receptor for FasL and could inhibit FasL-induced apoptosis, has recently been
      shown to induce costimulation of T cells. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an
      autoimmune disease with pathogenic autoantibodies and immune complexes results from abnormal
      immune responses including T and B lymphocyte hyperactivity, and formation of pathogenic
      subsets of autoantibodies. Rhematoid arthritis (RA) is a multi-systemic autoimmune disease
      characterized by persistent inflammatory synovitis. Activated T lymphocytes infiltration to
      synovium is strongly correlated with the symptoms. DcR3 mRNA is expressed in
      peripheral-blood T cells and is up-regulated after antigenic stimulation. The DcR3 gene has
      been demonstrated to be overexpressed in patients with sclerosis or SLE; however, role of
      DcR3 in SLE and RA as well as the effects of DcR3 on T cell immune response is still not
      clear. This study is to investigate role of DcR3-induced T cell activation in SLE and RA.
      The genetic polymorphisms of DcR3 in association with SLE and RA will be studied to
      elucidate the genetic factors associated with development of SLE and RA. For further explore
      the possible molecular mechanisms of elevated DcR3 in association with SLE, we attempt to
      study whether DcR3 could induce T cell activation via costimualtion and/or inhibit the
      activation induced cell death (AICD) of activated T cells in SLE and RA. This study will
      provide a new direction of therapy in reverse T cell hyper-reactivity in SLE and RA.

NCT00364728,Efferocytosis and Genomic Polymorphism in Autoimmune Diseases,"
      Over the past few years, growing evidences revealed that clearance of apoptotic cells by
      phagocytosis can result in powerful anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects. In
      vivo, apoptotic cells are cleared rapidly by neighboring cells, macrophages and related
      scavengers. Defective clearance of apoptotic cells has been linked closely to autoimmunity
      and persistent inflammatory disease. Several phagocytic receptors, bridging molecules
      produced by phagocytes and 'eat-me' signals on apoptotic cells are coordinately involved in
      mediating clearance of apoptotic cells. Complement receptors (CR3, CR4), collection, CD14,
      CD36 (Class B scavenger receptor), class A scavenger receptor, asialoprotein receptor, Mer
      receptor kinase were reported to recognize apoptotic cells. The best characterized system
      for clearance of apoptotic cells is the recognition of phosphatidylserine (PS) on apoptotic
      cells by phosphatidylserine receptor (PSR). Milk fat globule- epidermal growth factor 8
      (MFG-E8) is an opsonin that bridges phagocytes (by interacting with α vβ3, αvβ5 integrins
      via RGD motif) and apoptotic cells (by binding PS through Factor V/VIII-C domain). Activated
      macrophages produce and secret MFG-E8. MFG-E8 is a critical component in PSR-mediated
      phagocytosis of apoptotic cells. The dominant negative mutant MFG-E8, D89E, that carried a
      mutated RGD motif inhibited phagocytosis of apoptotic cells in vitro. Injection of D89E into
      wild type mice induced autoantibodies and IgG deposition on glomeruli. Macrophages from
      MFG-E8 deficiency (MFG-E8-/-) mice were impaired in engulfment of apoptotic cells, which can
      be restored by adding recombinant MFG-E8. The female MFG-E8-/- mice spontaneously produced
      high titer of autoantibodies and developed lupus-like glomerulonephritis at the age of week
      40. Defective clearance of apoptotic cells is closely related to development of
      autoimmunity. In the past 4 years, a growing number of molecules were recognized as
      receptors for the PS exposed on the apoptotic cells. These molecules were capable of
      mediating phagocytic clearance, rendering anti-inflammatory cytokines in the phagocytes, and
      modulating T cell responses.

      The specific aim of this proposal is to study genetic polymorphism in MFG-E8, PSR and other
      factors implicated in phagocytic clearance of apoptotic cells among Taiwanese. By comparing
      the polymorphism between patients with autoimmune disease (SLE or RA) and healthy control
      subjects, we will investigate if genetic variations among individuals of genes encoding
      proteins involved in clearance of apoptotic cells contribute to the pathogenesis of systemic
      autoimmune diseases SLE and RA.

NCT01266915,Cutaneous Lupus Registry,"
      Approximately 1.4 million individuals in the United States have systemic lupus
      erythematosus, and about 85% of these individuals develop skin lesions at some point of
      their disease. Cutaneous lupus erythematosus represents the skin manifestations of systemic
      lupus erythematosus, and can appear in people with or without systemic lupus. It is a
      mentally, physically, and emotionally debilitating disease that affects both the quality of
      life and social well-being of those affected.

      The cause of cutaneous lupus is not completely understood, but likely includes multiple
      factors from our genes and the environment. Multiple genetic studies with small numbers of
      cutaneous lupus patients have been performed to determine which genes are associated with
      cutaneous lupus. This study aims to accumulate even larger numbers of patients to
      confidently identify genes and the proteins they encode that could contribute greatly to the
      formation of cutaneous lupus. The discovery of these genes and proteins would help not only
      uncover how cutaneous lupus forms, but also improve our abilities to diagnose this disease
      and predict its course, and stimulate new drug development.

NCT01276782,Levothyroxine in Pregnant SLE Patients,"
      The last two decades have witnessed an explosion of new research documenting the deleterious
      impact that thyroid disease has on pregnancy and the postpartum period, in relation to
      miscarriage preterm delivery intelligence quotient of the unborn child and health of the
      mother postpartum. Both subclinical hypothyroidism and thyroid antibody positivity in
      euthyroid women have been associated with miscarriage and preterm delivery. Approximately 5%
      of all pregnant women have a thyroid disorder. both spontaneous miscarriage and preterm
      delivery.

      Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), an autoimmune disorder of unknown etiology, has also
      been documented to negatively impact pregnancy. Women with Systemic lupus erythematosus
      (SLE)have increased rates of miscarriage and preterm delivery. Women with Systemic lupus
      erythematosus (SLE) also have increased rates of hypothyroidism and autoimmune thyroid
      disease (AITD, defined as the presence of thyroid antibodies with or without thyroid
      dysfunction). Preterm delivery (PTD), defined as birth prior to 37 weeks gestation, is the
      leading cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity in the United States. Although risk
      factors for preterm delivery exist, the majority of women have no known risk factors.
      Recently, both hypothyroidism and autoimmune thyroid disease have also been linked to
      preterm delivery. Given the increased prevalence of negative outcomes documented in pregnant
      women with thyroid disease, and the increased rates of hypothyroidism and Autoimmune thyroid
      disease in women with Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), the investigators determined that
      Autoimmune thyroid disease was associated with both preterm delivery and miscarriage. This
      has led to this application to begin a pilot randomized clinical trial of thyroxine in
      autoimmune thyroid disease in systemic lupus erythematosus pregnancy.

      works in treating patients with systemic scleroderma (SSc). Stem cells are collected from
      the patient's blood and stored prior to treatment. To store the stem cells patients are
      given colony-stimulating factors, such as filgrastim (G-CSF) or chemotherapy
      (cyclophosphamide) to help stem cells move from the bone marrow to the blood so they can be
      collected and stored. After storage, patients are then given high-dose chemotherapy,
      cyclophosphamide, and immunosuppression with anti-thymocyte globulin to suppress the immune
      system to prepare for the transplant. The stem cells are then returned to the patient to
      replace the blood-forming cells that were destroyed by the chemotherapy and
      immunosuppression. After the stem cells have ""engrafted"" and have matured enough to support
      the immune system at approximately 2-3 months, patients are given a medication called
      mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or Myfortic. This medication is given to prevent worsening or

      Up to 10% of patients with cancer will develop symptomatic brain metastases. Given this
      limited survival it is important to consider quality of life (QOL) when treating these
      patients. Whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) can increase survival to 6 month. However, WBRT
      itself has been shown to reduce QOL by increasing drowsiness, leg weakness and hair loss in
      patients with brain metastases. Both fatigue and hair loss were reported to have the largest
      decline in QOL scores when WBRT is used in the prophylactic setting in small cell lung
      cancer. Recent technological improvements in patient positioning and treatment planning will
      allow us to treat the whole brain with reduced margins, allowing better sparing of the
      scalp. In view of the large impact of hair loss on quality of life, the investigators
      hypothesize to see an improved quality of life with scalp sparing techniques.

NCT01440231,Atacicept Demonstrating Dose RESponSe,"
      Systemic lupus erythematosis (SLE) is an autoimmune disease, meaning that the body's immune
      system attacks its own organs and tissues. Within the immune system, B-cells and plasma
      cells make proteins called antibodies, which in autoimmune disease can bind to one's own
      tissues and are thus referred to as autoantibodies. Atacicept blocks 2 factors in the body,
      called BLyS and APRIL, which are important for the maintenance of B-cells and plasma cells,
      and thus the production of antibodies. This study will assess whether treatment with
      atacicept can reduce SLE disease activity. Atacicept is still an experimental drug, meaning
      that it is not available outside of a clinical trial, and that its potential benefits and
      risks have not been fully determined.

      A total of 175 subjects are planned to be randomized (35 subjects per treatment arm) in a

NCT01950780,Pilot Study to Evaluate the Efficacy of Ruxolitinib in Alopecia Areata,"
      Alopecia areata (AA) is a common disease of the immune system, known as an ""autoimmune""
      disease. In the disease, the immune system mistakenly destroys the hair follicle, causing
      hair to fall out. Despite many people having this disease, research into its cause and into
      new, better ways to treat AA has lagged far behind other similar diseases of the immune
      system. Currently, there are no Federal Drug Administration approved drugs for AA.

      Ruxolitinib (made by Incyte) is an intervention known to effectively treat a disease of the
      bone marrow, known as myelofibrosis. It is also being studied in the treatment of rheumatoid
      arthritis, another ""autoimmune"" disease, by fighting inflammation. There are some genetic
      and chemical similarities between those with myelofibrosis, active rheumatoid arthritis and
      AA, suggesting that treatment with ruxolitinib may be effective in AA. In mice specially
      designed for testing drugs for the treatment of human alopecia areata, this medication
      worked to prevent the disease AA from starting in mice that would have otherwise developed
      the disease. To test Ruxolitinib, we are going to treat 12 patients with moderate to severe
      AA for a minimum of 3 months up to 6 months. This is an ""open-label"" study, meaning that
      there will not be a placebo group; all patients enrolled in the study will receive the
      active medication. The effectiveness of the medication will be measured by changes in hair
      re-growth as determined by physical exam and photography, as well as by patient and
      physician scoring. Patients will be followed for another 3 months off of the drug to see if
      the effects of treatment last and if there is delayed response. The safety of the
      medication, ruxolitinib, in patients with alopecia areata will also be evaluated.

      Blood work will be collected before medication is started, during the treatment period, and
      after ruxolitinib is stopped, in order to monitor for adverse effects of the medication.
      Small scalp biopsies and peripheral blood will be taken at the beginning of the study before
      treatment and also after 12 and possibly 24 weeks. Optional biopsies may also be taken at
      additional time points based on clinical considerations. The chemical analysis of these skin
      samples and blood will help us to understand how the disease happens, how the treatment
      works, and may even guide us to better treatments in the future.

NCT01992666,GENetic & Immunologic Abnomalies in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,"
      Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease for which the aetiology
      includes genet-ic and environmental factors. It is rare in children as compared to adults.
      The severity may be related to greater involvement of genetic factors in children. The
      impact of genetics in the development of SLE is important, and the risk of recurrence in
      siblings evaluated by lambda S ratio is 30 in SLE, while it is 15 for type-1 diabetes and 8
      rheumatoid arthritis, thereby indicating high impact of genetics in SLE.

      Recently, the group of Professor Yanick Crow in Manchester and other teams has identified
      new forms of lupus Mendelian genetics. The TREX1 and genes involved in the SAMHD1 frostbite
      lupus.

      Nearly 2 % of all adult subjects with SLE have a heterozygous mutation in the TREX1 gene,
      which therefore represents the first genetic cause of SLE. The team of Professor Crow also
      identified the ACP5 gene that is responsible for SLE associated with Spondylo-epiphyseal
      enchondro-epiphyseal dysplasia (syndromic lupus). Other groups have identified mutations in
      two genes encoding a DNAse (DNAse1 and DNAse1L3) responsible for familial monogenic forms of
      SLE. These new genes SLE were identified through research of germ-line mutations in cases of
      lupus syndromic or family. In collaboration with Professor Crow, we are currently undergoing
      characterization of a novel gene of SLE in a family and we have identified a second locus
      identified in another family. The identification of these genes provides a better
      understanding of the mechanisms regulating immune tolerance in humans. The frequency of
      these genetic forms is not known. There is very little data on the immunological phenotype
      of these patients.

      This is a clinical study to investigate the genetic and immunological abnormalities
      associated with pediatric SLE. The aim are to:

        -  study the genetics of pediatric SLE (or syndromic or family) and to search for

      Cutaneous lupus is a chronic, relapsing, auto-immune skin disease that can have many
      presentations. Its effect on physical appearance greatly affects patients' quality of life.
      In addition, 10% of patients with cutaneous lupus will develop systemic lupus. Topical
      therapies are the mainstay of cutaneous lupus treatment; however patients often find these
      treatments to be messy, inconvenient, or ineffective. In addition, for more severe disease
      patients are often placed on concurrent systemic therapies. The primary hypothesis of our
      study is that poor adherence contributes to poor treatment outcomes in patients with

NCT02260934,Rituximab and Belimumab for Lupus Nephritis,"
      Lupus nephritis is a severe form of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with active disease
      in the kidneys. SLE is a complex disease in which the body's own immune system attacks some
      of the body parts: the skin, the joints, the kidneys, the nervous system, the heart, the
      lungs and the blood. The cause of SLE is not known. Treatment for SLE usually involves drugs
      that are designed to block the immune system attacks. When SLE affects the kidneys
      (nephritis), stronger immune suppressing treatment is usually needed.

      The drugs used in treatment of lupus nephritis often do not cure the disease and can cause
      serious side effects, including lowering the immune system too much. When the immune system
      is too low, a person is at a higher risk of getting infections. Therefore, research into new
      treatments with fewer serious side effects is needed for lupus nephritis.

      In this experimental study, researchers will try to find out if treatment of lupus nephritis
      with a combination of rituximab and cyclophosphamide (CTX), or a combination of rituximab
      and CTX followed by treatment with belimumab is safe and if this drug combination can block
      the immune system attacks.

NCT01022567,Appendicectomy Versus Antibiotics in the Treatment of Acute Uncomplicated Appendicitis,"
      Appendicectomy has been the treatment of acute appendicitis for over a hundred years.
      Appendicectomy, however, includes operative and postoperative risks despite being a
      ""routine"" operation. At the same time other similar intra-abdominal infections, such as
      diverticulitis, are treated with antibiotics. There have been some encouraging reports on
      successful treatment of appendicitis with antibiotics and it has been estimated that
      operative treatment might be necessary for only 15 - 20 % of patients with acute
      appendicitis.

      The aim of this randomized prospective study is to compare operative treatment (open
      appendicectomy) with conservative treatment with antibiotics (ertapenem, Invanz). Before
      randomization acute uncomplicated appendicitis is diagnosed with a CT scan.The hypothesis of
      the study is that the majority of patients with uncomplicated acute appendicitis can be

NCT01024439,Transumbilical Single Incision Versus Conventional Three Incisions Laparoscopic Appendicectomy,"
      Laparoscopic appendicectomy is widely practiced in Hong Kong nowadays with shorter hospital
      stay and less wound complications. Most of the time, three small wounds of less than 10mm
      will be adequate enough for the completion of the surgery with minimal pain.

      Recently, the concept of Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery (N.O.T.E.S) led to
      the attention of single incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) again in the surgical
      community. SILS is not a new idea. The first SILS for cholecystectomy was reported in 1997
      by Navarra et al. However, the close proximity of the instruments, limitation in
      triangulation during dissection and suboptimal exposure of the surgical field has made this
      approach unpopular in last decade. Because the concept of N.O.T.E.S and the newly designed
      access port, surgeons are now focused again on SILS. The Chinese University of Hong Kong has
      recently release their preliminary results on the use of SILS on appendicectomy with
      satisfactory results in terms of less post-operative pain and less prominent scar. However,
      it was a case series with limited number of patients. In order to test the advantages of
      SILS on the management of patients with acute appendicitis, a double blinded randomized
      clinical trial is conducted.

NCT01027455,Warm Humid Gas Insufflation for Appendix Removal by Minimally Invasive Surgery Warm Humid Insufflation for Appendix Removal by Minimally Invasive Surgery Trial (WARMIST),"
      In laparoscopic (key-hole) surgery, the use of cold dry carbon dioxide gas to inflate the
      abdominal cavity for the creation a clear operating field, results in damage to the cavity
      lining, known as the peritoneum. This has been associated with negative effects on
      post-operative recovery. Adult studies using warm humidified insufflation gas have indicated
      possible decreased post-operative pain, reduced narcotic analgesia requirements, decreased
      fogging of the laparoscopic camera lens, and reduced time to return to normal activities.
      Cold dry gas during laparoscopic surgery also has potential to cause abnormal decrease in
      body core temperature (hypothermia). This has been established by trials in adult humans and
      animal models. The WARMIST study aims to investigate for whether warm humid gas insuflation
      during laparoscopic removal of the appendix in children reduces intraoperative temperature
      variations, post-operative pain (indicated by morphine usage and pain scores), length of
      hospital stay and degree of camera lens fogging, and speed post-operative recovery compared

NCT01096927,Non Operative Treatment for Acute Appendicitis,"
      Case control studies that randomly assign patients to either surgical or non-surgical
      treatment yield a relapse rate of approximately 14% at one year. It would be useful to know
      the relapse rate of patients who have, instead, been selected for a given treatment based on
      a thorough clinical evaluation, including physical examination and laboratory results (all
      characteristics forming the Alvarado Score) as well as radiological exams if needed or
      deemed helpful. If this clinical evaluation is useful,the investigators would expect patient
      selection to be better than chance, and relapse rate lower than 14%. Once the investigators
      have established the utility of this evaluation, the investigators can begin to identify
      those components that have predictive value (such as blood chemistry analysis, or CT
      findings). This is the first step toward developing an accurate diagnostic-therapeutic
      algorithm which will avoid the risks and costs of needless surgery.

      This will be a single-cohort prospective interventional study. It will not interfere with
      the usual procedures, consisting of clinical examination in the Emergency Department (ED)
      and execution of the following exams at the physician's discretion: complete blood count
      with differential, C reactive protein, abdominal ultrasound, abdominal CT. Patients admitted

      hospital the surgery is only performed on adults as there is no pediatric ward. The surgical
      technique is primarily laparoscopic surgery, where the patients have their appendix removed
      while in general anaesthesia. During the last three years Bispebjerg hospital has had an
      average of 287 patients per year undergoing laparoscopic surgery. From January to the
      September 2012 a total of 211 patients have had the operation, with 29% having the operation
      performed during daytime, 48% in the evening and 22% at night. Open appendectomy is only
      performed in cases where laparoscopic surgery is impossible, this is often due to adhesions,
      scar tissue from former abdominal surgery or peritonitis. The scars from laparoscopic
      surgery are usually smaller than that from an open appendectomy, but it gives the patient
      three smaller scars divided on three abdominal quadrants instead of one larger scar on one

NCT02029781,The Laparoscopic Appendicitis Score; a Multicenter Validation Study,"
      SUMMARY

      Rationale: A diagnostic laparoscopy is a frequently used method to confirm the diagnosis
      appendicitis. However until recently evidence-based laparoscopic criteria for determining
      appendicitis were not defined. If there is any doubt about the presence of appendicitis the
      appendix is usually removed. In a single centre prospective pilot study on 134 patients the
      investigators were able to define the Laparoscopic APPendicitis (LAPP) score. In the current
      study the investigators will validate the LAPP score in order to decrease the negative
      appendectomy rate by 50%. Eventually the score should lead to a decrease in morbidity.

      Objective: To decrease the negative appendectomy rate by 50%.

      Study design: A multicenter prospective validation study

      Study population: All patients, ≥18 years, operated with a diagnostic laparoscopy for the
      clinical suspicion appendicitis. Sample size calculation, performed by a statistician/
      epidemiologist of the Trial Coordination Centre, showed the need to analyse 778 patients.

      Intervention (if applicable): Patients operated on appendicitis in 2008 and 2009 (n=843),
      were retrospectively analysed for negative appendectomies. This cohort will serve as the
      control group. In this control group no intervention was given, as the LAPP score was not
      yet defined.

      In the 778 prospective analysed patients, the LAPP score will be used during a diagnostic
      laparoscopy. With the LAPP score the investigators intend to halve the number of negative
      appendectomies.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: A decrease in the negative appendectomy rate from 9% to 5%.
      This decrease should not lead to an increase in missed appendicitis (occurring within 30
      days), defined as requiring a surgical re-intervention or as an appendicitis or appendicular
      infiltrate on an ultrasound or CT-scan.

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness: The risk of implementation of the LAPP score is minimal. In theory, the use of
      the LAPP score might lead to an increase risk in missed appendicitis. This might lead to an
      increase in morbidity.

NCT02047786,A Comparison of Appendicectomy Outcomes in Children Between Paediatric and General Surgical Centres in Scotland,"
      Introduction

      Appendicectomy (or appendectomy in US usage) is the single most commonly performed emergency
      surgical operation performed on British children. Previous investigation of outcomes
      following appendicectomy has suggested that specialist surgeons and high volume centres have
      fewer ""negative"" appendicectomies (i.e. the appendix found to be non-diseased), although
      there has not been consistent association found between hospital type or surgeon experience
      and complication rate or admission rate.

      Scotland has 3 dedicated children's surgery centres but straightforward children's surgery
      such as appendicectomy is also carried out in the country's general surgical centres.
      Appendicectomy outcome variations have not been explored in the Scottish National Health
      Service (NHS).

      Aim

      This study will compare appendicectomy outcomes in children between Scotland's specialist
      paediatric centres and general surgical centres.

      Methods

      This is a retrospective study of all appendicectomies performed in Scotland during the
      period from 1st January 2001 - 31st December 2010, on children aged 2 - 12 years old. It
      will use routinely collected administrative data from the Information Services Division of
      NHS National Services Scotland.

      The study will compare risk-adjusted 30 day/in-patient mortality, 30 day re-admission rate,
      30 day re-operation rate, post-operative length of stay and negative appendicectomy rates.

      The purpose of this study is determine the ability of bedide ultrasound performed in the
      Emergency Department and Outpatient Department can predict the severity of disease during a
      Dengue Fever outbreak in children, in Siem Reap, Cambodia. Our hypothesis is that the
      presence of gallbladder wall thickening and/or pleural effusions in children correlates with
      progression to Dengue hemorrhagic fever and Dengue shock. In addition, we hypothesize that
      sonographic imaging of pediatric patients presenting to the emergency department with a
      fever during a Dengue fever outbreak will change management and disposition.

NCT02137603,Fast Track Appendectomy for Suppurative Appendicitis,"
      The literature has reported that fast track surgery can be safely applied to children
      undergoing appendectomy for acute appendicitis. There is no current evidence regarding the
      application of same day discharge protocol in children with intra-operative findings of
      suppurative appendicitis. The current standard of care for patients who present with
      intra-operative findings of suppurative appendicitis includes post-operative admission and
      treatment with intravenous antibiotics. Patients are discharged home once they have met the
      following discharge criteria: temperature less than 38.5 degrees Celsius, pain control with
      oral pain medication, and tolerating a liquid diet. Given the evidence in the literature
      that has shown that same day discharge of patients with acute appendicitis is safe and
      effective, we propose that fast track surgery protocol can be safely applied to patients
      with intraoperative findings of suppurative appendicitis. We hypothesize that this will
      result in a decreased postoperative length of stay, without an increase in 30-day
      complication rate.

      treatment of appendicitis. To account for the child-family perspective and treatment
      preferences, the investigators will perform a study in which patients and their families
      choose between antibiotics alone (Non-operative group) or appendectomy (Surgery group) at
      ten U.S. hospitals. This study will determine the effectiveness of non-operative management
      of early appendicitis with antibiotics alone in children and compare differences in
      morbidity, disability, quality of life, satisfaction, and cost between families choosing
      surgery or non-operative management.

      1. Purpose and Objective: The purpose of this study is to test the feasibility of rapid
           acquisition of point of care 3D ultrasound for pediatric appendicitis. The study will
           use a newly developed acquisition method and post-processing technique to create three
           dimensional image models of the abdomen.

        2. Study activities and population group. The study population will be a convenience
           sample of patients 18 years and younger with suspected appendicitis, whose clinical
           care (unrelated to the study) includes ultrasound and/or CT of the abdomen. The study
           intervention includes acquisition of research ultrasound images, which will not be used
           for clinical care, and comparison of these images with clinically obtained images.
           Other clinical data such as surgical and pathology reports will also be reviewed. If
           not evident from the patient medical record, the final diagnosis will be confirmed by a
           telephone call to the subject 2 weeks after the initial visit.

        3. Data analysis and risk/safety issues. This is a pilot study intended to determine
           feasibility and to refine image reconstruction algorithms. Research images will be
           compared to clinical images to determine the frequency of visualization of the appendix
           and whether the appendix was deemed normal or abnormal. Comparison of research images
           with final diagnosis will also occur. The research intervention, an ultrasound exam,
           has no known safety risks. The only risk to subjects is loss of confidentiality.

      This study is observational, not interventional, because the experimental ultrasound will be
      performed in all subjects and will not be used in the clinical care of patients
      (consequently, will not have the opportunity to affect clinical outcomes). Experimental
      images will be reviewed after completion of clinical care and will not be provided to the
      clinicians caring for the subjects. We are not measuring the effect of the ultrasound

      with PFAPA could improve the health and daily of patients through reduction in febrile
      period frequency and length, along with concomitant reduction of associated symptoms.
      Current standard of care incorporates the administration of corticosteroids; however, while
      limiting the symptoms associated with PFAPA, corticosteroid use has been shown to increase
      the frequency at which these symptoms occur. Investigators hypothesize that administration
      of probiotics along with corticosteroids will work to decrease the frequency at which the
      febrile episodes occur. Additionally, probiotics may decrease the maximal fever experienced
      during these episodes, amount of corticosteroid needed to control the symptoms, average
      length of the episodes, and the number of patients who ultimately undergo tonsillectomy due

      Although appendicitis is the most common surgical emergency in children, its diagnosis
      remains a challenge and thus, emergency department (ED) providers increasingly rely on
      computed tomography to distinguish appendicitis from other conditions. This project (a) uses
      electronic health record (EHR) technology to deliver patient-specific clinical decision
      support to ED providers at the point of care, (b) assesses the impact of this intervention
      on the use of diagnostic imaging and clinical outcomes, and (c) assesses the impact of the
      intervention on the costs of care delivered. This innovative project will be a template for
      extending EHR-based clinical decision support to other domains of emergency care to
      ultimately improve a broad range of pediatric acute care outcomes.

      The proposed intervention, referred to as appy-CDS, is specifically designed for widespread
      use in EDs and could reduce reliance on advanced diagnostic imaging for pediatric and
      adolescent patients with acute abdominal pain while maintaining or improving clinical

      Diseases of the airways (bronchi) of the lungs include asthma and chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease (COPD), which are leading causes of reduced quality of life, loss of work,
      hospital admissions and deaths and result in a major economic burden to the patient and
      society. Worsening (exacerbation) of these conditions is common and is frequently due to
      viral or bacterial infection, which causes inflammation in the bronchi, i.e. bronchitis.
      Ways to objectively measure the inflammation are needed to improve diagnosis, cause and
      severity and to guide treatment. The investigators also need to understand changes in the
      body's defense (immune) mechanisms that make some patients have more frequent infective
      bronchitis.

      At present, sputum cell counts are able to identify different types of bronchitis, their
      severity and may be able to differentiate viral from bacterial infection. Other measurements
      in sputum, exhaled breath, blood and urine are also available to measure this inflammation.

      risk of acute exacerbations requiring hospitalization and 2) this elevated risk can be
      reduced with one simple intervention: access to a 1-800 Temple Call Center where patients
      can get immediate customized advice on managing COPD exacerbations in their early stages. We
      will test these beliefs in PA-SCOPE. The collaborators with Temple University Hospital on
      the PA-SCOPE project are Lancaster General Hospital, Western Pennsylvania Hospital, and the

NCT00788645,The Use of a Forecasting System for Predicting Exacerbations of COPD,"
      People with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) often have periods during the year
      when their symptoms become worse. These are often due to an infection and are called
      ""exacerbations"" by doctors. Exacerbations are more common in the winter and also seem to be
      related to particular types of weather. As well as forecasting the weather the UK Met Office
      has developed a system to try to predict when exacerbations are likely to occur. The main
      purpose of this research study is to find out whether the Met Office forecasting service can
      predict when exacerbations are more likely to occur and whether the advice given during the
      predicted higher risk periods leads to fewer patients having an exacerbation or if it
      reduces the impact of the exacerbation. The study will also assess if there is a link
      between viral or bacterial infection and breathing problems that occur during the study
      period. The study will also collect information about possible causes of the breathing
      problems and what happens to the person afterwards. The results of this study will help us
      learn more about breathing problems which may lead to new research studies that would aim to
      improve the care of people with COPD.

      Antibiotic therapy has been shown to be beneficial in patients with severe acute
      exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Although recent guidelines
      support the use of new antibiotics there is no evidence that newer antibiotics are any
      better than older agents. The choice of antibiotic to be used in this situation is
      challenging to the clinician who must choose between traditional antibiotics (cyclins,
      aminopénicillins, cotrimoxazole...) and new antimicrobial agents. Indeed, available
      comparative studies did not show an obvious superiority of new antibiotics compared to their
      predecessors . Taking into account bacterial agents associated to COPD exacerbations, one
      must choose an antibiotic which has the best activity against Haemophilus influenzae,
      Streptococcus pneumoniae and Branhamella catarrhalis. News quinolones are represented as an
      interesting alternative to standard antibiotics because of their large spectrum of action
      and of their pharmacokinetic advantages allowing high tissue penetration in the pulmonary
      parenchyma and tracheobronchial tree. Data on their use among patients having moderate
      exacerbation of COPD are encouraging but their effectiveness in more severe presentations is
      not established. The objective of this randomized controlled and double blind study is to
      evaluate the effectiveness and tolerance of ciprofloxacin compared to trimethoprim
      sulfamethoxazole in patients admitted to ICU for severe exacerbation of COPD requiring
      mechanical ventilation.

NCT00807469,Responses Induced by Smoking in Individuals Being Susceptible and Non-Susceptible for Development of COPD,"
      COPD is ranked number 3 by the WHO list of important diseases worldwide and is the only
      disease with increasing mortality. The pathogenesis of cigarette smoke-induced COPD is
      obscure, therefore more insight is needed to design effective anti-inflammatory agents. We
      hypothesize that healthy individuals who are susceptible to smoking demonstrate a higher and
      aberrant inflammatory response to cigarette smoke. This susceptibility is caused by
      heterogeneous factors and is associated with various polymorphic genes that interact with
      each other and with the environment.

      Objective:

        -  To define mediators involved in the early induction of COPD in susceptible smokers (and
           so to define new drug targets)

        -  To develop new biological and clinical markers for the early diagnosis and monitoring
           of COPD

      COPD exacerbations are characterized by an excessive accumulation and activation of
      inflammatory cells in the airways. It is not known whether this phenomenon represents a risk
      for for lung damage via the release in the extracellular environment of potent cytolitic
      cellular granular contents such as granzymes and perforin.

      The investigators assess the intracellular expression of granzymes and perforin in
      neutrophils and large granular lymphocytes (LGL) at the onset of exacerbations compared to
      stable disease.

      The investigators hypothesize that a greater release of intracellular perforin and granzymes
      from neutrophils and LGL into the extracellular environment occur at exacerbations compared
      to stable condition and that these changes are more pronounced in COPD patients than in
      subjects without COPD who undergo respiratory infection.

      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic progressive respiratory disorder
      causing disability with an increasing burden to the patient, his family and to the health
      services. Treatment of COPD patients depends on the stage of the disease. COPD responds
      poorly to corticosteroids, in spite of inflammation is a major component in its
      pathogenesis. A major barrier to therapy of COPD is resistance to the anti-inflammatory
      effects of corticosteroids. The molecular mechanisms for this corticosteroid resistance are
      now being elucidated, particularly as the molecular basis for the anti-inflammatory effects
      of corticosteroids is better understood (12). An important mechanism of corticosteroid
      resistance in COPD, which is also linked to amplification of the inflammatory process, is a
      reduction in the critical nuclear enzyme histone deacetylase (HDAC)2 . Since the major
      changes are at the level of small airways. We will examine the effect of addition of

      Cigarette smoking is the major risk factor for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD,
      commonly known as chronic bronchitis and emphysema). Despite this clear link, only 15-20% of
      smokers develop COPD suggesting that genetic factors affect the lung's susceptibility to the
      stress of cigarette smoke. The cells lining the airways (epithelium) and cells that help
      defend the lung (alveolar macrophages) of smokers develop gene expression changes that are
      different from that of nonsmokers. In the investigators' previous studies they have
      demonstrated that there are greater than 200 genes that are responsive to cigarette smoke in
      these cells. But the investigators do not know whether the gene expression is static or
      changes as a function of time. Genes that show significant changes over time may be relevant
      to the progression of the disease. Even though quitting smoking reduces the rate at which
      the lungs decline, many-smokers still go on to develop COPD. This study will provide
      insights into the natural history of smoking-related gene expression of the lung cells in

NCT01091493,Antibiotic or Not in Non-purulent Exacerbations of COPD: a Trial of Security and Efficacy,"
      COPD is one of the most important causes of morbidity and mortality and supposes a sanitary
      problem in Europe and USA. Patients with COPD usually have 1-2 episodes of acute
      exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD) per year, being these the principal causes of of
      hospitalizations, respiratory problems and medical visits. After an episode of AECOPD, the
      majority of patients develop a transitory (or permanent) worsening in their quality of life
      and 50% of them will require a new hospitalization. Globally, a 75%& of the exacerbations
      might be associated with a respiratory tract infection, and among them, 50% might be related
      to bacteria and in 45% an evidence of viral infection could be documented. Even though the
      antibiotic treatment might not be useful for a majority of patients with AECOPD, is
      generalized its use(almost an 85% in some series) in hospitalized patients. The
      non-controlled use of antibiotics in AECOPD results in a very expensive disease and raises
      the rate of resistance of bacteria. The available literature have shown that there's a
      relation between exacerbations and infections, based on sputum samples.

      In summary, is well known that at least a 50% of the episodes of AECOPD might be associated
      with pathogenic bacteria in the lower respiratory tract. Prescription of antibiotics is wide
      and generalized in hospitalized patients. Clinical trials have shown correlation between
      AECOPD with sputum purulence (which correlates with presence of bacteria), however they've
      not included NON-purulent AECOPD, even though they're a significative group of patients
      hospitalized by this cause too. It's necessary to evaluate the efficacy nor the security of

NCT01213693,Effects of Inhaled Corticosteroids on Sputum Bacterial Load in COPD,"
      Exacerbations are important events in the natural history of chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease (COPD). Beside the acute (and prolonged) clinical impact, there is evidence that
      exacerbations negatively affect the natural history of the disease; e.g. lung function
      decline is accelerated in patients with frequent exacerbations. Bacteria are considered the
      most relevant cause of exacerbations, but there is evidence that viral infections are
      equally contributing.

      Either alone or in combination with viruses, airway bacterial load in stable COPD correlates
      with both the frequency of exacerbations and the decline in lung function.

      A long-term clinical trial recently showed that the regular treatment with inhaled
      corticosteroids (ICS) increases the risk of infectious events such as pneumonia, whereas it
      reduces the frequency of acute COPD exacerbations in COPD.

      In a recent study it was found that airway bacterial load increases over time (1 yr follow
      up) in stable COPD. In this study, virtually all patients (93%) were treated with ICS.

      This study is designed to evaluate whether long-term (1 year) ICS treatment increases viral
      and/or bacterial load in the sputum of COPD patients.

NCT01232140,CRP-guided Antibiotic Treatment in COPD Exacerbations Admitted to the Hospital,"
      Rationale: Acute exacerbations are key events in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
      (COPD), resulting in poorer quality of life. Causes include irritants, viruses and bacterial
      pathogens. These exacerbations are often treated with a combination of corticosteroids,
      bronchodilators and antibiotics, but the benefit of antibiotic therapy remains
      controversial. Several trials studying antibiotic treatment in AECOPD showed conflicting
      data, with several large studies failing to demonstrate superiority of antibiotic therapy
      over placebo. Other trials indicated that antibiotic therapy is effective in patients who
      have at least two of the following symptoms: increased dyspnoea, increased sputum volume and
      increased sputum purulence. Ever since sputum purulence has been used as a predictive marker
      in AECOPD, a strategy that has been integrated in the GOLD guideline for treatment of
      AECOPD. However, the color of sputum reported by patients is not always reliable and
      inspection of sputum is not always possible. Several serum biomarkers such as C-reactive
      protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) are now available. In a recent trial of doxycycline in
      addition to systemic corticosteroids for patients hospitalized with AECOPD we found that CRP
      might be valuable as a marker predictive of response to antibiotic treatment in AECOPD.

NCT01248507,Predictive Questionnaires for Risk of Acute COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) Exacerbations,"
      COPD patients frequently suffer intermittent exacerbations of their disease characterised by
      acute deterioration of symptoms. Acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) are associated with
      significant impairment of health status, use of health care resources, poor prognosis and
      increased mortality. The development of simple and practical predictive tools would help to
      identify COPD patients at greater risk of suffering exacerbations, which is important since
      those patients would need more intense and early treatment.

NCT01252225,Lidocaine: Effect of Lidocaine in Chronic Cough,"
      People cough in order to clear their airways. Most coughs are caused by viruses and settle
      down by themselves, but some people develop persistent coughing which can be anywhere from 8
      weeks to several years. This is called chronic cough. People with chronic cough find the
      symptom distressing and it can have a major impact on their quality of life. Patients with
      chronic cough often report a sensation at the back of their throat which makes them feel an
      urge to cough. There is some evidence that Lidocaine (an anaesthetic used during medical
      procedures) can suppress a person's cough when given to patients via a nebuliser (a machine
      that turns liquid into a fine mist).

      It is currently unknown whether using a local anaesthetic, such as Lidocaine, in the form of
      a throat spray would successfully suppress a person's cough. A throat spray would be an
      easier treatment option in chronic cough patients. Thus, the investigators research aims to

NCT01254032,Predictive Ability of the Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Assessment Test (CAT) for Acute Exacerbations (PACE) in Patients With COPD,"
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a major health concern, with a substantial
      impact on a patient's life. However, the impact of COPD is currently under-recognised and,
      as a result, COPD is under-treated. An exacerbation of COPD is a major element that causes
      poor quality of life and loss of productivity. Therefore, minimizing the frequency of
      exacerbations is a short term treatment goal in COPD management and could improve Quality of
      Life (QoL) significantly in all severity groups of COPD.

      Although the use of spirometry for the determination of disease severity in COPD is
      supported by guidelines, a lung function test alone does not provide a measurement of the
      overall impact of COPD on health status and is not generally available especially in primary
      care centre. Therefore, a standardised and effective dialogue between patients and
      physicians in a consultation could address the impact of COPD on a patient's QoL in this
      situation.

      The COPD Assessment Test (CAT), recently launched in 2009, is a short and simple,
      self-administered questionnaire designed to assess the condition of patients and overall
      impact of COPD, and to improve patient-physician communication. It has been proven that the
      CAT has good repeatability and discriminative properties which suggest that it is sensitive
      to treatment effects at a group level. The CAT score with its better ability to assess the
      impact of COPD on patients, suggests potential to predict a significant change in COPD
      status such as acute exacerbations of COPD.

      Since the CAT is designed to assess the impact of COPD on the patient by measuring overall
      impairment, it has better correlations with other instruments, such as the Clinical COPD
      Questionnaire (CCQ), MRC (Medical Research Council) dyspnoea scale, St George's Respiratory
      Questionnaire (SGRQ),and the 6-minute walk test. However, it does not correlate well with
      FEV1 (Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second).

      While the CAT shares some similarities with other questionnaires, there are several
      important differences. For example, the SGRQ is substantially longer than the CAT, is
      complex to administer and requires the use of a computer for scoring. The CAT is designed to
      provide a holistic measure of the impact of COPD on the patient, whereas the MRC dyspnoea
      scale only measures dyspnoea, and the CCQ only assesses clinical disease control. Thus, the
      CAT is the only validated, short and simple assessment test which can provide a holistic
      measure of the impact of COPD on patients, ensuring both the physicians and the patients
      gain the understanding needed to manage COPD optimally.

      QoL is defined as an individual's perception of their position in their life in the context
      of the culture and value systems. Therefore, the extent of understanding of the
      questionnaire might be influenced by language and ethnicities. Since the validation findings
      so far have been based on data from the US and Europe, PACE may provide better quality of
      data across ethnic groups given that mainly Asian subjects will participate in this study.

      PACE is designed to evaluate whether the CAT has a high predictive value in detecting
      subsequent exacerbations of COPD. If so, this result might enable both patients and
      physicians to better target and optimise management. The primary objective is to evaluate
      the predictability of the CAT to have subsequent exacerbations in COPD patients. Secondary
      objectives are to evaluate the predictability of the CAT to have moderate to severe
      exacerbations or time to the first exacerbation, to identify risk predictors for COPD
      exacerbations, and to evaluate correlations between CAT scores and FEV1 values, or MRC
      dyspnea scores. An experimental objective is to evaluate the correlation between the CAT
      score between 2 consecutive follow-ups (e.g. Week 8 & baseline, Week 16 & Week 8) and a COPD
      exacerbation over the following treatment period adjusting for demographics, MRC scores,
      lung function parameters, medical history, and therapy history.

      PACE is a multicentre, prospective, observational study designed to evaluate the
      predictability of the CAT score to have COPD exacerbations over 24 weeks. During the study,
      subjects continue taking their regular prescribed treatment. Investigators are free to make
      medication adjustments where required. Eligible subjects will have a clinic visit every 8
      weeks, during which they will complete the CAT questionnaire, the Exacerbation Check List
      (ECL), MRC dyspnea scale, and spirometry. A regular phone call is placed every 8 weeks in
      between clinic visits to collect data for the ECL.There is no follow-up period.

      550 male and female outpatient subjects will be recruited for PACE to obtain approximately
      300 exacerbation events. This study will capture the winter periods in Australia, China,
      Korea and Taiwan, when incidence of exacerbations is at its peak.

      Patients with moderate COPD as defined by GOLD guidelines constitute almost 46% to 54% of
      all diagnosed COPD patients. Yet limited data exists on characterizing this study population
      in terms of drug therapy patterns and COPD-related resource use and costs. The objective of
      the following study was to conduct an analysis in the real-world setting to (1) identify and
      characterize COPD patients with moderate exacerbations and (2) evaluate the impact of
      initiating different maintenance therapies in this population. Maintenance therapy
      medications include inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), long-acting beta agonists (LABAs),
      combination of ICS+LABA, and anticholinergics (ACs) including tiotropium (TIO) and
      ipratropium or combination ipratropium-albuterol (collectively referred to as ipratropium

      The timing of initiating short-term treatment for COPD exacerbations with oral
      corticosteroids and/or antibiotic therapy has been shown to influence the recovery time of
      exacerbations with early initiation of exacerbation therapy having a faster symptom recovery
      compared to delayed initiation. While oral corticosteroids and/or antibiotic therapy are
      crucial for immediate exacerbation therapy, maintenance therapy with controller medications
      for COPD has been recommended to reduce the risk of future exacerbations. The initiation of
      maintenance therapy after a COPD exacerbation has been shown to be beneficial in the
      reduction of risk of future exacerbations. However, there is a lack of information on
      whether the timing of this initiation influences the risk of future exacerbations. The
      following study evaluates the impact of early versus delayed initiation of controller
      medication therapy for maintenance treatment following a COPD-related exacerbation on
      outcomes of future exacerbations and costs in patients with COPD.

NCT01694069,Continuous Infusion Piperacillin-tazobactam for the Treatment of Cystic Fibrosis,"
      Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disorder leading to chronic pulmonary inflammation and
      infection. A majority of people with cystic fibrosis have large quantities of bacteria
      residing in their lungs. One of the most common and harmful bacteria is called Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa.

      Patients with cystic fibrosis require frequent therapy with intravenous (I.V.) antibiotics
      to treat lung infections thought to be caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. One of the
      antibiotics frequently used to treat this bacteria is piperacillin-tazobactam.
      Piperacillin-tazobactam is thought to be the most effective when there is a constant level
      of drug in the body. The standard way to administer piperacillin-tazobactam is to give
      several grams 4 times each day as a 30 minute infusion. An alternative way to give
      piperacillin-tazobactam is by a continuous infusion; a continuous infusion will make it more
      likely that drug will remain at a constant level in the body. The objective of this study is
      to determine if administering piperacillin-tazobactam as a continuous infusion is more
      effective at treating people having a pulmonary exacerbation of cystic fibrosis than a
      standard 30 minute infusion, 4 times a day.

NCT01701869,Microbiology & Immunology of the Chronically-inflamed Airway,"
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth most common cause of death and
      the only one of the common causes that is still rising. The main effects of the disease are
      the destruction and inflammation of lung tissue rendering breathing difficult. COPD has
      significant effects on the quality of life of sufferers and the disease is predicted to be
      the fifth most common cause of disability in the world by 2020. Patients with COPD are prone
      to periods of worsening disease symptoms, known as exacerbations, which are often caused by
      viral and bacterial infections of the lung and current vaccines appear to have little
      efficacy in limiting these exacerbations. The loss of lung function caused by infectious
      exacerbations is irreversible and patients who frequently exacerbate experience more rapid
      disease progression. Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) is a major bacterial species
      that colonises the airways and causes exacerbations in COPD. With the development of more
      sensitive molecular techniques it has been possible to ascertain that it is the acquisition
      of new strains of NTHi that correlate strongly with exacerbations. However, not all patients
      with COPD have NTHi in their lungs and the question remains as to why some COPD patients are
      susceptible to such infections. This study aims to answer this question by comparing the
      airways of COPD patients who are colonized by NTHi and those who are not to analyse whether
      the levels of protective antibodies in the lungs and the function of the immune cells in the
      NTHi colonized airway are reduced. Moreover, we aim to correlate this reduction in immunity
      with areas of lung damage ascertained by high resolution computed tomography. The aim of
      this research is to better understand this apparent deficiency in airway immunity as this is
      likely to impact on vaccine efficacy in COPD.

      Title: Pro-to-COLD, Procalcitonin to Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease,

      COLD: Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease, Regarding: Patients hospitalized with suspected
      acute exacerbation of COPD + / - pneumonia.

      Background: Patients with COPD exacerbation often get antibiotics. There is considerable
      criticism of this, many of these patients are not bacterially infected and the antibiotics
      overconsumption can lead to resistance development and side effects.

      The purpose: To show that one can reduce the consumption of antibiotics among patients
      hospitalized for worsening of COPD disease in a population of Danish COPD patients by giving
      antibiotics depending on the value of the biomarker procalcitonin measured in the blood. A
      sub-objective is a validation study of mini VIDAS ® / Biomérieux equipment to the current
      gold standard in measuring procalcitonin, Kryptor/ BRAHMS.

      Subjects: All patients with confirmed/suspected COPD admitted with COPD exacerbation to the
      Acute Admissions Unit/ Pulmonary dept. in weekdays. Participants must be adults and be of
      age and there must be a signed informed consent.

      Method: 1) Controlled (Quasi-randomized): Even and uneven (concealed) digit of patient´s
      danish personal identification number, not last digit (gender-fixed) (CPR-number). Even =
      procalcitonin-guided, Uneven = Control.

      2) Collect and analyze procalcitonin (PCT)-samples of patients in the PCT group at admission
      and then every 2 day. Samples analyzed throughout the week: Vital Status looked up 28 days
      after inclusion. Create a biobank in the study consisting of blood à 8 ml up to a maximum of
      4 times taken for PCT measurements, the subsequent validation study of MiniVIDAS ®. Biobank
      destroyed 15 years after the completed project.

      Statistical considerations:

        1. Sample size / Sample Size:

           A total of 120 patients (please see the basis for this estimate of the Protocol).

        2. Analyze:

      A) Antibiotics stopped on day 5 B) Defined Daily Doses Reads aloud, 1) narrow spectrum, 2)
      broad spectrum, and 3) a total of the two groups between the (Mann-Whitney U test) C)
      Hospitalization within 28 days after the first hospitalization the year - the two groups
      between (Mann-Whitney U test). Doctor Jens-Ulrik Jensen stands for analyzes. Statistics
      program ""SAS v. 9.1.3"" is used.

      Economics: The study funded by the participating departments.

      Responsibility: The study was conceived and run by doctors in Pulmonary Medicine Department
      and Department of Clinical Pharmacology, both Bispebjerg Hospital and Department of Clinical
      Microbiology, Hvidovre Hospital.

      Science Ethics: There has been a thorough research ethics discussion of the project in the
      project with emphasis on an assessment of the advantages and disadvantages that might be for
      the participating patients and society as a whole now and in the future. Conclusions A and B
      of this discussion is summarized as:

      A. Advantages and Disadvantages: The treating physician has at any time the opportunity to
      start / continue antibiotic behandlling for the overall assessment whether PCT value. In
      addition, in the past, in large studies with a total of> 2000 patients, demonstrated that
      there are drawbacks to the use of antibiotics depending on a displayed value of PCT in
      patients hospitalized with acute exacerbations of COPD. Mortality and hospitalization will
      be monitored in this study. However, there may occur side effects to blood sampling, usually
      transient ecchymosis blood sampling site. If the strategy results in a reduced consumption
      of antibiotics, it is expected that the incidence of antibiotic-associated adverse events
      decreased - this for the benefit of the patient.

      B. Usefulness for society: Based on the results from this study will be a high degree of
      certainty to conclude whether this new treatment strategy can provide benefits for future
      patients in the form of reduced antibiotic consumption, less antibiotic associated adverse
      events, reduced resistance development / selection among bacteria and overall lower economic
      costs. Based on these considerations, believes the project, the project can be carried out
      with respect for the participating subjects to integrity.

      Quantity: It is expected to be included 120 patients in this scientific study. Database:
      data (case report forms) stored in archive of Pulmonary Medicine Department for 15 years.
      Create a database with the information. Personally identifiable data will only be present in
      the clinical hospital. During the completion of the experiment can provide essential health
      information about the subject's state of health. This will the subject be informed, unless
      clearly opted out of this on the consent form. The project reported to the Data Protection

      -  Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is characterized by lung hyperinflation
           and flow limitation. These physiopathological modifications are secondary to loss of
           elastic recoil and bronchial obstruction due to emphysema.

        -  The cornerstone of COPD treatment is represented by inhaled beta-2 agonists and
           anticholinergics. The molecules of the latter classes can be characterized by short
           lasting action (few hours), long acting action (12 hours) or ultra long acting duration
           of action (24 hours).

        -  For years the only anticholinergic (or antimuscarinic) drug other than those used by
           aerosol, was Tiotropium Bromide. Recently two new antimuscarinic agents have been
           launched on the market: glycopyrronium bromide (once daily) and aclidinium (twice
           daily).

        -  The Single Breath Nitrogen Test is capable of identifying the pulmonary closing volume.
           The part of the curve that reflects lung ventilation inhomogeneity is the slope of
           phase III

        -  For COPD patients, the most important characteristic for an inhalatory drug is a prompt
           action in order to give a quick relief from respiratory symptoms, in particular
           dyspnoea.

        -  The objective of this study is to study the acute action of glycopyrronium and
           aclidinium in terms of reduction of hyperinflation, pulmonary specific resistances,
           lung volume distribution and dyspnoea at rest in severe COPD patients.

NCT02386735,Reduction of Corticosteroid Use in Outpatient Treatment of Exacerbated COPD,"
      Background

      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major public health issue with no curative
      treatment. In Switzerland estimated 5-7% of the total population are suffering from this
      chronic disease. According to current guidelines corticosteroids are part of treatment of
      acute exacerbations in COPD patients. Several studies suggest that corticosteroids
      accelerate the recovery of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), decrease duration of
      hospitalization, reduce treatment failure rate and improve clinical outcome. The additional
      therapeutic benefit on FEV1-recovery tough seems only to last for three to five days. The
      investigators recently published a hospital-based study showing that in patients presenting
      to emergency departments with acute exacerbation of COPD, a short five day treatment with
      systemic steroids was not inferior to a conventional 14 day treatment with regard to
      re-exacerbation. Cumulative corticosteroid dose could be reduced in this trial. To the
      investigators knowledge no data is available about the minimal necessary corticosteroid dose
      in an outpatient treatment setting so far.

      Aim

      The primary aim of this study is to investigate in an outpatient setting, whether a three
      day treatment with orally administered systemic corticosteroids is non-inferior to a five
      day treatment in acute exacerbation of COPD and if total glucocorticoid exposure can be
      reduced by shorter therapy.

      Hypothesis

      The investigators postulate, that in an outpatient setting, where generally less severe
      exacerbations are being treated, a three day treatment duration of systemic corticosteroids
      should be non-inferior to a five day treatment duration with regard to treatment benefits
      but decrease cumulative corticosteroid exposure.

      Design and Setting

      This study is going to be performed as a prospective, randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, non-inferiority trial in an outpatient setting. Randomization will be
      performed as block randomization with a 1:1 allocation. The investigators are going to
      recruit GPs in northwestern and central Switzerland.

      Methods

      The investigators are going to include patients presenting to GP's with acute exacerbation
      of COPD. When matching the investigators eligibility criteria and written informed consent
      is given, patients included in the study are receiving systemic corticosteroid treatment
      (equivalent of 40mg prednisone daily) for either five days (conventional arm) or three days
      (interventional arm) followed by two days of placebo for the interventional group.
      Pre-randomized, identically looking, numbered blisters are given to all patients included in
      the study. Antibiotic treatment (Amoxicillin/Clavulanic acid, 625mg 3/d, for ten days) is
      given to all patients with a CRP ≥50mg/l, COPD and known diagnosis of bronchiectasis, as
      well as patients presenting with all three of the following symptoms: change of baseline
      dyspnea, change of sputum quantity and sputum purulence. Further initial treatment and
      steroid treatment after inclusion is determined and documented by the GP. Patients will
      undergo follow-up visits at day three and seven by their GP as well as follow-up phone calls
      executed by the study center at day 30, 90 and 180.

NCT02619903,The Oral Microbiota as Reservoir for Systemic Opportunistic Pathogens,"
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and gastric ulcer both get infected via or from
      the oropharyngeal tissues and have antibiotics in their treatment regimen of both diseases.
      This proposal suggests that the oral microbiome, in particularly dental plaque, is a
      plausible source of reinfection of COPD and gastric ulcer.

      Subjects with COPD or gastric ulcer are randomized to an adjunctive dental cleaning or no
      dental treatment. Both groups undergo the regular treatment for their respective diseases.
      Both groups have a full dental examination and have salivary microbiota as well as dental
      plaque harvested.

      The primary outcome variables is COPD exacerbations and new gastric ulcer event, and the
      secondary outcome variable re-colonization of the stomach and lung.

      Given that the study shows that additional dental cleaning does have an impact on
      reinfection of gastric ulcer and COPD it implies that dental cleaning should be subsidized
      when treating these diseases. This would have a significant impact on restricting antibiotic
      resistance as both H. pylori infections and COPD are treated with antibiotics. Both diseases
      also cause personal suffering and consequently disables the person to work, which causes
      financial consequences, and of course healthcare expenses.

NCT00625053,Functional Outcome After Incisional Hernia Repair: Open Versus Laparoscopic Repair,"
      Background: Midline incisional hernia is reported from 0,5 to 11% after abdominal
      operations. Primary repair without mesh reinforcement is almost abandoned because of high
      recurrence rates (24 to 46%). Use of prosthetic mesh in incisional hernia repair lowered the
      recurrence rates under 10%. Recurrence rate alone is not the main quality criterion for
      incisional hernia repair anymore. Large series and meta-analyses confirmed the value of
      laparoscopic repair as at least equal if not better compared with open repair. Discomfort,
      pain, diminished quality of life and body image alteration influences functional well being.
      No baseline information exists in any of these fields treating pre- or post-operative phases
      in patients with incisional hernia. Respiratory functions and medico-economic evaluation are
      other rarely investigated fields that we consider in our trial. The objective of this study
      is to analyse the functional outcome status of patients after laparoscopic incisional hernia
      repair compared to open repair.

      Methods: A randomized controlled non-blinded clinical trial is designed to compare
      laparoscopic incisional hernia mesh repair with open repair on post operative pain, health
      related quality of life outcomes, body image and cosmetic measurements, respiratory

      Background: Although there are some comparative studies between laparoscopy and
      hand-assisted laparoscopic splenectomy (HALS) in splenomegaly cases, there is no study of
      the differences between HALS and open splenectomy (OS). Our aim was to compare the HALS and

      Methods: This prospective study included 27 patients undergoing splenectomy for splenic
      disorders at the Department of General Surgery, Istanbul Medical Faculty between February
      2007 and October 2007. OS was performed on 14 patients, and HALS was performed in the other

NCT00769873,Anticoagulation Post Laparoscopic Splenectomy,"
      Splenic/portal vein thrombosis is an alarming complication of splenectomy. Retrospective
      studies in the literature have shown the incidence of symptomatic splenic/portal vein
      thrombosis to be between 0.7% (Rattner et al., 1993) to 8% (Winslow et al., 2002). This is a
      single-center, prospective, randomized study in subjects undergoing laparoscopic
      splenectomy. All participants will receive one dose of pre-operative low molecular weight
      heparin (Lovenox®) subcutaneously, 2 hours prior to surgery. Participants will be randomized
      pre-operatively to treatment or control group however the treatment allocation will not be
      revealed until the surgery is complete. Postoperatively, those assigned to the treatment
      group will receive 40 mg of Lovenox® subcutaneously once a day for 21 days; those in the
      control group will not. Patients with severe renal impairment will receive an adjusted dose
      of Lovenox® (30 mg subcutaneous dose daily). All patients will have a baseline abdominal
      Doppler ultrasound preoperatively and a second one done at 14 to 28 days post surgery to
      monitor for the presence of portal vein and/or splenic vein thrombosis. They will also have
      their lipase and liver function tests checked to correlate with the imaging findings.

NCT00778362,Splenic Function After Spleen-Preserving Distal Pancreatectomy With Excision of Splenic Artery and Vein,"
      The spleen may be removed due to benign hematologic disorders, such as idiopathic
      thrombocytopenic purpura and hereditary spherocytosis, or malignancies, such as lymphomas
      and leukemias. Splenectomy may also be performed due to splenic traumas or in association of
      some surgical procedures, when combined splenectomy will make the operations easier. The
      most well known procedure is distal pancreatectomy combined with splenectomy.

      In this research, there are two main goals. Firstly, establish the data about the incidence
      of overwhelming postsplenectomy infection (OPSI) in our country. Currently, the western data
      of the incidence, morbidity rate and mortality rate of OPSI is well established and
      vaccination along with prophylactic antibiotics is strongly recommended. Since the incidence
      of OPSI in our country isn't clear, most (>95%) splenectomized patients in our hospital
      (National Taiwan University Hospital) did not have vaccination or prophylactic antibiotics.
      We'll try to determine the incidence of OPSI by reviewing of our hospital charts and by
      structured interviews with patients.

      The spleen is a phagocytic filter. So asplenic patients have higher risks of getting
      infection and some spleen-preserving procedures are proposed. In our initial experiences,
      distal pancreatectomy with splenic artery and vein divided could be safely performed and
      greatly increased the possibility of preservation of spleen. However, when the spleen was
      preserved with dividing the splenic artery and vein, the blood supply to the spleen will be
      shifted from splenic artery to short gastric artery. Although a substantial immunologic
      advantage exists if splenic tissue remains, this may not offer sufficient protection from
      encapsulated bacteria if splenic arterial blood flow is reduced because experimental animal
      studies have demonstrated that an intact splenic arterial system is necessary for optimal
      control of infection. Thus, although the spleen is preserved in above mentioned procedure,
      the function of the preserved spleen is questionable and has never been studied of. Our
      second object is to determine the splenic function after after spleen-preserving distal
      pancreatectomy with excision of splenic artery and vein by comparison of abdominal computed
      tomography and immunological function of patients before and after operation. Besides, we'll
      designed an animal experiment to examine the rate of pneumococcal clearance by the spleen
      and to determine the relationship between splenic blood flow and splenic tissue mass in
      bacterial clearance from the blood when the splenic vessels were divided.

NCT00950625,Intraperitoneal Analgesia After Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy,"
      Although laparoscopic cholecystectomy is associated with less pain than contemporary open
      procedures; it is definitely not pain free and the magnitude of postoperative shoulder and
      abdominal pain in the early postoperative period is still quite significant. This
      postoperative pain is a major concern not only for the patients, but also healthcare
      workers; and it often contributes to overnight hospital stay after this minimally invasive
      surgical procedure. Intraperitoneal instillation of local anesthetics at the time of surgery
      to control pain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy has been extensively studied in numerous
      randomized trials and found to be extremely useful. Lignocaine and Bupivacaine are two
      commonly used local anesthetic agents. In view of contradictory results from previous
      studies, it is not yet clear which of these two agents is superior to the other for pain
      control in this setting. To answer this question, we have designed a prospective randomized
      controlled trial and the specific aim of the study is to compare the analgesic efficacy of
      intraperitoneal lignocaine with intraperitoneal Bupivacaine in the postoperative setting
      after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

      If we can improve pain control after this minimally invasive procedure, it might result in
      decreased postoperative requirement of narcotic analgesia and its associated side-effects.
      It may also result in early recovery and the same day discharge of the patients with
      significant cost-containment for the patient and healthcare systems in future.

      At present, CT is the gold standard in the assessment of patients with acute abdomen. Yet,
      one CT of the abdomen exposes patients to a radiation dose equivalent to several years of
      background radiation. MR can be expected to yield the same information without ionizing
      radiation, but tends to be more time consuming. In this study, patients with nontraumatic
      acute abdominal pain referred to CT of the abdomen by the department of surgery will also
      have performed an additional MR scan covering the entire abdomen with few fast imaging
      sequences in approximately 15min. CT is the diagnostic test. The MR scan is only used for
      scientific purposes. It will be evaluated by a radiologist blinded for the results of the CT
      scan. Fourteen days after admission, a final diagnosis is established based on clinical,
      peroperative, pathological and lab. findings. The performance of CT and MR will then be

NCT01412684,Distal Pancreatectomy With Partial Splenectomy for Pancreatic Tumors,"
      Most resectable tumors arising in the body or tail of the pancreas are malignancies or
      premalignancies which are surgically treated with distal pancreatectomy in combination with
      splenectomy. Retrieval of the lymph node tissue which lies along the splenic vessels is
      necessary to complete an oncologically sound operation. Two techniques for spleen preserving
      distal pancreatectomy have been described, but only a small number of lesions are amenable
      to spleen preserving pancreas surgery because these operation compromise oncologic
      principles. Removal of a normal spleen usually does not cause immediate consequences but can
      make patients vulnerable to life threatening infections. Asplenic patients must be vigilant
      for these infections and antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended anytime a fever occurs.
      Splenectomy results in measurable changes in the cellular components of the blood. If
      thrombocytosis occurs as a result of splenectomy, it requires life-long antiplatelet
      treatment.

      Some childhood hematologic disorders such as hereditary spherocytosis are successfully
      treated with partial splenectomy. The post-surgical remnant spleen has been shown to be
      viable and functional. Both hematologic and immunologic function of the spleen seems to be
      preserved in most patients. Partial splenectomy has also been successful ly employed to
      treat benign and malignant lesions of the spleen. Unfortunately these indications for
      surgery are rare and so the experience with partial splenectomy is small.

      To date, distal pancreatectomy with partial splenectomy has not been described in the
      medical literature. The investigators have devised a surgical procedure combining distal
      pancreatectomy with partial splenectomy, in principal allowing preservation of splenic
      function without compromise of oncologic principles. This procedure is possible now because
      of new technology which allows for near bloodless transection of solid organs. These
      instruments are routinely used in liver, kidney and pancreas surgery. There are scattered
      reports of successful use of these instruments in splenic transection, but there is no large
      experience to date.

      The study intends to answer the question, is the proposed procedure, distal pancreatectomy
      and partial splenectomy, a viable alternative to the current standard of care, distal
      pancreatectomy with total splenectomy, for patients who will undergo surgical treatment of
      pancreas lesions arising in the body or tail of the pancreas?

      with Philadelphia negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). These include polycythemia
      vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and myelofibrosis.

      Portal vein thrombosis and portal hypertension are serious complications that are often seen
      in myeloproliferative patients. These complications are usually diagnosed when patients
      become symptomatic, and are often already at an advanced stage. They can further progress to
      cause non-reversible damage to the liver, also called cirrhosis of the liver. As a result of
      this, patients often accumulate fluid in the abdomen which is ascites; and can develop
      swelling of veins in the lining of the esophagus known as varices. If untreated, varices
      have the risk of rupturing resulting in life-threatening bleeding. When diagnosed at an
      advanced stage, the treatment is usually supportive therapy and there are no treatments
      available at present which can reverse these conditions.

      This study is looking at screening for these two conditions using Doppler ultrasound and

NCT01828749,Pelvic CT Imaging in Blunt Abdominal Trauma,"
      Abdominopelvic CT (CTap) utilization rose significantly in blunt trauma patients over the
      last decade. However, the observed increases failed to reduce mortality or missed injury
      rates. Several investigators have derived (citation) and validated (citation) clinical
      decision rules that attempt to identify a subset of low risk pediatric and adult patients in
      whom abdominopelvic CT imaging can be safely eliminated. Thus far these efforts failed to
      significantly reduce utilization. The investigators propose an alternative and complimentary
      strategy to decrease radiation by selectively eliminating the pelvic imaging portion of the
      abdominopelvic CT in low risk patients. In stable, alert patients without clinically
      evidence of pelvis or hip fractures, abdominal CT imaging alone (diaphragm to iliac crest)
      identifies clinically significant intra-abdominal injury (cs-IAI) as accurately as routine
      abdominopelvic imaging (diaphragm to greater trochanter) and results in a clinically
      important decrease in radiation exposure. The study will investigate this by comparing the
      accuracy of an imaging protocol using CT abdomen alone versus CT abdomen and pelvis to
      detect cs-IAI among stable, blunt trauma patients without suspected pelvis or hip fractures
      in two age groups: ages 3-17 years and 18-60. Patients will undergo CT imaging as deemed
      clinically indicated by the treating clinician. Among those who have abdominopelvic CT
      scans, the study will determine the test characteristics of CT abdomen alone versus CT
      abdomen plus CT pelvis imaging for the identification of cs-IAI. The reference standard will
      include initial radiology reports, with structured follow up of indeterminate scans,
      operative reports, and 7-day medical record review.

NCT01911702,Different Fluidic Strategy in Patients With Acute Abdomen : The Sure Volume,"
      Acute abdomen is the clinical manifestation of irritation of the peritoneum, due to
      intra-abdominal generalized infection. With the exception of the primary ones which are the
      result of a bacterial translocation from the gastro-intestinal tract or an abdominal
      contamination for hematogenous way sometimes treatable with medical therapy alone,
      peritonitis represents a complex condition that requires an early surgical treatment.

      Mortality linked to the peritonitis is extremely high and variable between 42% and 80% when
      associated with a systemic framework of severe sepsis. This variability is linked to a
      number of risk factors, including advanced age of the patients, the presence of comorbidity,
      male sex, a poor nutritional status, and a number of re-operations; as well as specific
      characteristics related to the type of infection, the timing of surgery, the beginning of an
      appropriate and early antibiotic therapy.The post-operative treatment of the patient with
      peritonitis significantly affects the outcome of the same. The presence of peritonitis and
      then the seizure of large volumes of liquids and the possible state of systemic vasodilation
      induced by the infectious process, provide a framework of hypovolemia. There is a literature

NCT02140710,Impact of Visceral Osteopathic Treatment on Meconium Evacuation in Preterm Infants,"
      Timing of the first and last meconium stool is critical for oral feeding tolerance and
      proper gastrointestinal function. The time until premature infants pass their first meconium
      ranges from 1 hour to 27 days (median: 43 hours). Obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract
      by tenacious, sticky meconium frequently leads to gastric residuals, a distended abdomen and
      delayed food passage Recent data support the concept that complete rapid evacuation of
      meconium plays a key role in feeding tolerance . If duration to full enteral feedings is
      extended, the probability to acquire infections due to intravenous access for parenteral
      nutrition increases and hospital stay of the infant prolongates. Previously two prospective
      trials focusing on the problem of delayed meconium evacuation in preterm with different
      therapeutic pharmacological approaches were published by our group. None of the applied
      therapies appeared to be effective or had a beneficial effect- quite the contrary one agent
      (Gastrografin) was supposed to have severe negative side effects. Therefore we were looking
      for an alternative, non-invasive, holistic solution for the problem of delayed meconium
      excretion. Osteopathic treatment with the emphasis on the relationship of the structural and
      functional integrity of the body and with its variety of therapeutic manual techniques
      seemed to be remedy. Treating the abdomen of premature infants with visceral osteopathic
      techniques might be more effective to mobilize meconium from small bowel and deep parts of
      the colon. Therefore we hypothesized that repeated visceral osteopathic treatment
      accelerates meconium evacuation in premature infants, and thereby enhances feeding tolerance
      in this population.

NCT02149472,Towards Better Prognostic and Diagnostic Strategies for Haemostatic Changes During Major Obstetric Haemorrhage,"
      Major obstetric haemorrhage (MOH) remains a cause of significant maternal morbidity and
      mortality worldwide. By identifying women with a higher a priori risk of major haemorrhage
      during their pregnancy or early during postpartum haemorrhage extra measures to prevent MOH
      can be taken.

      In this study the investigators aim to identify haemostatic parameters that during the
      course of haemorrhage are responsible for the on-going towards major bleeding. By doing
      this, cut-off points can be defined for future interventions aiming to stop this bleeding
      process in an early stage. Traditional coagulation parameters are currently not useful for
      clinical decision making, because of long turn around times. Therefore the added value of
      available coagulation 'point of care' tests will be evaluated during obstetric
      haemorrhage.These Point-of-Care (POC) tests could lead to a goal-directed haemostatic
      therapy for obstetric haemorrhage.

      A cohort of 9.500 pregnant women will be followed during their pregnancy and delivery. From
      all women a bleeding score will be obtained during their pregnancy by means of a validated
      questionnaire. The predictive value of this bleeding score for the occurrence of major
      obstetric haemorrhage will be evaluated.

      If postpartum haemorrhage develops (blood loss) > 1000 cc, blood samples will be drawn for
      conventional haemostatic parameters and ROTEM profiles. The pathway between minor bleeding
      and major bleeding will be elucidated. Interchangeability and comparability of conventional
      haemostatic parameters and ROTEM profiles will also be evaluated.

      The overall goal of the investigators is becoming more able to predict major obstetric
      haemorrhage in an early stage of postpartum haemorrhage and define thresholds for
      goal-directed hemostatic therapies.

NCT02378311,Handlebar Grip Related Injury Prevention (GRIP) Study: Are Exposed Metal Handlebar Ends a Risk Factor for Injury?,"
      Cycling injuries are the 3rd most common mechanism of injury in 7-13 year olds[1]. Bicycle
      injuries have remained one of the commonest causes of paediatric abdominal trauma for over
      60 years[2,3]. 15% of child cyclist injuries involve impact with a handlebar; two-thirds of
      those are abdominal injuries[4]. Handlebar impact is now the commonest mechanism of major
      paediatric abdominal injury[3]. Serious handlebar injuries often occur after apparently
      minor falls; they are not unique to riders performing stunts[5].

      One small study found that the metal handlebar ends were often exposed on bikes of children
      sustaining severe abdominal injuries[6]. Most European safety standards do not test grip
      durability[7-10]. Day-to-day use can damage rubber grips, exposing the underlying metal
      handlebar tube.

      This feasibility study aims to test the research methods that will be used in a subsequent
      nationwide multicentre study. The main study will investigate the association between
      injuries and handlebar grip condition.

      Children attending study hospitals with any bicycle or kick scooter injury will be invited
      to participate. Parents of injured children will be invited to complete questionnaires
      regarding circumstances surrounding the injury and condition of the handlebar ends on the
      bike or scooter involved. Clinical information regarding the injury will also be collected.
      The handlebar end condition will be compared between children sustaining a handlebar end
      injury [Cases] and riders whose injury did not involve the handlebar [Controls].

      If exposed handlebar ends are more prevalent amongst riders with handlebar end injuries,
      injury prevention strategies can focus on methods to prevent damage occurring to grips
      through day-to-day use. If no such association is found, prevention strategies can be
      focused elsewhere, such as on design of effective protective clothing.

      Data collection for this feasibility study will occur between March 2015 and September 2015.

      The Chief Investigator, Mr. Andrew Neilson, funds the feasibility study.

NCT02399150,Biomarkers in Acute Abdomen,"
      Background: In the emergency setting, acute abdominal pain is a diagnostic challenge, as
      pain is a subjective measure, and serious causes needing surgical intervention do not always
      meet the clinical picture. Biomarkers measuring the individual stress or pain level may aid
      in identifying surgical emergencies, but there are many influencing factors that have to be
      taken into account.

      Objective: To evaluate defined stress biomarkers for their diagnostic and prognostic utility
      in measuring pain, and to evaluate potential influencing or confounding factors.

      Design: Prospective observational study in 200 patients presenting to the emergency
      department with acute abdominal pain.

      Estimated duration: May 2015 - May 2016 Location Setting: Emergency Department (ED) of the
      Hôpital Universitaire Pitié-Salpétrière, Paris, France.

      Study population: 200 patients presenting to the ED with acute abdomen

      Eligibility criteria:

        -  Inclusion criteria: Presentation at ED with acute abdominal pain, aged at least 18
           years

        -  Exclusion criteria: no informed consent, pregnancy, homeless, no social assurance

      Procedure:

      Patients presenting to the ED with acute abdominal pain will be included after informed
      consent is given. Blood and saliva samples will be drawn initially and after 4 hours, and
      baseline data assessed. All diagnostic procedures results and diagnosis made by the treating
      physicians as well as initiated treatment will be recorded Final diagnosis and outcome will
      be assessed by 2-week-telephone interview.

      Measurement of candidate biomarkers will be performed in collected material. Copeptin and
      SAA will be measured as potential biomarkers, as a control value, cortisol will be obtained.
      Other biomarkers will be in consideration, depending upon availability and financial
      aspects.

      Safety evaluations: All recommendations outlined in the ICH Guidelines for Good Clinical
      Practice will be adhered to throughout this trial.

      Sample size considerations: The number of patients of this pilote study is based on the
      estimate of 25 % or 50 of acute abdomen patients to have a surgical emergency.

      Significance of the study: If a biomarker is found that safely discriminates between
      surgical urgency and harmless abdominal pain, this will spare radiologic exposure in often
      young patients and will aid in optimized allocation of health care resources.

      Thoracic traumas are frequent causes of emergency department admissions and the third most
      common cause of death from trauma. Although emergency management of major thoracic traumas
      that have high mortality and morbidity were discussed and well-understood in detail in the
      literature, there are limited information regarding diagnosis, emergency management,
      treatment and follow-up after discharge of patients with minor blunt thoracic traumas.

      The investigators aimed to investigate demographic data, physical examination findings, and
      the relationship between lung injury, emergency department final diagnosis, hospitalization,
      discharge and re-admission rates, effects of prescribed analgesics on pain and re-admissions
      of patients with a pre-diagnosis of minor blunt thoracic trauma on first admission.

NCT02505347,Early Functional Return to Work Following Distal Biceps Repair,"
      Distal biceps ruptures occur most commonly among young males in their third and fourth
      decade of life. These injuries are becoming more common, however, as the aging population is
      remaining active through sport or labour demands. Distal biceps tears or ruptures follow a
      heavy eccentric load being placed on a shortened or flexed muscle, and often require
      surgical repair. Functionally, distal biceps injuries cause impairment as this portion of
      the muscle is largely responsible for supination and flexion at the elbow. Currently there
      is no consensus regarding post-operative immobilization protocols, and little evidence is
      available regarding timeframe for early return to functional activities. Existing evidence
      on functional outcomes post distal biceps tendon repair (DBTR) is of low quality with small
      sample sizes, and no known RCTs exist comparing early mobilization to immobilization on
      functional return. Reported timeframes for immobilization range from early controlled motion
      on day 1 post-operatively to complete immobilization for 6 weeks.

      The primary study goal is to determine the effect of immobilization compared to unrestricted
      mobility post DBTR on early functional return to activities. It has been previously reported
      that those with DBTR related to a workers compensation injury returned to full duties in
      3.95 months, while those with a non-workers compensation related injury returned to full
      work duties in 1.35 months. In Alberta, near 100 WCB claims were made for DBTR in both 2013
      and 2014. Early mobilization of these repairs may allow an earlier return to modified and
      full work duties, thereby improving the functional quality of life of the individual as well
      as reducing the overall cost of disability payments.

      This study will assess the 1) time to return to pre-injury work level and 2) time to return
      to modified duties among those who have no movement restriction post-repair and those who
      are splinted for 6 weeks. Re-rupture rates between groups will also be assessed as will
      strength, range of motion (ROM) and quality of life. These findings will assist in
      developing a standardized protocol for immobilization to optimize functional and clinical
      outcomes while expediting return to work.

NCT02527031,A Comparative Study Between a Pre-hospital and an In-hospital Circulatory Support Strategy (ECMO) in Refractory Cardiac Arrest (ACPAR2),"
      Cardiac arrest (CA) affects approximately 40,000 people in France. It is still a major cause
      of death in a young population. Management of CA is defined by international
      recommendations, detailed by learned societies in each country. It includes several links
      that are interconnected for its optimisation. Despite all these improvements, no progress,
      or little has been made in the survival of CA victims over the past few years in
      industrialised countries, and the survival rate in France is 3% to 5%.

      Refractory cardiac arrest is defined as failure, after 30 minutes of specialised
      resuscitation. It used to be the standard to admit that there was no hope of spontaneous
      cardiac activity and satisfactory neurological recovery after this period, except in cases
      of CA with neuroprotection (intoxication, hypothermia).

      External circulatory support such as ""extracorporeal membrane oxygenation"" (ECMO) makes it
      possible to replace the circulatory activity of the myocardium and the respiratory activity
      of the lungs.

      In in-hospital cardiac arrest (CA) some teams use ECMO with an improvement in the survival
      rate of 20% in comparison to standard resuscitation. This use demonstrates the possibility
      of neurological recovery independent of the recovery of spontaneous cardiac activity which
      can be differed.

      These results encouraged the use of ECMOs in cases of out-of-hospital refractory cardiac
      arrests. Patients who are victims of CA are resuscitated for 30 minutes on the spot where
      the CA occurs. They are then transferred to a specialised centre. The significant
      improvement in survival noted in in-hospital CAs was not observed in the French series of
      studies concerning out-of-hospital CAs. This survival is currently estimated at 4%. This
      difference can be partly explained by the difference in time between the beginning of
      cardiac massage and the implementation of circulatory support by ECMO (""low flow"" period).
      This time period is directly correlated to survival.

      To demonstrate the superiority of this strategy in terms of survival, investigators would
      like to conduct a randomised comparative study of two strategies: 1) installation of an ECMO
      between the 20th minute to the 30 minute of CA, directly at the site of the CA, by emergency
      physicians and/or specifically trained resuscitators 2) On-site resuscitation optimised with
      secondary transfer to the hospital for the implementation of support. The purpose is to
      increase by 5% to 20% the survival of victims of out-of-hospital refractory cardiac arrests
      with a good neurological prognosis.

      Main objective:

      The hypothesis is that pre-hospital ECMO will result in survival for 20% of the patients,
      considering that the percentage of survival with in-hospital ECMO is less than 5%.

      Main judgement criterion:

      Survival with good neurological outcome (CPC 1 or 2) on discharge from intensive care or at
      6 months

      Secondary judgement criteria:

      Success rate of the implementation of ECMO ECMO implementation time Immediate complications:
      haemorrhage, infection Number of organ harvesting The quality of survivors' neurological
      status according to the CPC neurological classification at D 28, 2 months and 1 year
      Predictive indicators of the prognosis during cardiac arrest via cerebral and biological
      monitoring Methodology, type of study: This is a prospective randomised study of current
      care Sample size (SS, power, risk): A total number of 105 patients in each group will make
      it possible to demonstrate at the alpha risk of 5% and a power of 1-β=90%, a significant
      difference in favour of early pre-hospital ECMO compared to the current practice with
      in-hospital ECMO.

NCT00132535,Influence of Chloroquine on HIV Viral Load Among Pregnant Women in Uganda,"
      There is conflicting evidence regarding the influence of HIV infection on the success of
      malaria prevention in pregnancy and effect on pregnancy outcome. The purpose of the proposed
      study is to assess the impact of HIV infection on the effectiveness of malaria prevention
      during pregnancy. This will be carried out by comparing two intermittent preventive
      treatments (IPTs) with sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (SP) plus 300 mg weekly chloroquine with
      two doses IPT plus a weekly chloroquine placebo. The emphasis will be on assessing the
      effect of chloroquine on HIV viral load and malaria morbidity and foetal outcome.

      The study will be a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial with two arms,
      involving pregnant women attending antenatal classes (ANCs) at health units, enrolled early
      in their second trimester at 3 health units of the Mbarara district and Kampala. All
      pregnant women presenting for antenatal care, irrespective of parity, who consent to
      participate will be enrolled. Women with severe systemic disease or symptoms of AIDS will be
      excluded from the study data analysis.

      Women will be screened for HIV status and their HIV viral loads will be measured at
      enrolment. Parasitaemia will be assessed at enrolment; at the beginning of the third
      trimester; and at delivery. Haemoglobin will be measured at the same time points.

      The main outcome variables to be assessed will be maternal peripheral parasitaemia;
      placental parasitaemia; maternal clinical malaria; congenital parasitaemia; and maternal and
      neonatal haemoglobin, birth weight and viral load at enrolment and before nevirapine
      administration to the HIV positive mothers at birth.

      Anthropological pre-studies to assess the quality of ANC services and healthcare seeking
      practices of pregnant women in the study area will be carried out. Focus group discussions
      (FGD) with pregnant women and mothers of neonates; in-depth interviews with relevant health
      workers; and illness narratives from pregnant women will be used to collect data. The
      anthropological study results will assist in appropriately planning for the trial to enhance
      compliance to the intervention.

      The data collection is planned to commence in August 2003 and is expected to end in October
      2005. Twelve months will be spent on the write-up phase.

NCT00132561,A Trial of Intermittent Treatment in the Prevention of Malaria in Senegalese Children,"
      In countries of the Sahel and sub-Sahel, malaria transmission is highly seasonal with nearly
      all infections occurring during a few months of the year. However, mortality and morbidity
      from malaria may be high during this period, especially in young children who are the group
      most at risk.

      Intermittent preventative treatment (IPT) is a new approach to the prevention of malaria in
      this situation. IPT involves the administration of an anti-malarial to children at risk for
      malaria at fixed times, even if they are not infected. To investigate how effective this
      approach might be in Senegal, a trial has been undertaken in which 1136 children aged 6
      weeks to 59 months were given a single dose of sulfadoxine pyrimethamine and artesunate on
      three occasions during a three-month rainy season and the incidence of clinical malaria in
      these children was compared with that in a group of children who received placebo.
      Additional observations were made on the incidence of side effects in children in the two
      groups and on the impact of IPT in children (IPTc) on markers of drug resistance in children
      whose blood films were positive for Plasmodium falciparum.

NCT00258024,Control of Pregnancy Associated Malaria With Intermittent Preventive Treatment,"
      Malaria is one of the major causes of illness and mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa. In Ghana,
      malaria is the most important cause of morbidity and accounts for about 40% of outpatient
      contacts. Chemoprophylaxis and insecticide-impregnated bed nets are used for malaria control
      in pregnancy.Chloroquine is administered within the ANC package at health facilities in
      Ghana. However, many pregnant women in rural,low-income communities do not report for ANC or
      report late thereby increasing their risk of morbidity and mortality. Reasons for this
      include inaccessibility and high cost. As the gap between urban and rural health care and
      socioeconomic circumstances increase, malaria control remains the major challenge of the
      health sector. A facility-based intervention alone is not sufficient to have a significant
      or sustained impact on malaria control in pregnancy. Alternative strategies are needed for
      the delivery of malaria interventions to pregnant women in rural areas in Ghana. The overall
      objective of this study is to develop alternative strategies for community involvement for
      delivery of malaria interventions to pregnant women in rural Ghana. The project will be
      conducted in the Afigya Sekyere district in the Ashanti Region of Ghana. Interviews and
      focus group discussions will be conducted with pregnant women and community members focusing
      on local knowledge on control of malaria in pregnancy and factors influencing utilization of
      antenatal services. Women in their first and second pregnancies who are permanently resident

      In Peru, Mefloquine plus Artesunate (MAS3), is the current first line treatment for P.
      falciparum malaria in the Amazonian Region, and has proved its efficacy against
      multi-resistant P. falciparum parasites, but several side effects have been reported.
      Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PPQ) is a new co-formulated and well tolerated ACT,
      increasingly used in Southeast Asia where it has proved to be highly effective against
      Plasmodium falciparum malaria. We tested the efficacy, safety and tolerability of DHA-PPQ in
      patients with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria. A RCT to evaluate DHA-PPQ was carried
      out, between 2003 and 2005. Patients with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria were randomly
      allocated to receive either DHA-PPQ or MAS3 with a 63-day follow-up period. Five hundred
      twenty two patients were included in the analysis, 262 were allocated to receive DHA-PPQ,
      and 260 to receive MAS3. The two groups were comparable at baseline in demographic and
      clinical characteristics. The mean time for parasite clearance into the DHA-PPQ group was
      32.0 hours and 35.5 hours in the MAS3 group. Twenty-four hours after the first dose, the
      proportions of patients whose cleared parasitaemia were 67.2% in the DHA-PPQ group, and
      58.1% in the MAS3 group (RR 1.25, [95% CI 1.03−1.52], p = 0.017). All patients were able to
      clear parasites within 72 hours after the first dose. The mean time for fever clearance was
      28.0 and 29.5 hours in DHA-PPQ and MAS3 group respectively. (P= 0.69). Twenty-four hours
      after the first dose, 85.5% and 83.1% of patients cleared fever in the DHA-PPQ and MAS3
      group respectively (p>0.05). The Adequate Clinical and Parasitological Response (ACPR), PCR
      adjusted, were 97.7% and 99,2% for the DHA-PPQ and MAS3 group respectively, (RR 0.99, 95% CI
      [0.86−1.13], P = 0.88). No Early Treatments Failures were reported in any group. In the
      DHA-PPQ group, according to the PCR adjusted results, 6 subjects had Late treatment
      Failures. In the MAS3 group, two Late Treatment Failures was reported. The frequency of
      adverse events was significantly lower in patients treated with DHA-PPQ than in those
      treated with MAS3.

      DHA-PPQ proved to be a highly effective antimalarial drug for the treatment of P. falciparum
      malaria and suitable for use in the Peruvian Amazon region. It also has the advantage of
      being better tolerated. In terms of cost, DHA-PPQ is cheaper and more affordable than MAS3

      IPT/SP was adopted in 2005 by The Ministry of Health (MoH) of Burkina Faso to replace
      chemoprophylaxis with CQ in pregnancy. The new strategy is being implemented but no delivery
      approach was defined and presumably IPT/SP will only be delivered to pregnant women
      presenting at ANC visits. It would be of extreme importance to ensure a better coverage and
      higher compliance to make the new strategy effective. In order to obtain a more efficient
      IPT/SP programme with a good level of compliance and coverage, several delivery approaches
      beside ANC should be explored.

      The study site will be in Pissy health district covering both peri-urban Ouagadougou city
      and rural areas. Participants include pregnant women irrespective of gravidity residing in
      the study area.

      The study is a prospective comparative study of 3 different approaches of delivering IPT/SP
      in the catchment areas of rural health facilities. The approaches will be the following:

        1. Passive health centre based delivery approach (PHC). IPT/SP will be delivered to
           pregnant women presenting to the health centre for ANC visits.

        2. Joint, with an advanced strategies delivery approach (JAS). In addition to passive
           delivery at health centres, the pregnant women will be reached during preventive
           activities the health staff carry out regularly in villages, such as immunization,
           health promotion, and even ANC visits.

        3. Community based distribution delivery approach (CBD). In addition to passive delivery

NCT00589329,Antibiotics and the Prolongation of Pregnancy in Preterm Labor With an Advanced Cervical Exam,"
      Preterm birth, its causes, prevention, complications and ramifications persist as an
      important focus of obstetrical research. In the United States 11.8% of all live births occur
      prior to 37 weeks gestation. As many as 45% of these deliveries will have been proceeded by
      preterm labor with intact membranes.(2) Both preterm labor and preterm premature rupture of
      membranes have both been associated with evidence intrauterine infection. While antibiotic
      treatment in conservative management of preterm PROM remote from term has been shown to
      significantly prolong pregnancy and reduce infant morbidity, (16) data regarding the
      effectiveness of antibiotics for pregnancy prolongation in preterm labor are inconsistent.
      (3-15) Currently, narrow spectrum antibiotics (penicillin or clindamycin) are given prior to
      delivery to reduce the risk of neonatal Group B Beta Streptococcus (GBS) sepsis, however
      broad spectrum antibiotic treatment of women with preterm labor for pregnancy prolongation
      is not recommended.

      Review of the literature regarding antibiotic treatment for pregnancy prolongation in
      preterm labor reveals that most studies utilized single agent therapy, and no study has
      evaluated the use of antibiotics for pregnancy prolongation in women with an advanced
      cervical exam (>4cm). While a number of studies have shown significant pregnancy
      prolongation in unselected populations,(5,12,13) only one study of 12 reviewed was able to
      show a neonatal benefit to adjunctive antibiotic use.(12,20) Norman, et al was able to show
      a reduction in the incidence of necrotising enterocolitis with the use of antibiotics. Given
      the number of studies in this area, and the lack of supporting evidence, this likely
      represents an alpha error. Another study by Svare et al was able to show a significant
      decrease in NICU admissions for women treated with antibiotics in the setting of preterm
      labor, however no change was reported in neonatal morbidities.

      Our proposed study is designed to evaluate patients at particular risk for preterm delivery;
      those with advanced cervical exam. In this randomized prospective controlled study, we
      intend to examine the influence of adjunctive antibiotic use in preterm labor complicated by
      a cervical exam of 4 cm or greater. We plan to compare a study group receiving
      broad-spectrum antibiotics with a control group that will not receive antibiotics for
      pregnancy prolongation. Both groups will receive antibiotics for GBS prophylaxis as
      indicated. We hope to see a delay in delivery in the study group as a primary outcome.
      Secondary outcomes will include the use of steroids, neonatal complications including
      sepsis, intraventricular hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacea, mechanical ventilation
      and respiratory distress syndrome, retinopathy of prematurity and necrotizing enterocolitis,

NCT00730366,New Approaches to Improve Coverage and Compliance of Antimalarial Treatment for Pregnant Women in Rural Africa,"
      Malaria in pregnancy contributes substantially to maternal anaemia and low birth weight:
      effective malaria control in pregnancy could avoid about 10,000 maternal and up to 200,000
      infant deaths every year. Intermittent preventive treatment with the drug
      sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (IPTp-SP), administered at least twice during routine antenatal
      clinics, is recommended by the World Health Organization for areas of moderate to high
      malaria transmission, including Sub-Saharan Africa.

      Studies carried out in Kenya and Malawi before 2004 had showed that two doses of IPTp-SP
      significantly reduce maternal anaemia, placental malaria parasitaemia and low birth weight.
      However, in countries where this strategy had been introduced as part of national policy,
      the coverage of the target population has varied widely, with estimates of 33-93% for uptake
      of one dose and 24-68% for two doses, and no country had reached the goal of 80% of pregnant
      women receiving at least 2 doses of IPTp. New approaches designed to improve IPTp coverage
      were therefore urgently needed.

      This study was therefore set up in 2002, in order to evaluate the additional effect of a
      targeted promotional campaign on antenatal clinics utilization and on coverage and uptake of
      Intermittent preventive treatment with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine in a rural health district

      with the sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine compared with weekly chloroquine, in order to provide

      Malaria is one of the major infectious diseases in the world with a tremendous impact on the
      quality of life significantly contributing to the ongoing poverty in endemic countries. It
      causes almost one million deaths per year, the majority of which are children under the age
      of five. The malaria parasite enters the human body through the skin, by the bite of an
      infected mosquito. Subsequently, it invades the liver and develops and multiplies inside the
      hepatocytes. After a week, the hepatocytes burst open and the parasites are released in the
      blood stream, causing the clinical phase of the disease.

      As a unique opportunity to study malaria immunology and efficacy of immunisation strategies,
      a protocol has been developed in the past to conduct experimental human malaria infections
      (EHMIs). EHMIs generally involve small groups of malaria-naïve volunteers infected via the
      bites of P. falciparum infected laboratory-reared Anopheline mosquitoes. Although
      potentially serious or even lethal, P. falciparum malaria can be radically cured at the
      earliest stages of blood infection where risks of complications are virtually absent.

      The investigators have shown previously that healthy human volunteers can be protected from
      a malaria mosquito (sporozoite) challenge by immunization with sporozoites (by mosquito
      bites) under chloroquine prophylaxis (CPS immunization). However, it is unknown how many
      mosquito bites are necessary to confer protection. Moreover, as all volunteers were
      protected in this study, no correlates of protection could be established. For future
      development of vaccines and understanding of protective immunity to malaria, it is important
      to investigate the lowest dose of CPS immunization that confers 100% protection and to find
      correlates of protection. Therefore, the present study aims to make the CPS immunization
      protocol more sensitive by lowering the number of infected mosquito bites, in order to study
      the underlying mechanisms of protection.

      bites needed in a model using irradiated mosquitoes. One possible explanation for this
      efficient induction of protective immunity, is the immune modulating effect of chloroquine.
      The investigators aim to assess this possible immune modulating effect in CPS immunization

      Given the resistance emergence of malaria in pregnant women receiving intermittent
      preventive treatment with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (IPT-SP) and the burden of this
      infection among pregnant women infected by HIV it is urgent to seek a more effective
      alternative treatment to optimize the prevention of malaria. Cotrimoxazole (CTM), actually
      administered daily as a prophylactic mean to opportunistic infections for HIV infected
      patients, showed encouraging results in preventing malaria in pregnant women. However, these
      results must be confirmed by randomized trials, particularly in pregnant women.

      The main objective of this clinical trial is to compare the efficacy of cotrimoxazole (CTM),
      administered once daily with IPT-SP (3 curative doses spaced one month) on placental
      parasitaemia in pregnant women infected with HIV and cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) >
      350 cells/mm3.

      The main hypothesis is based on the premise that cotrimoxazole is more effective than IPT-SP
      for placental parasitaemia. This might be due to the higher plasma concentration of
      cotrimoxazole attained with daily doses. If this hypothesis is proven, cotrimoxazole could
      be recommended as prophylaxis for HIV-positive pregnant women, whatever their CD4+ cell
      count. In this study, the investigators will also test the hypothesis that the strains of

      Ultimately, the key to malaria control, and hopefully eradication, would be an effective
      vaccine. Though a number of vaccine-candidates have entered the pipeline of pre-clinical and
      clinical development, they have yet to achieve the level of efficacy necessary for effective
      malaria prevention. It has been shown previously that if healthy human volunteers taking
      chloroquine chemoprophylaxis are repeatedly exposed to Plasmodium parasites through the
      bites of infected mosquitoes, they are fully protected against a later challenge infection
      with a 'homologous' (genetically similar) Plasmodium parasite. This process is known as
      ChemoProphylaxis and Sporozoites, or CPS-immunization. One of the obstacles to developing an
      effective vaccine is the genetic heterogeneity of malaria parasites. To further consider the
      development of whole-parasite based vaccines against malaria and in order to better
      understand the protective immunity induced by CPS-immunization, it is essential to

      - To find out if combining live, infectious malaria parasites (known as Sanaria PfSPZ
      Challenge) and two FDA approved drugs that kill malaria parasites (pyrimethamine [PYR] and
      chloroquine [CQ]) is safe and can provide people protection against malaria. The Sanaria
      PfSPZ Challenge has been used in other studies without significant side effects.

      Eligibility:

        -  Healthy people ages 18 50 who weigh less than 170 pounds and are not pregnant or
           breastfeeding

        -  No history of hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or HIV infection

        -  Not currently enrolled in a clinical trial that involves a research drug or vaccine

        -  Have not traveled to an area with high malaria transmission within the last 5 years

        -  Never diagnosed with malaria in the past

      Design:

        -  Participants will be in 1 of 4 groups.

        -  Participants will receive a combination of injections and drugs. What combination they
           will receive will depend on what group they are in. This combination of injections and
           drugs may include:

             -  Injections of Sanaria PfSPZ Challenge (live, infectious malaria parasites) into a

             -  FDA approved antimalarial drug called pyrimethamine (PYR)

             -  FDA approved antimalarial drug called Malarone

             -  The study will last approximately 3 7 months (depending on which group

      immunity to malaria, malaria infection in pregnancy leads to placental malaria (PM), often
      without clinical symptoms in the mother. The systemic and placental changes that occur with
      malaria in pregnancy can adversely affect the developing fetal brain, an fetal brain injury
      strongly affects long-term childhood neurodevelopmental (ND) and behavior but there are no
      published studies to date on the impact of malaria in pregnancy on childhood ND. This study,
      conducted in Uganda, will address the effects of malaria in pregnancy and childhood ND and
      define mechanisms by which malaria may lead to ND impairment including micronutrient
      deficiencies. ND outcomes will be measured by the following neuropsychological and
      behavioral tests: Mullen Scales of Early Learning, the Color Object Association Test, the
      Early Childhood Vigilance Test, the Behavior Rating Scales, the Behavior Related inventory
      of Executive Function and the Child Behavior Checklist. These tests will be given at 12, 24
      and 36 months of age. This study will be nested in an ongoing Ugandan IRB approved
      interventional trial (PROMOTE-II) (NCT02163447). Blood sampling is being conducted in the
      PROMOTE-II protocol for research purposes. Some of that blood will be used to test for
      micronutrient deficiencies as well as other immune responses to malaria.

      Early detection of colo-rectal adenoma using colonoscopy can prevent occurrence of colon
      cancers. While colonoscopy is a standard technique, it can miss early cancers. To improve
      the detection rate, Narrow Band Imaging (NBI) was introduced in 2006. It has been shown to
      compare favorably with chromo-endoscopy in the sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis
      of malignant colo-rectal neoplasms. The major drawback of NBI is that images become dark in
      the presence of blood and fecal matters. The bright-NBI is a prototype imaging technology
      that enables endoscopists to obtain better images in suboptimal conditions. The study

      Summary Colorectal cancer (CRC) represents the second leading cause of cancer deaths in
      Spain (11,000 deaths per year). Screening of the population over 50 years of age with no
      significant history (intermediate risk) is recommended, but which screening method is best
      for promoting adherence in this type of patient has not been well established. There are
      currently two screening methods that are less invasive than conventional colonoscopy and
      seem to have higher sensitivity than the test for faecal occult blood (FOBT). These two
      methods are the colon capsule, which consists in ingesting a capsule that takes photographs
      of the colon, and virtual colonoscopy, which is a radiological technique.

      Objectives: 1. To demonstrate that virtual colonoscopy and colon capsule are effective CRC
      screening techniques in the intermediate risk population, with diagnostic rates comparable
      to conventional colonoscopy (concordance). 2. To compare the diagnostic rates of the colon
      capsule and virtual colonoscopy with respect to the size and characteristics of the lesions

      There is a need for better visualization of polyps during surveillance endoscopy in patients

      Syndrome (LS), to improve the adenoma detection rate. Optical molecular imaging of adenoma
      associated biomarkers is a promising technique to accommodate this need. The biomarker
      Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) is overexpressed in adenomatous colon tissue
      versus normal tissue and has proven to be a valid target for molecular imaging. The

      The risk of CRC in families of patients with CRC is well established, but it is less
      well-defined for families of patients with adenomas. Screening recommendations to families
      when an index subject has an adenoma on colonoscopy are not clear. Previous studies
      demonstrating an increased CRC risk in close relatives of subjects with adenomas were mostly
      limited by the lack of a suitable comparison group, did not offer colonoscopy to all
      relatives or did not have verification on true status of adenoma history in the relatives. A
      systematic review has reported that most studies cited for risk of CRC in relatives with
      adenomas have not addressed the intended question. Currently International guidelines
      recommended screening colonoscopy in close relatives and at a younger age when there is a
      proband with an adenoma, however this recommendation has not been fully supported by all
      societies due to the lack of robust evidence. This gap in knowledge highlights the need of
      well-designed and adequately powered studies to estimate the risk of colorectal neoplasms in
      subjects who have first-degree relatives with adenomas.

      Up to 30% of average risk asymptomatic individuals 50 years or older will have at least one
      adenoma. Based on current guidelines, nearly half the population will be counseled to
      undergo a colonoscopy from 40 years old based on a positive family history of adenoma. This
      will have enormous burden on the healthcare system if screening is implicated in all these
      individuals. Secondly, not all adenomas carry the same risk. Large or villous adenomas are
      associated with a nearly 70% increased risk of CRC in first degree relatives (FDR) whereas
      small adenomas may be associated with a modest increased risk 19. It is therefore important
      to determine the risk of colorectal neoplasms in families of subjects with non-advanced
      adenomas to justify more intensive screening in these individuals. Investigators hypothesize
      that first-degree relatives of patients with non-advanced adenoma have an increased risk of
      both CRC and adenomas. Investigators aim to quantify this risk, and to identify other
      individual patient or neoplasm characteristics that may contribute to this increased risk.
      In addition, Investigators aim to determine molecular alteration profiles of colonic adenoma
      in siblings of patients with advanced neoplasm.

NCT02538406,The Utility of Time Segmental Withdrawal During Screening Colonoscopy for Increasing Adenoma Detection Rate.,"
      Colonoscopy( examining the colon with a flexible tube and a camera ) is usually done for
      screening purposes to find any precancerous lesions (polyps) at an early stage. During the
      colonoscopy the doctor will advance the colonoscope to the end of your colon and start
      examining the colon for any polyps. ""Withdrawal time"" is the period of time the doctor
      spends examining the colon. Doctors usually spend six minutes examining the colon after they
      reach the end of the colon. Studies have showed that spending more withdrawal time detects
      more lesions. The proposal to dedicating half of the withdrawal time during colonoscopy in
      examining the right side will increase the detection of polyps in the right side of the
      colon. There will be no other changes in the procedural aspect of the colonoscopy.

NCT00000402,Calcium and Bone Mass in Young Females,"
      We originally suggested that calcium in the diet is important in determining the amount of
      bone (bone mass) that builds up in young adults. We are testing the effect of calcium on
      bone mass in 354 Caucasian (white) girls. At the start of this 7-year study, the average age
      of the girls was 11 years, and they had not yet reached puberty. The study will also provide
      information about the effect of calcium on body composition (body fat) and blood pressure in
      young women.

      We have been giving calcium to one group of participants in this study and giving a placebo
      (an inactive pill, or ""sugar pill"") to the other group. The results of this research will be
      important in preventing osteoporosis, because building more bone as a young person should
      reduce a woman's chances of developing osteoporosis later in life.

NCT00000430,Low-Dose Hormone Replacement Therapy and Alendronate for Osteoporosis,"
      Osteoporosis, a condition in which bones are fragile and break easily, is a major health
      problem for postmenopausal women. Research studies have shown that both estrogen/progestin
      replacement therapy (hormone replacement therapy, or HRT) and alendronate are effective in
      preventing and treating osteoporosis. However, because these drugs work in somewhat
      different ways, a combination of the two drugs might protect women from osteoporosis better
      than either drug alone. In this study we will test whether HRT and alendronate given
      together for 3.5 years to postmenopausal women with low bone mass will have a greater effect
      on bone than either HRT or alendronate given alone. We will also give every participant in
      this study calcium and vitamin D supplements.

NCT00001720,Treatment of Childhood Osteoporosis With Alendronate (Fosamax),"
      Bones grow and stay strong through a continuous process of formation (building) and
      resorption (break down). When more bone is formed than resorbed, the density (level of
      calcium) in bone increases and the bones become stronger. However, if more bone is resorbed
      than formed the density of bone decreases and the bones become weak. This condition is
      called osteoporosis.

      Osteoporosis is a rare but serious condition in children. Childhood osteoporosis can occur
      without a known cause (idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis). Children with osteoporosis suffer
      from pain, inability to stay active, and increased amounts of broken bones, including
      fractures of the spine. Even mild childhood osteoporosis may have long-term consequences
      since individuals who achieve a less than normal bone composition (peak bone mass) during
      the first 20-30 years of life may be at an increased risk for osteoporosis as adults.

      Alendronate (Fosamax) is a drug that works by stopping bone resorption (break down). It has
      been used to treat post-menopausal osteoporosis, male osteoporosis and adults with
      osteoporosis due to long-term steroid therapy. The goal of this study is to determine the
      effectiveness of alendronate in children with idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis. Researchers
      believe that children treated with alendronate will improve bone strength and decrease the
      amount of fractures caused by osteoporosis.

NCT00001951,Hormone Replacement in Young Women With Premature Ovarian Failure,"
      The human ovary produces male sex hormones (androgen) and female sex hormones (estrogen).
      Currently, androgen is not included in hormone replacement therapy for women with premature
      ovarian failure. Present hormone replacement therapy (HRT) was designed to treat women who
      experience ovarian failure at menopause (around the age of 50). However, 1% of women will
      experience premature failure of the ovaries before the age of 40. There have been no studies
      conducted to determine proper hormone replacement therapies for these younger women. Some
      research suggests that the usual menopausal hormone replacement therapy is not adequate to
      protect young women with premature ovarian failure from developing osteoporosis. Women with
      premature ovarian failure have abnormally low levels of androgens circulating in their
      blood. This may contribute to the increase risk for osteoporosis.

      This study will compare two treatment plans for women with premature ovarian failure.
      Treatment plan one will be physiological estrogen hormone replacement. Treatment plan two
      will be physiological estrogen hormone replacement plus androgen. The study will attempt to
      determine which plan is more beneficial to women in relation to osteoporosis and heart
      disease.

      The hormones will be contained in patches and given by placing the patches against the
      patient's skin. The patches were designed to deliver the same amount of hormone as would be
      normally produced by the ovary in young women.

      The success of the treatment will be measured by periodically checking the density of
      patient's bone in the leg (femoral neck bone) . Researchers will take an initial (baseline)
      measurement of bone density before beginning treatment and then once a year, for 3
      additional years, during treatment. The study will also consider bone density of the spine,
      bone turnover, heart disease risk factors, and psychological state.

NCT00021827,PTHrP and Osteoporosis,"
      PTH-related protein, or ''PTHrP'', is a hormone which was discovered in 1987. As its name
      implies, it is closely related to another hormone discovered in the 1920's named parathyroid
      hormone or ''PTH''. PTH has been shown to be effective in treating osteoporosis in both
      animals and humans. PTHrP has been shown to be effective in treating osteoporosis in
      laboratory animals, and there are strong scientific reasons to think that it may be
      effective in humans as well. However, no human trials with PTHrP in the treatment of

      diagnosed by a physician, use of hypoglycemic medications, or fasting glucose > 126 mg/dl
      (7.0mM) in accordance with the American Diabetes Association criteria. The diabetic patient
      population will be divided into 2 groups: patients with status post low energy fractures of
      the proximal humerus, the proximal femur, the ankle and the foot (n=10) versus diabetic
      patients with no fractures or low energy trauma fracture history (n=10). An additional group
      of 10 diabetic postmenopausal women will be recruited and will have magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) of the lower back only. Caucasian, Asian and Hispanic women will be combined
      since a previous study suggested that BMD is very similar in these 3 population and that
      ethnic differences are minimal. In addition a population of 10 age-matched, BMI-matched,
      race-matched healthy women, without osteoporotic fractures will be examined. In all of these
      volunteers a medical history will be obtained to ensure good health status and rule out
      chronic diseases that would have an impact on bone metabolism. Patients will undergo MRI,
      QCT and high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) examinations
      to determine bone mineral density and bone structure/quality.

      The hypothesis of this pilot project is that type II diabetic patients with and without
      low-energy fractures have a different trabecular bone architecture and composition, which is
      also different when compared to normal age-matched healthy patients. Architectural
      differences in these three patient groups may be visualized with high resolution MRI and
      high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) and will be most
      pronounced at the calcaneus and the distal tibia. Analyzing structure parameters obtained
      from high resolution MRI and spectroscopy may improve our understanding of the

NCT00982371,An Investigation Into Bone Micro-architecture in Women With Type 2 Diabetes,"
      The number of people with type 2 diabetes is growing. This puts a lot of pressure on the
      health care systems. Type 2 diabetes is often associated with health problems, like poor
      eyesight, muscle coordination, muscle strength, and blood flow. Poor bone health may also be
      a concern for people with type 2 diabetes.

      A large proportion of people with type 2 diabetes will break a bone in their lifetime. The
      risk of this happening in older people with type 2 diabetes is greater than the risk in
      older people without diabetes. Fracturing a bone can be very painful, and lead to serious
      consequences, especially if the individual experiences a hip fracture. The elevated fracture
      risk, seen in those with type 2 diabetes, is puzzling because people with type 2 diabetes
      often appear to have normal, healthy bones compared to people of the same age without
      diabetes.

      Bone micro-structure, which is not assessed by traditional bone densitometry systems (ie:
      DXA) contributes to overall bone strength.

      The hypothesis of this study is that bone micro-structure is of poorer quality (reduced
      trabecular thickness, increased trabecular spacing) in postmenopausal women with type 2
      diabetes, compared to age-matched control participants.

      Specific Aim 1: To compare effects of Vitamin D supplementation to usual care on symptoms in
      women transitioning to early postmenopause and determine the associated effect size in order
      to conduct a power analysis for a future RCT. Hypothesis: Vitamin D insufficient women in
      early postmenopause who are randomized to supplementation, titrated to achieve sufficiency
      for 2 months, will have fewer symptoms including hot flashes, mood, and musculoskeletal
      complaints than women randomized to usual care.

      Specific Aim 2: To compare effects of Vitamin D supplementation to usual care on body
      composition (by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry [DXA] and by weight, BMI, waist to hip
      ratio) in overweight/obese women transitioning to early postmenopause and determine the
      associated effect size for a power analysis for a future RCT. Hypothesis: Vitamin D
      insufficient women in the menopausal transition randomized to supplementation, titrated to
      achieve sufficiency for 9 months, will improve DXA body composition (less total body and
      abdominal fat), compared to women in usual care, who will have increased body weight,
      including total and abdominal fat.

      Specific Aim 3: To estimate the proportion of overweight/obese middle-aged women who achieve
      sufficiency by 1 month versus 2 or more months and to determine if achieving sufficiency by
      1 month varies by baseline characteristics. Hypothesis: About 80% of participants will
      achieve sufficient Vitamin D level by 1 month. Those who need more than 1 month for
      sufficiency will have lower baseline levels and higher initial BMI.

NCT01152580,Melatonin Osteoporosis Prevention Study,"
      Osteoporosis is one of the most common skeletal disorders. Today in the United States, 10
      million individuals have osteoporosis and 34 million more have low bone mass or osteopenia,
      which places them at an increased risk of some day developing osteoporosis. Of the people
      affected by this problem, 68% are women.The current thinking on the development of
      osteoporosis is that the changes in bone turnover that occur with aging play a major factor.
      Many modalities of treatment are used to prevent the bone loss and increased fracture risk
      associated with osteoporosis and osteopenia. Melatonin supplementation may be another
      treatment modality that lowers risk of hip fracture in perimenopausal women. Melatonin can
      remodel bone in animal models and in culture. Melatonin works through melatonin receptors to
      form osteoblasts from human mesenchymal stem cells and has been shown to inhibit osteoclast
      activity in rodents. Melatonin levels have been correlated with modulating bone markers; low
      nocturnal levels of melatonin correlate with in an increase in bone marker metabolism and
      osteoporosis. It is been shown that women who have worked night-shifts for greater than 20
      years have increased risk for wrist and hip fractures. Night-shift workers have lower
      nocturnal melatonin levels than people who do not work the night-shift. The addition of
      exogenous melatonin suppresses bone marker metabolism. In human stem cells taken from bone
      marrow, melatonin increases the activity of bone-forming cells called osteoblasts. It is
      hypothesized that melatonin will improve bone health, menopausal quality of life and sleep
      compared to placebo in perimenopausal women. In particular, the investigators expect
      perimenopausal women taking melatonin to show an improvement in overall bone health as
      revealed by a reduction in bone marker turnover since bone resorption increases more so than
      bone absorption in this population compared to those women taking placebo. We also expect
      that perimenopausal women taking melatonin to have better control over their menopausal
      symptoms, better quality of life and less sleep disturbances when compared to their placebo
      controls since melatonin is known to modulate estrogen levels in the body and regulate
      sleep. The data from these studies may provide novel and alternative uses for melatonin; in
      particular its use for the prevention and/or treatment of osteoporosis.

NCT01206491,Development of Intervention Model for Osteoporosis and Fall Prevention in Taiwan,"
      Department of Chronic Disease and Health Promotion of World Health Organization listed eight
      classes of chronic disease which will be important globally in the future. And the sixth
      class is ""Chronic Rheumatic Condition"", which includes rheumatic arthritis, osteoarthritis,
      osteoporosis, spinal disorders and severe limb trauma. Obviously the osteoporosis is a
      globally important health topic.

      Osteoporosis draws more and more attention, because osteoporosis has various influences, for
      example, (1) psychologically impact which occurs frequently in many chronic diseases, such
      as depression will appear evidently in patients with osteoporosis (2) patients with
      osteoporosis often lose their social role (3) osteoporosis might induce pain and limitation
      of body function (4) osteoporosis increases greatly the possibility of fracture.
      Osteoporosis will induce adverse outcomes, such as the fall of life quality, the increase of
      morbidity and mortality, as well as the increased abuse of medical service. In this project,
      the investigators will set up the intervention model for prevention of osteoporosis as well
      as falls.

      In this project, the investigators will recruit patients form outpatient services at WanFang
      Hospital. Through the collection of baseline data from questionnaire and bone density
      measurement, the investigators can clarify the risk of osteoporosis and falls in studied
      patients. By using double-blind randomized design, the patients will be collected to either
      one of intervention and control group. After eight weeks of intervention programs, the
      investigators will follow on both groups to understand the effect of this program and to
      increase the bone density of intervention group. The hospital or the Health center might
      take the outcome to be the reference of taking care the Osteoporosis.

NCT01232647,Vitamin K as Additive Treatment in Osteoporosis,"
      Vitamin K is thought to be important for bone health because it activates several proteins
      involved in bone formation. Poor dietary intake of vitamin K (mainly found in dark green
      leafy vegetables) is associated with bone loss and fractures. Giving supplements of the main
      dietary form of vitamin K (called K1) or another common form which our bodies make from
      K1(called MK4), to improve bone health have given mixed results. This confusion is thought
      to have arisen because these studies involved people who already had enough vitamin K or did
      not have osteoporosis. We want to test the hypothesis that treatment with bisphosphonates
      combined with vitamin K, in vitamin K deplete elderly women with osteoporosis, may offer
      additional benefit on skeletal metabolism and reduction of fracture risk. We want to test
      this by measuring vitamin K status in post-menopausal women with osteoporosis who are on the
      recommended treatment with a bisphosphonate and calcium/vitamin D supplements. Those with
      low vitamin K will then be recruited to study the effect of supplementation with either K1
      or MK4.

NCT01440803,Forteo Trial on Idiopathic Osteoporosis in Premenopausal Women,"
      Idiopathic osteoporosis (IOP) is defined as osteoporosis that affects young, otherwise
      completely healthy individuals with no secondary cause of bone loss. In the course of our
      prior research with premenopausal women with IOP, the investigators have shown that women
      with IOP have low areal bone mineral density (aBMD) at the spine, hip and forearm compared
      to normal women. Additionally, using noninvasive high resolution imaging of the central and
      peripheral skeleton and detailed analyses of transiliac crest bone biopsies, the
      investigators identified several features of bone quality in premenopausal women with IOP.

      There is currently no FDAapproved therapy for IOP in premenopausal women. However,
      teriparatide (Forteo) has been shown to improve bone mass and microarchitecture in
      postmenopausal women and is approved for men with primary or idiopathic osteoporosis, as
      well as men, premenopausal and postmenopausal women with glucocorticoid-induced
      osteoporosis. Because IOP in premenopausal women is an orphan disease, with an estimated
      prevalence of about 113,000 in the United States, pharmaceutical companies are unlikely to
      support development of therapies for this indication. Therefore the major objective of this
      protocol is to establish the safety and efficacy of teriparatide in premenopausal women with
      IOP in a phase 2 clinical trial. All subjects will receive teriparatide as part of the
      study, but a randomly selected group of patients (10) will receive one year of placebo
      injections first before starting their two years of treatment. The remainder of subjects
      (30) will receive active drug only for two years.

NCT01698463,Prescribe Exercise for Prevention of Falls and Fractures: A Family Health Team Approach,"
      Falls and fractures are a leading cause of death and disability in the older adult
      population. The consequences of falls and fractures contribute substantially to health care
      costs and can have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of the individual.
      Exercise has been studied as an option to reduce fracture risk and prevent falls though
      improving balance and muscle strength. The prevention of falls is important, as a history of
      falls is strongly predictive of suffering another. Those who are at a high risk of fracture
      or falling require a patient specific assessment and individualized exercise prescription
      that is tailored to their needs. This kind of program may not be typically available within
      the community and at a low cost. These individuals may experience difficulty when trying to
      engage in exercise due to barriers such as a lack of transportation, and a lack of
      knowledge. As the first point of contact with the health care system for many family doctors
      are in the ideal position to deliver exercise advice to their patients. However, a lack of
      time and specialized skills in prescribing exercise make this difficult for many of them. As
      a result, family health teams who provide interdisciplinary patient centered care are
      becoming popular. In this model the care is shared and provided by the most appropriate team
      member (e.g. doctor, nurse, exercise specialist). Additionally, many exercise interventions
      do not include a behavior change aspect, which may be an important component when trying to
      get individuals to engage in a new health behavior like exercise. Therefore the purpose of
      this project is to assess the feasibility of implementing a tailored exercise program to
      those at high risk of falls or fractures over the age of 65 in a primary care setting using
      an interdisciplinary model of care that is based on a health behaviour change model.

NCT01846533,Osteoprosis in Type 2 Diabetic Patients- a Cohort Study,"
      Some possible humoural and cellular mechanism for diabetes related osteoporosis/fractures
      were proposed and summarzied as the following, (1)Diabetes mellitus increases osteoclast
      function but decreases osteoblast function, thereby leading to accelerated bone loss,
      osteopenia and osteoporosis. (2)DM/hyperglycemia induces production of macrophage colony
      stimulating factor (MCSF), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and receptor activator of nuclear
      factor-κB ligand (RANKL), all of which are osteoblast-derived activators of osteoclast
      proliferation and differentiation. (3) DM/hyperglycemia suppresses osteoblast proliferation
      and function, in part, by decreasing runtrelated transcription factor (Runx)-2, osteocalcin
      and osteopontin expressions. (4)Adipogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells is
      increased as indicated by the overexpression of adipocyte differentiation markers, including
      peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-g, adipocyte fatty acid binding protein
      (aP2), adipsin and resistin. A decrease in neovascularization may further aggravate bone
      loss. (5)Bone quality is also reduced as a result of advanced glycation end products (AGE)
      production, which may eventually result in low impact or fragility fractures. DM are
      associated osteoporosis/fracture. The underlying mechanism, especially of type 2 DM,
      mandates a DM-osteoporosis cohort to elucidate. In clinical practice, to developed

      Osteoporosis is a disease that leads to impaired skeletal strength and increased fracture
      risk. Among 200 million osteoporotic patients (Tarantino, Cannata et al. 2007) most are
      diagnosed only after a fracture. We expect with our aging population to see a significant
      increase in the prevalence of osteoporosis. It is estimated that over 75% of osteoporotic
      patients are not diagnosed and do not receive treatment for their condition.

      This research plan describes a study for clinical validation of the novel ultrasound device
      (Bindex®, Bone Index Finland Ltd.). In a preliminary study, the technique has been validated
      in a Finnish postmenopausal woman population of 285 healthy and 56 osteoporotic subjects (n

      determined with Bindex and femoral neck bone mineral density determined with DXA (r = 0.65 -
      0.70). In addition, with determination of 90% sensitivity and specificity thresholds,
      significant number (65-75%) of patients could be diagnosed without additional verification
      with DXA.

      For validation of the technique in US population, our study plan is presented for

      60 to 69 years, age 70 to 79 years, and age 80 to 89 years. The feasibility of DI for
      diagnostics of osteoporosis and evaluation of bone mineral density (BMD) will be assessed.
      The thresholds for the BMD estimate obtained with DI will be determined for osteoporotic and
      non-osteoporotic patients. For fracture risk assessment, DI measurements are used to predict
      the outcome of currently available fracture risk assessment tools.

NCT00001776,Effects of Brain Stimulation on Learning and Reasoning,"
      Imaging studies of the brain have revealed the different areas involved in the processes of
      learning and reasoning. However, the specific role these regions play in these processes, or
      if stimulating these areas can improve these processes is unknown.

      Researchers would like to use repetitive transcranial stimulation (rTMS) to better
      understand the roles of individual brain regions on the processes of learning and reasoning.
      Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) involves the placement of a cooled
      electromagnet with a figure-eight coil on the patient's scalp, and rapidly turning on and
      off the magnetic flux. This permits non-invasive, relatively localized stimulation of the
      surface of the brain (cerebral cortex). The effect of magnetic stimulation varies, depending
      upon the location, intensity and frequency of the magnetic pulses.

      The purpose of this study is to use rTMS to help determine the roles of different brain
      regions in the development of implicit learning of motor sequences and analogic reasoning.
      In addition, researchers hope to evaluate if stimulation of these regions speeds up the
      process of learning or analogic reasoning.

NCT00001777,Sertraline for the Treatment of Patients With Frontal Lobe Dementia (FLD),"
      Dementia refers to a condition where there is a loss of intellectual function (cognition).
      It is usually a progressive condition that interferes with normal social and occupational
      activities.

      Patients with frontal lobe dementia (FLD) suffer from a destruction of the brain cells found
      in the frontal lobe of the brain. Loss of frontal lobe neurons can cause changes in
      personality, such as aggressiveness, agitation, and depression. In addition, patients with
      FLD may have difficulty planning tasks and may have a loss of motivation.

      Researchers believe that the cells lost in the frontal lobe of the brain are responsible for
      producing a chemical called serotonin. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter, which means it is
      used by neurons to communicate with other neurons. Researchers are inclined to believe that
      by replacing the missing serotonin, symptoms of FLD may be relieved.

      Drugs known as serotonin uptake inhibitors, help to maintain high levels of serotonin in the
      body. They have been used successfully to treat patients with depression and patients with
      violent / impulsive behaviors. Sertraline is a serotonin reuptake blocker that is relatively
      easy to give (once daily), is safer than most other serotonin reuptake blockers (very little
      effect on vital enzyme systems [cytochrome P-450]), and has few interactions with other
      drugs.

      This study is designed to test the effectiveness of Sertraline for the treatment of symptoms
      associated with FLD. Patients participating in the study will receive Sertraline for 6 weeks
      and a placebo ""inactive sugar pill"" for 6 weeks. During the study, researchers will test
      psychological and neurological functions to measure the effects of the drug.

NCT00005666,Utility of Anatometabolic Imaging for Radiation Treatment Planning for Lung Cancer,"
      This is a research study for patients with inoperable lung cancer called non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC). Currently, the information from a radiological test, computed tomography
      (CT) scan of the chest, is used to design the best arrangement of radiation beams which will
      kill tumor cells and still spare the normal parts of lungs and other normal organs in the
      chest. The purpose of this study is to explore whether adding information from another
      radiological test, called positron emission tomography (PET), will improve the accuracy of
      the radiation beam arrangement designed to treat lung cancer. A PET scan is a way to picture
      the biochemistry of tissues and organs: of how tissues in the body take up glucose, a normal
      nutrient of the body. The researchers will attempt to create radiation treatment plans from
      PET images alone and compare differences between hypothetical plans and standard-of-care
      CT-based radiation treatment plans. Because there is honest uncertainty about the
      contribution of PET to radiation treatment planning, it is possible that there will be no
      difference between a CT-based treatment plan and one resulting from PET information. It is
      also possible that the addition of PET may result in a radiation beam arrangement that may
      better control lung cancer. The addition of PET may also result in treating less normal
      tissues, which may lower the risk of radiation side effects. This study will provide the
      preliminary data necessary to design a larger clinical trial that may define the role of PET
      in radiation treatment planning.

      reasoning, social behavior, and memory are the critical parts of cognition that make up
      daily life. This study will explore the association between performance on various
      experimental tasks and day-to-day functioning.

      Healthy normal volunteers and patients with certain kinds of brain damage (primarily focal
      or degenerative lesions of the human prefrontal cortex) or psychiatric disorders may be
      eligible for this study. Candidates with central nervous system trauma, disease or
      dysfunction will be screened with a routine neurological examination and history.

      Participants may be asked to complete written tests, sit in front of a computer monitor and
      press a key to indicate a decision about what appears on the screen (for example, whether a
      statement is accurate) and answer questions from a test examiner. A skin conductance
      response (SCR) test may be done along with some of the cognitive tests. SCR uses electrodes
      (pieces of metal attached to wires) placed on the fingers to measure the subject's emotional
      reaction to a test. Participants may also do an evoked response test, in which the subject
      watches words or scenes on a TV screen while his or her responses are recorded from
      electrodes placed on the scalp (similar to an electroencephalogram). The tests will be
      scheduled for an average of one session a week, with each session lasting from 30 minutes to
      3 hours. Generally, 15 sessions will be scheduled over a 1-year period. Special arrangements
      will be made to accommodate participants from out-of-town.

      Participants may have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain. This test uses

NCT00088569,Effect of Direct Current Polarization on Brain Function,"
      This study will test a new electrical technique called direct current (DC) polarization that
      is able to change brain activity in subtle ways for a short time. A recent study showed
      that, depending on its direction, the current could make people perform a little better or
      perhaps slightly worse on a test of the function of the brain's frontal lobe. This study
      will use positron emission tomography (PET) scanning to examine how DC polarization affects
      brain activity.

      Healthy volunteers between 20 and 70 years of age who are right handed and who are not
      taking any medications that affect the brain may be eligible for this study. Candidates are
      screened with a brief medical history and neurological evaluation.

      Participants have a PET scan on three different days at least 3 days apart. Each scanning
      session takes 2-1/2 to 3 hours. For the scan, radioactive water is injected into the body
      through a vein. Subjects lie on a bed that slides in and out of the doughnut-shaped scanner,
      with their head held from the back by a padded holder and in front by a custom-molded
      plastic mask with holes for the eyes, nose, and mouth. DC electrodes made of wet sponges are
      placed on the right side of the head and over the left eye and are held in place with
      elastic bandages.

      Three kinds of DC polarization are tested. In two tests the current is the same, but in
      opposite directions. The third is a sham (placebo) condition with no current delivered. Each
      of the three scans is separated by at least 3 days. On each day, a series of scans is done
      in a single session. Before each injection of tracer, the DC current is turned on. This may
      cause a tingling or slight burning on the skin under the electrodes, which disappears when
      the current is turned off. In each session, the subject receives 16 injections of tracer
      about 8 minutes apart, with DC polarization turned on for 4 out of the 8 minutes.

      During most of the 8-minute periods, subjects are shown a pattern of dots about every 2
      seconds. Sometimes the subject just looks at the patterns, and sometimes subjects are asked
      to push a button corresponding to the pattern they saw just before the current one.
      Sometimes they will be asked to push a button corresponding to the pattern that came before
      that one and so on, up to three patterns before the current one. The task lasts for about 2
      minutes each time, with time to relax in between.

NCT00128986,Study of Tomotherapy in Patients With Benign Brain Tumour,"
      Although malignant brain tumors are the most common type of primary brain tumor, there are a
      number of other benign brain tumors that exist. Many difficulties exist with treating these
      tumors that have led to controversies in the best treatment. A common issue among these
      brain tumors is the risk of long term side effects from treatment. What limits the use of
      curative radiation therapy is the ability to deliver a maximal dose to the tumor while
      minimizing the amount of radiation to the normal structures in the brain. A new method of
      delivering radiation, called tomotherapy, has been acquired at the Cross Cancer Institute
      (CCI) and will be used in this study. It has the ability to deliver a high dose of radiation
      to the tumor while minimizing the amount of radiation to normal brain structures. This study
      will use this method of radiation therapy to deliver radiation and see if the long term side
      effects from radiation therapy can be reduced.

NCT00193765,Elective vs Therapeutic Neck Dissection in Treatment of Early Node Negative Squamous Carcinoma of Oral Cavity,"
      Cervical metastasis is the single most important prognostic factor in head and neck cancers.
      Appropriate management of the neck is therefore of paramount importance in the treatment of
      these cancers. While it is obvious that the positive neck must be treated, controversy has
      always surrounded the clinically node negative neck with respect to the ideal treatment
      policy.The situation is difficult with regards to early cancers of the oral cavity (T1/T2).
      These cancers are usually treated with surgery where excision is through the per-oral route.
      Elective neck dissection in such a situation is an additional surgical procedure with its
      associated costs, prolonged hospitalization and may be unnecessary in as high as 80% of
      patients who finally turn out to be pathologically node negative. Should the neck be
      electively treated or there be a wait and watch policy? Current practice is that the neck is
      always addressed whenever there is an increased propensity to cervical metastasis or when
      patient follow-up is unreliable.

      There is clearly a need therefore for a large randomized trial that will resolve the issue
      either way once and for all.

      Primary Objective:

      To demonstrate whether elective neck dissection (END) is equal or superior to the wait and
      watch policy i.e.

NCT00202176,Effects of Bronchodilators in Mild Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD),"
      In people with mild COPD, the ability to exhale air from the lungs is partly limited because
      of narrowing and collapse of the airways. This results in the trapping of air within the
      lungs and over-distention of the lungs and chest (lung hyperinflation).

      Breathing at high lung volumes (hyperinflation) is an important cause of breathing
      discomfort (dyspnea) in people with COPD. Bronchodilators help to relax muscles in the
      airways or breathing tubes. Bronchodilators are often prescribed if a cough occurs with
      airway narrowing as this medication can reduce coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath.
      Bronchodilators can be taken orally, through injection or through inhalation and begin to
      act almost immediately but with the effect only lasting 4-6 hours. The main purpose of this

NCT00517959,SCRT Versus Conventional RT in Children and Young Adults With Low Grade and Benign Brain Tumors,"
      Brain tumours are the commonest solid tumours in children and the second most common
      neoplasms overall in this patient population. Radiotherapy plays an important part in the
      management in a majority of these tumours. While the cure rates of these tumours, especially
      the benign and low grade ones are quite encouraging, the treatment itself may lead to some
      late sequelae, which could have significant implications in the quality of life in these
      long-term survivors.

      Stereotactic conformal radiotherapy (SCRT) is a modern high-precision radiotherapy
      technique, which reduces the volume of normal brain irradiated and has the capability to
      minimise the doses to critical structures. The present study is designed to prospectively
      estimate the incidence and severity of neuropsychological, cognitive and neuroendocrine
      dysfunction following radiotherapy delivered with conventional and stereotactic techniques
      and would be one of the most comprehensive studies providing very important longitudinal and
      reliable data regarding these sequelae. The study involving 200 patients would be to the
      best of our knowledge not only the largest ever study conducted so far but also the only
      randomised trial assessing these sequelae in patients receiving focal brain irradiation.

      The study also examines whether the physical advantages of modern technological progress
      translate in clinical benefit. This could have significant implications in the
      radiotherapeutic management of children and young adults with brain tumours. The study is

      In recent years, more and more people are having lung CT scans performed to screen for
      various cancers. Many of them have small abnormalities detected, called ""nodules"", which -
      for a variety of reasons - doctors are unable to biopsy. As a result, many patients have
      their CT scans repeated on a regular basis to see if their nodules grow. This process can
      last several years.

      Many patients experience significant anxiety during this process, when they are aware of a
      spot in the lung, but are not told any specific cause.

      Researchers at Memorial Sloan-Kettering have developed a new way to look at lung nodules in
      three dimensions. The purpose of this project is to see if any change in the nodules can be
      detected sooner by this method than by traditional CT scans.

NCT00629460,A Pilot Study of PET-CT in the Assessment of Pulmonary Nodules in Children With Malignant Solid Tumors,"
      Because the management of children with solid tumors hinges on the extent of disease, it is
      crucial to identify metastatic sites. Helical chest computed tomography (CT) is the standard
      method of excluding pulmonary metastases. However, CT lacks molecular information regarding
      nodule histology and often biopsy is required to exclude malignancy. Biopsy procedures carry
      known risks including those associated with anesthesia and sedation, infection,
      pneumothorax, hemorrhage, pain and other post-procedure and post-operative complications and
      may also add unnecessary cost to the management of the patient. We found that the ability of
      three experienced pediatric radiologists to correctly predict nodule histology based on CT
      imaging features was limited (57% to 67% rate of correct classification). Also, there was
      only slight to moderate agreement in nodule classification between these reviewers.

      Furthermore, of 50 children who have undergone pulmonary nodule biopsy at St. Jude in the
      last five years, 44% (22/50) had only benign nodules.

      Adult studies have shown that a nuclear medicine scan called fluoro-deoxyglucose (FDG)
      positron emission tomography (PET) and the fusion modality PET-CT are superior to diagnostic
      CT in distinguishing benign from malignant pulmonary nodules because FDG PET gives
      information about the metabolic activity of the nodule. Nodules that are malignant have more
      metabolic activity, hence more FDG uptake/intensity, than those that are benign. There has
      been little work done in children to determine the value of PET or PET-CT in the evaluation
      of pulmonary nodules.

      Although stress ulcer is a complication that can cause mortality and morbidity in critical
      patients, there is still lack of consensus about its prophylaxis. There is also few data
      available from Taiwan. H2 blockers are commonly used due to convenience. Some prefer
      sucralfate (a mucosal protective agent) for the sake of less associated nosocomial
      pneumonia. Recently, proton pump inhibitors were shown to have good prophylactic effects for
      stress ulcer. Esomeprazole, an isoform of omeprazole, has good acid suppression effect and
      the tablets are soluble for the use of tube feeding. Our previous study showed that there
      was no difference for the efficacy of stress ulcer prophylaxis between esomeprazole and
      sucralfate in patients admitted to medical ICU with at least one risk factor. The prevalence
      of nosocomial pneumonia was also similar.

      prophylaxis. There are also few data available from Taiwan. H2 blockers are commonly used
      due to convenience. Some prefer sucralfate (a mucosal protective agent) for the sake of less
      association with nosocomial pneumonia. Recently, proton pump inhibitors were shown to have
      good prophylactic effects for stress ulcer. Pantoprazole (iv) is the first intravenous form
      of proton pump inhibitor that was approved by FDA. There are some reports about its
      application for treatment of peptic ulcer bleeding. It also has good acid suppression effect

NCT01028417,Study to See if Microcoil Insertion Reduces the Rate of Open Thoracotomy for Removal of Lung Nodules,"
      LAY ABSTRACT

        1. Statement of the health problem or issue: Of the estimated 24,000 Canadians who will be
           diagnosed with lung cancer in 2008, 21,000 will die of their disease. Based on this
           cancer incidence and survival data, the most promising current strategy for improving
           outcome is screening and early detection. It is suggested that if lesions are
           discovered at an earlier stage of disease, they will have a higher likelihood of being
           treatable and therefore, survival will be improved. CT detection of growing small lung
           nodules, many of which are non-cancerous (benign), raises the possibility of lung
           cancer and thus causes anxiety in patients and referring clinicians. Unfortunately,
           confident separation of benign from malignant small lung nodules cannot be reliably
           achieved using CT or PET criteria. Pathologic diagnosis using needle or excision biopsy
           is usually required.

           Excision biopsy removes the entire nodule at one setting and eliminates the sampling
           error associated with needle biopsy, making it appealing to physicians and patients. To
           reduce post-operative pain and breathing difficulties, excision biopsy is often
           performed using minimally invasive surgery (video assisted thoracoscopic surgery,
           VATS). Finding small pulmonary nodules is often difficult with the minimally invasive
           camera (VATS) and a bigger incision (thoracotomy) is necessary in more than 60% of our
           patients.

           We recently developed a technique of using platinum micro-coils, which are inserted in
           the lung nodule using CT guidance, to locate the nodule with fluoroscopy and then
           excise it with VATS. We have completed a pilot study (n=75 nodules; 69 patients) to
           determine the effectiveness of this technique. Seventy three (97%) 4-24-mm nodules were
           successfully removed at fluoroscopically guided VATS excision.

        2. Objective of your project: To improve our ability to successfully excise small growing
           lung nodules with minimally invasive VATS surgery using CT guided micro-coil
           localization techniques.

        3. How will you undertake your work? We propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial
           to determine if the use of CT guided platinum microcoil markers for VATS excision of
           subcentimetre pulmonary nodules can reduce the rate of conversion to open thoracotomy
           from 50% to 10%.

        4. What is unique/innovative about your project? New image guided minimally invasive
           surgical technique for removing early growing cancers was developed at the Vancouver
           General Hospital and the University of British Columbia. This has been published in
           peer-reviewed journals and can potentially allow us to accurately locate and excise
           suspicious lung nodules

        5. Relevance to Lung Association's mission statement? Lung cancer remains a major health
           problem in Canada. Early detection and screening programs allow for discovery of
           nodules when they are still very small and therefore, likely curable. Excision biopsy
           removes the entire nodule at one setting and eliminates the sampling error associated
           with needle biopsy, making it appealing to patients and physicians. To reduce post
           operative morbidity, costs and volume of lung removed, excision biopsy is often
           performed using video assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) techniques. Using a pilot
           project grant from the BC Lung Association we have developed a new technique that
           allows preoperative CT marking of the nodule and minimally invasive removal of the
           lesion. We hope that this technique will allow earlier treatment of lung cancers and
           improve survival in this devastating disease.

      Lung cancer remains the leading cause of mortality from malignant diseases in both men and
      women worldwide. Following thoracic surgery and pulmonary resection, patients have a
      surgically induced pneumothorax / hydro-hemothorax and hence tube thoracostomy is necessary
      to drain the air and effusion. Due to this, patients must undergo post-operative chest x-ray
      (CXR) evaluations in order to evaluate the chest and make decisions regarding removal of
      chest tubes (CT) as well as for decisions regarding patient discharge. Thoracic Ultrasound
      (US) has been shown to be accurate at diagnosing pneumothorax and has been well-studied in

NCT01201824,Thoracoscopic Localization of Pulmonary Nodules Using Direct Intracavitary Thoracoscopic Ultrasound,"
      Pulmonary nodules are one of the most common thoracic radiographic abnormalities. They are
      usually found accidentally as discrete well emarginated pulmonary lesions found within the
      lung parenchyma during a routine chest x-ray. Pulmonary nodules are usually asymptomatic.
      Most solitary lung nodules are benign; however these nodules can represent early stage lung
      cancer. The identification of malignant pulmonary nodules is important because they
      represent a potential form of curable lung malignancy. Every lung nodule should therefore be
      investigated for the possibility of malignancy.

      Ultrasound has been beneficial in almost all medical and surgical specialities. The idea of
      using ultrasound during VATS has emerged from its use in laparoscopic procedures. Few
      studies have investigated the use intracavitary ultrasound for localizing pulmonary nodules.
      The sensitivity of ultrasound detecting pulmonary nodules is high (92%). In some studies,
      ultrasound could detect all pulmonary nodules detected by high resolution CT. It has also
      been shown to be able to locate nodules not visualized on spiral CT.

      The use of intracavitary ultrasound has been suggested by many authors as a safe and
      effective method for localizing hard to find nodules. It is a real time technique with no
      associated complications, low cost, and has the potential to save operative time. Most
      importantly, it may be able to prevent conversion of VATS to open operations in cases where
      nodules are not visualizable or locatable using VATS techniques.

      The use of intracavitary US as a localization method by surgeons intra-operatively could
      lead to better identification of nodules. Also, this technique could avoid performing
      multiple procedures on patients (CT guided targeting followed by surgery) and therefore is
      more cost-efficient. If proven accurate, surgeon-performed intracavitary ultrasound could be
      used routinely during VATS procedures, increasing the chances of finding and localizing
      pulmonary nodules using minimally invasive techniques.

NCT01354912,The Incidence of Nontuberculous Mycobacterial Pulmonary Infection in Bilateral Bronchiectasis and Bronchiolitis,"
      Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are ubiquitous organisms in the environment and are now
      increasingly being recognized as significant causes of chronic pulmonary infection in
      immunocompetent individuals (1). The most frequently encountered NTM lung disease worldwide
      is caused by Mycobacterium avium-intracellular complex (MAC) (2-4).

      In several studies with chest computed tomography (CT), researchers have demonstrated that
      the presence of bilateral multifocal bronchiolitis (well-defined small nodules and branching
      centrilobular nodules, or tree-in-bud pattern) and bronchiectasis distributed mainly in the
      right middle lobe and lingular segment are indicative of NTM pulmonary infection (7-11).
      Accordingly, it is believed that radiologic findings of bilateral bronchiolitis and
      bronchiectasis on chest CT scans specifically suggest NTM pulmonary infection (1). These CT
      findings, however, may not be specific for NTM pulmonary infection. CT patterns of
      bronchiectasis and bronchiolitis in the pulmonary infections caused by various NTM organisms
      have been reported, and these organisms include Mycobacterium kansasii, Mycobacterium
      xenopi, and rapidly growing mycobacteria such as Mycobacterium abscessus, Mycobacterium
      fortuitum, and Mycobacterium chelonae (12-14). In addition, not all patients with
      bronchiectasis and bronchiolitis have NTM pulmonary infection. Two recent studies showed
      that only about 50% of patients with such CT features have MAC pulmonary infection (9,15).
      To the best of our knowledge, however, there is no report about the incidence of NTM in
      patients with bronchiectasis or bronchiolitis in countries with low incidence of TB. Thus,
      the purpose of our study was to determine the frequency of NTM pulmonary infection in
      patients with bilateral bronchiectasis and bronchiolitis at chest CT and to investigate
      whether these CT findings are specifically indicative of MAC infection or other specific
      pathogen.

NCT01572571,Ultrasound in Undifferentiated Hypotension,"
      Background

        -  Symptomatic undifferentiated hypotension represents a negative prognostic factor and
           the strongest predictor of in-hospital mortality.

        -  Misdiagnosis may lead to delayed or incorrect treatment of some life-threatening
           conditions.

      Aim

      - The aim of the study is to evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of a new bedside
      ultrasound method that consists in the focused imaging of the thorax, abdomen and leg veins,
      in emergency.

      Methods

        -  Hypotensive (<100 mm/Hg) patients presenting to our emergency department, complaining
           of at least one of the neurologic, respiratory and cutaneous signs and symptoms of
           inadequate tissue perfusion, are prospectively studied by ultrasound-focused assessment
           of the heart, lungs, inferior vena cava, peritoneum, aorta and leg deep veins.

        -  On the basis of physical examination and ultrasound results, the operator declares the
           diagnostic hypothesis without influencing the attending physician and the following
           diagnostic procedure (which includes ultrasound, when needed).

        -  The diagnostic hypothesis is compared with the final diagnosis, obtained after the
           hospital route and discussed by a panel of three blinded experts (one radiologist, one
           cardiologist and one emergency physician).

        -  The statistical agreement is calculated by the k of Cohen with p-value, confidence
           intervals and raw agreement (Ra).

NCT01572584,Lung Ultrasound in the Evaluation of Pneumothorax Size,"
      Background

        -  Assessment of the percentage of lung collapse is crucial in the therapeutic
           decision-making of pneumothorax.

        -  The methods normally used to this purpose are radiological. Computerized tomography
           scan (CT) is highly accurate because it allows the exact evaluation of the volume of
           the air layer. However, in clinical practice assessment of the volume of pneumothorax
           mainly relies on the measurement of the inter-pleural distance at conventional chest
           radiography (CXR). This latter method is inaccurate.

        -  Lung ultrasound is a new method highly accurate in the first diagnosis of pneumothorax,
           with a sensitivity superior to CXR and similar to CT in case of traumatic pneumothorax.

        -  The scientific community is actually debating about the usefulness of lung ultrasound
           in the quantification of pneumothorax []. Lung ultrasound can assess the superficial
           extension of the pneumothorax, but cannot evaluate its volume.

      Aim

        -  Main purpose of the study is to compare measurement of the superficial extension of
           pneumothorax on the chest wall obtained by lung ultrasound, to the evaluation of the
           air volume performed by CT in patients with pneumothorax.

        -  The main hypothesis of the study is that the cut-off between small (<11% of lung
           collapse) and large (>11% of lung collapse) pneumothorax can be identified by a lung
           ultrasound evaluation of the superficial extension of pneumothorax.

        -  Second purpose of the study is to compare the accuracies of lung ultrasound and CXR in
           predicting the volume of pneumothorax assessed by CT.

        -  Secondary hypothesis is that lung ultrasound demonstrates greater accuracy in the
           prediction of volume of pneumothorax and percentage of lung collapse.

      Methods

        -  Patients with a diagnosis of pneumothorax confirmed at CT are prospectively enrolled
           and submitted to lung ultrasound within 20 min from the CT study.

        -  Different locations of the sonographic ""lung point"" on the chest wall (i.e. the point
           on the chest wall where the sonographic pattern of the normally aerated lung alternates
           with the pathologic sonographic pattern of pneumothorax) are compared with different
           volumes of pneumothorax measured by CT.

NCT01586611,A Study to See if hENT1 Testing on Tumour Tissue Can Predict Response to Treatment With Gemcitabine Chemotherapy and if a Different Chemotherapy Called FOLFOX is Better Than Gemcitabine in Metastatic Pancreas Cancer,"
      Chemotherapy is often used to help shrink the cancer temporarily and may improve survival
      for patients with incurable pancreas cancer that has spread to other organs. In Canada, the
      gemcitabine chemotherapy is used to treat pancreas cancer that has spread. The combination
      of oxaliplatin with other chemotherapies, including 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and
      irinotecan has also been studied and has benefit for patients with advanced pancreas cancer.
      To date, there is no test that can be done on a patient's tumour to tell if chemotherapy
      will work in pancreatic cancer. Human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (hENT1) has
      been shown to be a possible predictor that gemcitabine may or may not work but this needs to
      be proven in a randomized study where patients get treated with gemcitabine or a different
      kind of chemotherapy while their tumours get tested for hENT1.

      This study is being done because we want to prove that hENT1 can predict if gemcitabine will
      work in advanced pancreas cancer and if it can, we also would like to show that a different
      chemotherapy combination called FOLFOX (a combination of 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and
      oxaliplatin) will be helpful for patients whose tumours don't have hENT1.

NCT01605214,Measurement of Extravascular Lung Water to Detect and Predict Primary Graft Dysfunction Following Lung Transplant,"
      Primary graft dysfunction (PGD) is the most common cause of early morbidity and mortality
      following lung transplant and is characterized by acute lung injury and capillary leak
      leading to an increase in extravascular lung water index (ELWI) and impaired graft function.
      PGD has many features in common with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). PGD may be
      life-threatening and can also lead to impaired long term lung function. In ARDS, a
      restrictive fluid strategy has been associated with an improvement in lung function and
      outcomes. Accurate methods of evaluating, quantifying and guiding the hemodynamic / fluid
      management and limiting the extent of ELWI that accumulates in the setting of PGD are
      lacking. Using transpulmonary thermodilution to estimate ELWI and the pulmonary permeability
      index (PPI) represents a novel approach to fluid management, which has been used in patients
      with ARDS, but to date not in the transplant setting. To determine if these measurements may
      better guide the management of lung transplant patients, the investigators first wish to
      establish whether these methods are able to predict the onset of clinical pulmonary edema
      earlier, whether they correlated with traditional markers of PGD, and whether they may be
      useful for predicting outcomes.

      AIM 1: The investigators will evaluate the correlation between ELWI and current surrogates
      of pulmonary edema in lung transplant patients with and without Primary Graft Dysfunction
      (PGD)

      AIM 2: The investigators will correlate the use of ELWI and PPI to determine the presence
      and severity of PGD.

      AIM 3: a) The investigators will determine whether early measurements of ELWI and PPI can
      predict the onset of PGD.

      b) Across different strata of PGD, the investigators will determine whether ELWI and PPI
      have a differential effect on duration of mechanical ventilation.

      The results of the study will be used for the following:

        1. Provide the rationale for routine monitoring of ELWI to detect PGD if found to be more
           discriminatory and have a stronger association with outcome compared to the current
           gold standard.

        2. Provide the means of early identification of those as risk of developing PGD in order
           to guide management decisions or future therapeutic interventions aimed at preventing
           or treating PGD.

        3. Provide the requisite groundwork for a clinical trial comparing the effects of an
           ELWI-driven protocol versus usual care on ICU outcomes in lung transplant recipients.

NCT01649752,Role of Stem Cells in Improving Implantation Rates in ICSI Patients,"
      Background:

      Improving implantation rates in ICSI cycles has been the focus of research in recent
      decades. Because success rates is not satisfactory enough especially when transferring good
      embryos to the uterine cavity and pregnancy does not occur. Trying to improve endometrial
      receptivity, the investigators have thought about stem cell therapy as stem cells have
      played a pivotal role in regenerative medicine in many pathologies as myocardial infarction,
      Diabetes Mellitus and spinal cord injuries.

      Garget and Healy reported in 2011 treatment of a case with Asherman's syndrome by
      administration of bone marrow stem cells in the uterine cavity. Endometrial growth and
      improved vascularity has been observed by ultrasound follow-up and Doppler study of
      endometrial blood flow. Endometrial regeneration has been enough to support pregnancy
      through successful IVF trial.

      The investigators have succeeded in previous work to isolate MSC from placental tissue and
      differentiate it to endometrium-like cells. The investigators compared the differentiation
      ability of placental derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and Wharton Jelly derived MSC to
      differentiate to endometrium under 3 different culture conditions: endometrium conditioned
      medium (ECM), follicular fluid (FF) conditioned medium and medium containing both. The
      investigators found that placental MSC has better differentiating ability to endometrium
      especially under culture conditions containing both ECM and FF as evidenced by prominent
      appearance of glandular pattern and expression of progesterone receptors in differentiated
      cells.

      Therefore the investigators need to direct this study and test the effect of placental
      derived MSC in improving implantation rates in patients with recurrent implantation failure,
      unresponsive endometrium to ovulation induction drugs or with endometrial atrophy or
      advanced maternal age planning for ICSI trial.

      Patients and Methods:

      60 patients attending Kasr El-Aini assisted reproduction unit and private IVF center will be
      randomized to three groups by computer generated programs:

      The first group, patients randomized to receive differentiated stem cell therapy:

      After ovum pick-up, MSC differentiated to endometrium is deposited in the uterine cavity
      through an IUI catheter. Embryo transfer will be done at day 5 at the blastocyst stage to
      allow enough time for endometrial regeneration and increased endometrial receptivity.

      The second group, patients randomized to receive undifferentiated stem cell therapy:

      Immediately postmenstrual undifferentiated MSC is deposited in the uterine cavity through an
      IUI catheter to allow enough time for the MSC to differentiate as it needs 7-10 days for
      differentiation. Ovum pick-up will be done as usual while all other steps will be the same
      including embryo transfer which will be done at day 5.

      The third group, control group:

      Patients are randomized to receive no stem cell therapy; All ICSI steps from ovulation
      induction protocol to embryo transfer conditions will be the same for all groups.

      Informed consent will be taken from the patients after detailed explanation of all steps of
      the procedure.

NCT02013063,Single Pulmonary Nodule Investigation,"
      A small proportion of patients with lung cancer present with a solitary pulmonary nodule
      (SPN). This is an important group of patients because if it is lung cancer, presentation as
      a SPN represents early disease, which following surgery has a high 5 year survival rate.
      However as not all SPNs are lung cancer it would be unethical to biopsy every case. Clinical
      guidelines recommend that SPNs should undergo an initial (FDG)-PET/CT scan, which may give
      more information about the SPN and may indicate if it is likely to be lung cancer. However
      in many cases it does not and current practice is to monitor the SPN with a series of CT
      scans over 2 years to look for changes or growth which may/ but not always indicate lung
      cancer. If no changes are observed over 2 years the SPN is considered not lung cancer. This
      is both expensive for the National Health Service (NHS) and worrying for the patient in
      terms of monitoring CT costs and delayed treatment due to length of time to diagnosis.

      This study examines the diagnostic capacity of using a different CT scan. Dynamic Contrast
      Enhanced -CT(DCE-CT). DCE-CT and FDG-PET/CT scans give different information about the SPN
      and the investigators will look to see if information from either scan or combined
      information from both scans may be better in the diagnosis of early stage lung cancer. The
      investigators will also undertake a review of previous studies that have used these scans
      and use data from both the review and the trial to look at the cost effectiveness of using
      DCE-CT in the diagnosis of SPN.

      The trial will recruit 375 people who have a SPN detected by a normal CT scan which requires
      a FDG-PET/CT scan. In addition they will receive a DCE-CT scan either on the same day or
      within three weeks of the FDG-PET/CT scan. This is the only extra procedure that will take
      place to normal NHS care, however we will collect clinical and outcome data over the next
      two years.

NCT02022371,Prostate Cancer Genomic Heterogeneity,"
      The purpose of this study is to carry out very detailed genetic testing on prostate cancer
      cells. The reason to do this is because researchers do not fully understand

        -  How prostate cancer develops

        -  Why some cancer cells spread and others do not

        -  Why some cancer cells respond to treatment and others do not

      Researchers and doctors know that 1 in 3 of the male population over the age of 50 has
      cancer cells in their prostate. However, most of these men will never know they have it and
      it will not affect their quality of life or their life expectancy. However, some cancers can
      be aggressive. These are more likely to spread outside of the prostate and cause problems.
      Doctors do not have an accurate way to tell the difference between aggressive cancer and
      those which will not cause any problems. Even within one prostate some tumours are
      aggressive and others do not cause a problem during the lifetime of a patient. In fact, even
      within one tumour, different cells may behave differently. In other words, one part of the
      tumour may be aggressive and spread, whilst another part of the same tumour does not. This
      project will try to find out more about what makes different tumours and different parts of
      the same tumour aggressive or harmless.

      It is important to find out what makes some cancer cells spread and others stay where they
      are. For the investigators to do this they need to collect fresh samples of cancer tissue
      from the prostate and from different areas of a tumour within the prostate. This is because
      biopsies used to diagnose or exclude cancer by the hospital laboratory are not good enough
      to give investigators detailed genetic information. These biopsies have been put into a
      chemical called formalin which reduces the quality of the genetic information.

      Investigators are therefore asking patients who are undergoing prostate biopsies as part of
      their normal care to allow them to take additional biopsies for the purpose of this study.
      This may be the first time patients are having biopsies. Or, patients may be having biopsies
      after treatment that has been given for the cancer and the doctors are concerned the
      treatment is not working.

NCT02081105,Validation of Digital Chest-X-ray (CXR) to Assess Lung Recruitment in ARDS,"
      Lung recruitability is essential for optimal Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)
      selection in ARDS patients. It is defined as the potential for the non aerated or poorly
      aerated lung mass to become aerated due to the increase in airway pressure. PEEP contributes
      to lung recruitment mostly by maintaining some amount of the end-inspiratory recruitment at
      the end of expiration. PEEP also stabilizes patency of the small airways and minimizes the
      repeated opening and closing of them during the breathing cycle, which is implicated in a
      further lung inflammation. The gold-standard method for assessing lung recruitability is
      lung CT scan. For economic and feasibility this technique cannot be used in routine.
      Therefore, techniques that can be used at the bedside to measure lung recruitability are
      very well known. The measurement of recruited lung volume (Vrec) by using pressure-volume
      curve generated by the ventilator is another reference method to approach lung recruitment.
      It can be done at the bedside. Chest-X-Ray (CXR) is an interesting option as done in routine
      in this setting. Furthermore, it allows quantifying aeration thanks numerical image
      processing and a regional approach. In a preliminary one-center study we found a significant
      negative correlation between the amount of Vrec and the reduction in lung density measured
      by digital CXR between 5 and 15 cm H2O PEEP. In present study we would like to extend this
      previous result on a larger number of patients in a multicenter investigation.

NCT02096445,Neurocognitive Robot-assisted Rehabilitation of Hand Function After Stroke,"
      The aim of this project is to clinically evaluate a novel robot-assisted therapeutic
      approach to train sensorimotor hand function after stroke. It combines the profound
      experience of the clinic Hildebrand in neurocognitive therapy - involving brain and mind in
      the task and training both the motor and the sensory system - with the advanced haptic
      robotic technology of the Rehabilitation Engineering Lab at the Swiss Federal Institute of
      Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich), allowing unmet interaction with the hand through the
      simulation of virtual objects with various mechanical properties. In a randomized controlled
      clinical trial, 10 sub-acute stroke patients will receive four weeks of robotic therapy
      sessions, integrated seamlessly into their daily rehabilitation program, while 10 other
      patients will receive conventional therapy. The investigators will assess baseline
      performance in an initial clinical and robotic assessment, with another assessment at the
      end of the four-week period, and in follow-ups four weeks and six months later. The contents
      of the patient-tailored robotic therapy sessions will match those of the conventional
      therapy as closely as possible. This study will demonstrate the feasibility of including
      robotic therapy of hand function into the daily rehabilitation program, and investigate the
      acceptance from patients and therapists. The investigators expect increased training
      intensity during the robotic therapy session compared to conventional sessions with similar
      contents, as well as novel insights into the recovery process of both the motor and the
      sensory system during the four weeks of therapy, through advanced robotic assessments
      integrated into the training sessions. This project is a first step towards making such
      robotic therapy available to patients as integration into the conventional individual
      therapy program (e.g. for self-training), and towards transferring this technology to the
      home environment.

NCT02137291,IPg2 Study: Left-sided Lung Isolation,"
      Lung isolation is primordial in thoracic surgery. To achieve it, two techniques are used:
      the double lumen tube (DLT) and the bronchial blocker (BB). Left-sided DLT (L-DLT) is use by
      the majority of anesthesiologists for both left and right thoracic surgeries. Standard
      right-sided DLT (Rs-DLT) is rarely use since it is dif¬ficult to properly position it and
      that there is a risk of misalignment between the lateral orifice of the tube and the origin
      of the right upper lobe (RUL) bron¬chus. In 2007, the investigators have published results
      suggesting enlarging the Rs-DLT's lateral orifice. The modified R-DLT (Rm-DLT) was more
      frequently in an adequate position: 77% vs 37% of patients (p = 0.0121), and easier to
      reposition: 97% vs 74% of patients (p= 0.0109) in comparison to the standard R-DLT group.
      The data suggest the superiority of the Rm-DLT compared to Rs-DLT for optimal positioning to
      facilitate one-lung ventilation (OLV) during thoracic surgery. It is believed that DLT tend
      to provide quicker and better quality of lung collapse than BB. In 2013, investigators have
      demonstrated an equivalent quality of lung collapse (LC) between L-DLT and BB used with two
      apnea periods when initiating OLV. Complementary analysis showed a significative difference
      to obtain complete LC (CLC) between L-DLT for left thoracoscopy and L-DLT for right
      thoracoscopy and BB in right or left surgery. The investigator hypothesis is that, when
      using L-DLT for left video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), LC of the isolated lung
      will be slower and of poorer quality compare to the use of the Rm-DLT. The primary objective
      is to compare the delay between pleural opening (PO) and CLC in left VATS when using three
      lung isolation devices: 1) L-DLT and 2) Rm-DLT. Secondary objectives are: 1) to evaluate
      quality of LC, 2) to evaluate the level of obstruction of the lumen of the left bronchus, 3)
      to evaluate the quality of OLV (PaO2) 4) To collect blind surgeon's opinion about de device
      used and 5) to measure the delay between OLV and PO for evaluating the role of absorption
      atelectasis in obtaining CLC. After obtaining IRB approval, the investigators propose a
      study of 40 patients undergoing an elective left VATS at IUCPQ involving one lung
      ventilation. They will have to be 21 years or more, to read, understand and sign an informed
      consent at their pre-operative evaluation. This study will be prospective, randomized, and
      blind to thoracic surgeons.

NCT02225392,Unravelling Targets of Therapy in Bronchial Thermoplasty in Severe Asthma,"
      Approximately 5% of asthma patients suffer from severe asthma that is characterized by
      frequent asthma exacerbations resulting in significant morbidity and excessive utilisation
      of health care resources. Therefore, there is a strong need for improved therapeutic
      strategies for these patients. Insight in the pathogenesis and molecular pathways active in
      severe asthma is crucial to reach this goal.

      Bronchial Thermoplasty (BT) is a novel, innovative device-based treatment of severe asthma
      that is based on local, radiofrequent energy delivery in larger airways during bronchoscopy.

      Hypothesis:

      BT-induced clinical improvement in severe asthma is a consequence of reduction in airway
      smooth muscle (ASM) mass and (contractile/immunomodulatory) function, inflammation, neural
      innervation and/or vascular integrity resulting in altered airway remodelling. BT target
      identification and severe asthma phenotyping are critical for improved patient selection for
      BT and fundamental to discover novel, specific signalling pathways active in severe asthma.

NCT02441478,Co-operative Behavior and Decision-making in Frontal Lobe Epilepsy,"
      Epilepsy is a frequent neurological disorder with about a third of patients having seizures
      despite treatment. At least some of these seizures can be linked to a low compliance and
      therapy adherence of patients. Compliance is defined as ""the extent to which a person's
      behavior (in terms of taking medication, following diets, or executing life style changes)
      coincides with medical or health advice"". Therapy adherence of patients suffering from
      epilepsy is low with reported rates between 30 and 50%, although adherence to anticonvulsive
      drug therapy is critical for effective disease management and low therapy adherence is
      associated to higher mortality in epilepsy. The reasons for low therapy adherence are still
      a matter of research. Some known factors influencing compliance in epilepsy are related to
      its chronic nature, but others seem to lie in a complex interaction between psychiatric
      comorbidity and an impairment of neural systems underlying behavior. Furthermore, therapy
      adherence rests a variable difficult to measure, especially in epileptic patients where
      classical tools such as questionnaires and electronic monitoring devices have been shown to
      be imprecise. It has been argued that the term 'compliance' should be replaced by
      'co-operative behavior' and non-compliance can therefore be interpreted as troubled
      co-operative behavior. This behavioral approach offers the potential of using tools and
      methods of the latest developments in behavioral neuroscience. Neuroeconomics, a scientific
      field on the border of psychology, economics and neuroscience, has used economic game
      paradigms in order to operationalize cooperative behavior and to identify several brain
      areas by functional brain imaging that have been linked to social co-operative behavior. The
      majority of these brain areas are located in the frontal cortex [ventromedial
      frontal/orbitofrontal cortex, and rostral anterior cingulate cortex. Epilepsies originating
      in the frontal lobe are subsumed under the term ""frontal lobe epilepsy"" (FLE) and represent
      20-30% of all partial seizures and 25% of all refractory focal epilepsies referred to
      epilepsy surgery.

      The investigator's project plans to study compliance and cooperative behavior of patients
      suffering from frontal lobe epilepsies through a neuroeconomic approach by (1) comparing the
      behavior of these patients in the prisoners' dilemma game to the behavior of age-, gender-,
      and education-matched healthy controls, (2) correlation of game behavior to brain activation
      measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging in both patients and healthy controls and
      (3) studying the link between cooperative behavior to compliance captured by pill counts and
      questionnaires.

NCT02505750,"Phase III Study Comparing, Efficacy and Safety of a Boost (CXB or EBRT) in Combination With Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy for Early Rectal Adenocarcinoma","
      Rationale - current state of knowledge Current guidelines for cT2-T3 (clinical stage T2 and
      T3) low and middle rectal cancer recommend radical total mesorectal excision (TME) surgery
      that may involves permanent stoma or a low anterior resection with sometimes poor bowel
      function.

      Randomised trials have shown that neoadjuvant (chemo)radiotherapy (nCRT) reduces the risk of
      local recurrence by more than half. At 3 years, it is close to or below 5% with acceptable
      toxicity at many centers. On the other hand, it provides no definite improvement in overall
      survival and does not increase the chances of conservative surgery.

      Rectal adenocarcinoma is rather radioresistant and the dose required to achieve 50%
      sterilization is close to 90 grays (Gy), which is a high dose causing toxicities when given
      with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT). Among the radiotherapy techniques able to
      achieve safely such a high dose, Contact X-Ray Brachytherapy 50 Kv (CXB) is an appealing
      method.

      The Lyon R96-2 randomised trial using CXB showed an increased clinical complete response
      (cCR) rate from 2% to 29% and an improvement by 30% the chance of avoiding a permanent stoma
      (72% vs. 42%). In addition, some patients achieving cCR were able to preserve not only the
      sphincter but the whole rectum (organ preservation) either after local excision or using
      only a ""watch and wait"" strategy.

      Such a conservative approach is receiving a growing interest all over the world among
      colorectal cancer specialists. The extensive and pioneering work of Prof. Habr Gama in
      Brazil is presently considered as a reference for the use chemoradiotherapy and an EBRT
      boost (total dose 54 Gy/30 f/6 weeks) followed by watch and wait in case of cCR to preserve
      organ, i.E. to avoid surgery.

      Research Hypothesis The investigators propose to conduct a randomised study on cT2, cT3a-b
      tumours less than 5 cm using two different techniques of radiotherapy boost following
      neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) (CAP45): EBRT (9 Gy/5 fractions) or CXB (90 Gy/3
      fractions). The endpoint will be organ preservation at 3 years without non-salvageable local
      pelvic recurrence. The proof of this concept will be of most benefit for all patients but
      especially for the elderly who usually are not fit for or keen to undergo major surgery.

      The hypothesis of this study is to determine whether the addition of an endocavitary boost
      with CXB after standard treatment with nCRT, increases the chance of rectum and anus
      preservation by 20%-unites in early rectal adenocarcinoma without locally progressive
      disease (organ preservation in control arm 20%, in experimental arm 40%).

      Main objective To demonstrate that neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in combination with a boost
      given with CXB (Arm B) is superior to the same neoadjuvant therapy plus a boost with EBRT
      alone (Arm A) in terms of rectum (organ) preservation without non salvageable local disease
      at 3 years post treatment start, or permanent deviating stoma.

      Study Design Open-label, phase III, prospective, multi-centre, international, randomised
      1:1, 2 arm study designed to evaluate the efficacy of a CXB boost versus an EBRT boost.

      Randomisation:

      Arm A: 3D conformal EBRT 45 Gy (1.8 Gy/fraction/5 weeks) with concurrent chemotherapy using
      capecitabine (825 mg/m2 bid, on radiation days).

      A cone down EBRT targeting the Gross Tumour Volume (GTV) will deliver a boost dose of 9 Gy
      in 5 fractions. On week 14 after the start of treatment, the tumour response evaluation will
      guide the final strategy: surgery (radical TME or local excision) or watch-and-wait (W-W).

      Arm B divided in 2 subgroups depending on the tumour diameter:

      B1: If the tumour is < 3 cm, a CXB boost dose (90Gy/3 fractions/4 weeks) will be initially
      delivered to the tumour. After 2 weeks rest, patients will receive 3D conformal EBRT 45 Gy
      (1.8 Gy/fraction/5 weeks) with concurrent chemotherapy using capecitabine (825 mg/m2 bid, on
      radiation days). Clinical evaluation will be performed 3 weeks after the end of irradiation
      (week 14) and will guide the final strategy (surgery or W-W) as in arm A.

      B2: If the tumour is ≥ 3 cm, patients will receive EBRT first 45 Gy (1.8 Gy/fraction/5
      weeks) with concurrent chemotherapy using capecitabine (825 mg/m2 bid, on radiation days).

      A CXB boost dose (90 Gy/3 fractions/4 weeks) will be delivered to residual tumour, after a
      rest of 2 weeks. On week 14 after the start of treatment, the tumour response evaluation
      will guide the final strategy (surgery or W-W) as in arm A. Adjuvant chemotherapy will be

NCT00603590,Phase II Study of Heart Polypill Safety and Efficacy in Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease,"
      Cardiovascular is a major cause of mortality in Iran, accounting for 45.7% of deaths. In
      Golestan (North Eastern Iran) preliminary findings from follow-up of the Golestan Cohort are
      consistent with national figures: with 45% (at least 22 of 48 deaths) of all deaths
      attributed to cardiovascular events. Cardiovascular diseases will become an increasing
      problem as the Iranian population ages.

      In 2003 Law and Wald proposed prevention of cardiovascular disease using fixed-dose
      combination therapy combining antihypertensive, lipid lowering and antiplatelet drugs in a
      single preparation. They proposed that this treatment should be offered to all persons at
      high risk of cardiovascular disease whether or not they have elevated blood pressure or
      elevated serum lipid concentrations.

      This pilot study aims to investigate the safety and efficacy of fixed-dose combination
      therapy with two antihypertensive drugs, aspirin and atorvastatin in a population who would
      not currently be considered eligible for antihypertensive treatment or for lipid lowering
      treatment.

      Methods:

      This is a double-blind randomized controlled trial. The intervention group will be assigned
      to take a tablet consisting of a single daily tablet comprising Aspirin 81mg,
      Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5mg, Enalapril 2.5mg and Atorvastatin 20mg. The control group will be
      assigned to an identical placebo.

      The population studied includes men aged 50 to 80 (inclusive) and women aged 55 to 80
      (inclusive) who are currently not eligible for or taking antihypertensive or lipid lowering
      therapy. Persons who are found at baseline to have blood pressure >160/100 mm Hg, total
      cholesterol >240mg/dL, existing cardiovascular disease or to be taking antihypertensive ore
      lipid lowering therapy are excluded.

      It is intended to randomize and follow up 500 subjects for 12 months. The primary outcome
      for the purpose of sample size calculation is change in systolic blood pressure. Additional
      outcomes include change in diastolic blood pressure, change in LDL cholesterol and
      occurrence of adverse events.

NCT00721006,Phase II Combination Stem Cell Therapy for the Treatment of Severe Leg Ischemia,"
      The purpose of this research study is to compare in patients with double-sided claudication
      if the transplant of a combination of stem cells obtained from the bone marrow of the same
      patient will contribute to the formation of new blood vessels in one of the severly diseased
      ischemic limbs(legs)versus the control limb that receives a placebo product.

      Limb Ischemia (LI) is a severe obstruction of the arteries which seriously decrease blood
      flow to the extremities (mainly feet and legs) and has progressed to the point of severe
      pain and even skin ulcers or sores.

      LI needs comprehensive treatment since the condition will not improve on its own. The
      overall goal of treatment is to reduce pain and increase blood flow to improve symptoms or
      save the leg and feet. In many cases, current options for treatment including medications,
      surgery or endovascular procedures have not been successful.

      In the last few years, investigators have explored therapies aimed to increase blood flow to
      the ischemic vessel by transplanting cells that will promote the development of new vessels
      in the diseased leg.

      The study hypothesis is based on the concept that the process of formation of new blood
      vessels is complex and requires the participation of several types of stem cells and growth
      factors. The lack of any of these components will produce vessels which are immature and
      unable to provide appropriated blood supply to the leg.

      Patients eligible to participate in the this study are those suffering from double-sided
      claudication with poor circulation or severe leg blockages, which are not candidates for
      surgical procedures.

      Once the mixture of stem cells is prepared and the patient's bone marrow is ready, cells
      will be transplanted into the calf muscle of one the the diseased legs while the other
      diseased leg will receive the placebo. Clinical study to evaluate and compare the efficacy
      of the stem cell transplant will be performed for six months post cell transplant.

NCT01625832,Effects of Coronary Sinus Occlusion on Myocardial Ischemia (Pilot Study),"
      Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in
      industrialized countries despite advances in medical, interventional, and surgical
      revascularization therapies. In both, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and chronic stable
      disease, standard therapeutic approaches may fail to restore tissue perfusion. Indeed, a
      substantial number of chronic CAD patients may not be amenable to standard revascularization
      therapies or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) may fail to restore coronary artery
      patency following an acute vessel occlusion (no-reflow phenomenon, microvascular
      obstruction). As a consequence, the long pursued strategy of augmenting myocardial perfusion
      by diverting blood from the coronary venous system to an ischemic region (venous
      retroperfusion) has again gained attention during recent years. Occlusion of the coronary
      sinus (CSO) was introduced to provide retroperfusion by transient augmentation of coronary
      venous pressure. Different devices using CSO have been invented and evaluated in animal
      models and small clinical trials, e.g. intermittent CSO (ICSO) and pressure-controlled
      intermittent CSO (PICSO) which seem to be effective for myocardial salvage. However, they
      are not yet employed in clinical routine, and importantly, the exact underlying mechanisms
      by which retroperfusion due to CSO may reduce myocardial ischemia are not yet understood.

      As ""natural bypasses"", coronary collaterals are anastomoses without an intervening capillary
      bed between portions of the same coronary artery or between different coronary arteries that
      represent an alternative source of blood supply to a myocardial area jeopardized by
      ischemia. Collaterals of the heart can be assessed quantitatively by coronary pressure
      measurements, which have become the gold standard (collateral flow index,
      CFI=[Poccl-CVP]/[Pao-CVP]). Theoretically, augmentation of coronary sinus pressure by CSO
      with an increase of venous backflow reaches the upstream collateral circulation, which in
      turn could lead to improved collateral flow from non-ischemic area(s) to an occluded,
      ischemic myocardial region by upstream flow diversion. On the other hand, when considering
      the formula to calculate pressure-derived CFI, it seems that augmentation of coronary back
      pressure would rather impair collateral flow (since central venous pressure is coronary
      sinus pressure). However, the regional effect of a global increase in coronary sinus
      pressure is unlikely to be as uniform as the above formula implies, i.e., the response is
      more pronounced in some than in other vascular territories. In experimental studies using
      dogs (with abundant collaterals), elevation of coronary sinus pressure caused an
      augmentation of regional myocardial blood flow in the collateralized area. In contrast, when
      ICSO was performed in pigs (which possess no preformed collaterals), it increased the
      pressure distal of an occluded LAD but did not improve blood flow or left ventricular
      function.

      In conclusion, experimental studies and pathophysiologic considerations suggest a necessary
      role of the collateral circulation for the beneficial effects of coronary sinus occlusion
      (CSO) observed in animals and humans; however, no clinical data are available so far on the
      effect of CSO on myocardial ischemia in the presence of varying collateral flow.

      Study hypotheses

        1. CSO decreases intra-coronary ECG ST-segment elevation during a 2-minute coronary
           occlusion.

        2. The decrease in occlusive intra-coronary ECG ST elevation during CSO is directly
           proportional to CFI.

        3. Coronary sinus oxygen saturation during coronary occlusion with CSO is directly
           proportional to CFI.

NCT01698853,Difference Between Central and Peripheral Arterial Blood Oxygen Saturation With Different CPB Strategy,"
      Femoro-femoral cardiopulmonary bypass with retrograde perfusion is needed for totally
      thoracoscopic cardiac surgery. one of the major complication of retrograde perfusion is
      organ hypoperfusion.

      Arterial blood gas analysis can help to detect hypoperfusion or hypoxia during retrograde
      perfusion. However,whether the arterial oxygenation status from different parts of the body
      are the same in the condition of retrograde perfusion have not been studied.

      The present study is aimed to determine if there is difference in the arterial oxygenation
      between peripheral arterial and aortic root during the period of retrograde perfusion.In
      addition, the impact of artificial ventilation on the difference of arterial oxygenation
      will also be investigated.

NCT01741896,Can Remote Ischaemic Preconditioning Reduce Contrast Induced Nephropathy in Patients Receiving Contrast for Computed Tomography?,"
      Computated tomography (CT) is an invaluable medical resource for both physicians and
      surgeons. Contrast media are an aid to improve the diagnostic yield of CT. While an
      incredibly powerful means of imaging the human body, there are possible complications to the
      use of contrast including a hypersensitive response and contract induced nephropathy (CIN).
      The latter will typically occur 48-72 hours after administration.

      One recent meta - analysis of serum creatinine levels following contrast enhanced CT found
      6.4% of those undergoing this investigation developed CIN. Although typically transient, 1 %
      had a persisting reduced renal function, with a small minority needing renal replacement
      therapy (RRT). The development of CIN was influenced by co morbidities and by the amount of
      contrast given.

      The mechanism of injury to the kidney is not definitively established, but is thought most
      likely due to hypoxia resulting from reduced blood flow, thereby giving rise to oxygen free
      radicals causing direct damage to the kidney and also direct tubular damage.

      Remote conditioning ischaemia has been hypothesized to be nephroprotective, whereby induced
      transient ischaemia at another site could buffer the impact of the contrast medium's
      effects. This was first demonstrated during cardiac angiograms, with those patients whom
      received multiple balloon inflations in the coronary arteries were found to have a lower
      incidence of CIN than those with fewer balloon inflations. Thus it could be hypothesised
      that any ischaemia temporarily induced could be nephroprotective. This can be at a point of
      extremity, rather than involving central organs, such as the arm, with ischaemia induced by
      the use of a blood pressure cuff, inflated to above systolic blood pressure levels.

      No studies have been found in the literature attempting to demonstrate this effect in
      relation to contrast CT studies. Consequently, a randomised control clinical trial of
      patients to assess the effectiveness of remote ischaemic preconditioning is proposed.

      Study Hypothesis: That performing remote ischaemic preconditioning on those undergoing CTs
      involving IV contrast is nephroprotective.

NCT02051088,Swedish Drug-elution Trial in Peripheral Arterial Disease,"
      Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) causes reduced blood flow to the lower limb(s) due to
      stenosis or occlusion in the supplying arteries. Symptoms of PAD range from ischemic rest
      pain and/or ischemic ulcers/gangrene (critical limb ischemia), putting the extremity at risk
      of amputation, to exercise-induced pain (intermittent claudication), limiting the patients
      daily activities. Invasive treatments are often indicated to prevent amputations and to
      alleviate symptoms. More than two thirds of these procedures are presently performed with
      endovascular techniques (i.e. percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, PTA with or without
      stent implantation).

      In coronary artery disease, stents eluting anti-proliferative drugs (drug eluting stents,
      DES) reduce restenosis and improve clinical results for the majority of patients. Drug
      eluting balloons (DEB) are a promising alternative, but there is still little evidence that
      DES or DEB technology improve clinical outcome in PAD. However, promising results utilizing
      these new technologies in PAD have been reported in a few studies.

      In this trial, we test the hypothesis that drug eluting (DE) technology is superior to
      conventional endovascular treatment (no-DE) in terms of important clinical outcomes, when
      applied on infrainguinal (femoropopliteal and/or infrapopliteal) obstructive vascular

      arterial stiffness has been established in previous studies among the hypertensive
      population. The present study is a comparison of the performance of two drugs, telmisartan
      and nebivolol, in 24h ambulatory blood pressure values and in the degree of arterial
      stiffness of patients with stage I arterial hypertension.

      Measurements will be carried out with the use of 24-h ambulatory blood pressure measurement
      devices and the method of pulse-wave velocity analysis. The effects of telmisartan and
      nebivolol are going to be compared for a total time period of 12 months.

      The aim of this project is to determine whether the expected decrease in arterial stiffness
      of subjects with stage I arterial hypertension can be attributed to the blood pressure fall
      solely, or to other factors as well. These factors are possibly dependent on the action of
      these drugs on the renin-angiotensin II-aldosterone system (RAAS) or on peripheral
      vasodilatory actions.

NCT02110251,Exercise Therapy With Risk Factor Management and Life Style Coaching After Vascular Intervention for Patients With Peripheral Arterial Disease,"
      Patients with peripheral arterial disease with symptoms of critical ischemia or reduced
      tissue loss have a very high mortality and morbidity rate. So far, treatment strategies
      focused on the preservation of life and limb by an open surgical or endovascular
      revascularization, together with cardiovascular risk management and pain relief. Important
      modifiable factors related to mortality and morbidity are not covered in the current
      national and international guidelines. This study investigates the effects on mobility,
      mortality and quality of life with supplementation of the standard treatment of critical
      limb ischemia with supervised exercise therapy. Also a reduction of cardiovascular risk by
      intensive risk factor management and lifestyle coaching will be taken in to account. The
      supervised exercise therapy will take place under the supervision of a trained
      physiotherapist.

NCT02273232,Effects of Remote Ischemic Preconditioning on Moderate PVD Patients A Pilot Randomized Control Trial,"
      Remote ischemic Preconditioning (RIPC) is a phenomena first observed in cardio-thoracic
      patients in which exposing the limbs for periods of short intermittent ischemia produces
      protective effect on heart muscle. The concept was applied to many other parts of the body
      and the results are positive so far.

      No human trials on this concept has been conducted in patients with peripheral vascular
      disease so far but applying the concept for healthy individuals shows vessels dilatation and
      animal trials shows degree of new vessels formation in addition to reports of symptoms
      improvement.

      The trial candidates will be allocated blindly in 4 groups. All groups will have advice
      about exercise which is the standard practice now. The first group will have supervised
      exercise. The second group will in addition to the supervised exercise get the ischemic
      preconditioning with the blood pressure cuff. The third group will get the ischemic
      preconditioning and the fourth group will get the standard exercise advice. All candidates
      will have Magnetic Resonance Image Scan (MRA) for their blood vessels in the beginning of
      the trial and again at the end.

NCT02427867,Ischaemic PReconditioning In Non Cardiac surgEry,"
      Several randomized trials suggested a cardioprotective beneficial effect (eg reduction in
      cardiac troponin release) of remote ischemic preconditioning in cardiac surgery.

      Remote ischemic preconditioning by brief episodes of ischemia and reperfusion in a remote
      organ or vascular territory provides protection from injury by myocardial ischemia and
      reperfusion. In the translation of remote ischemic preconditioning from bench to bedside,
      the first proof of principle and small randomized controlled trials have shown a decreased
      release of myocardial biomarkers after aortic, congenital cardiac, adult valve and coronary
      artery by-pass graft surgery. This reduction in cardiac biomarkers release translated into
      better survival in a recent randomized trial performed in cardiac surgery. No clinical trial
      on remote ischemic preconditioning in non-cardiac surgery setting has been performed so far.

      The investigators study wants to test, for the first time, the hypothesis that remote
      ischaemic preconditioning is effective in reducing cardiac damage in high risk patients
      undergoing non-cardiac surgery. Remote ischaemic preconditioning will be achieved by
      inflation of a blood-pressure cuff to 200 mm Hg to the upper arm for 5 minutes, followed by
      5 minutes reperfusion while the cuff will be deflated. Cardiac troponin will be used as
      marker of cardiac damage. If the results of a reduction in postoperative cardiac troponin
      release and perioperative cardiac ischaemic events will be confirmed in a non-cardiac
      surgery setting, the investigators could improve a strategy to prevent perioperative cardiac
      complication easy to apply, safe and low cost.

NCT02431819,Evaluation of the Safety of Compressive Socks to Treat Venous Insufficiency in Patients With Peripheral Arterial Disease,"
      Elastic compression stockings are recommended in the treatment venous insufficiency.
      Degressive compressive stockings have been used for many decades and are characterized by a
      high pressure applied at the ankle and a decreasing pressure from the ankle to the knee.
      Progressive compressive stockings were developed to have a maximal pressure at the calf.
      This concept is based on the calf pump role in the venous return. Patients with PAD
      (Peripheral Arterial Disease) often suffer from venous insufficiency. But elastic
      compression stockings are strictly contraindicated for patients with PAD because highest
      pressures on ankle could slow down the superficial microcirculation.

      On patients with PAD and venous insufficiency, the progressive compressive stockings could
      be well indicated. Strongest pressure at the calf should increase the pump effect and the
      muscle mechanical efficiency during the walk without deleterious effect.

NCT02516072,The Use of Remote Ischaemic Preconditioning in the Prevention of Contrast Induced Nephropathy in Patients Undergoing Elective Diagnostic or Therapeutic Peripheral Angiography: a Pilot Randomised Controlled Trial,"
      With an increasingly ageing population the incidence of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is
      rising. With approximately one quarter of all PAD patients ultimately progressing to
      Critical Limb Ischaemia (CLI), increased demands are being placed on vascular imaging to
      accurately assess stenotic lesions. Early infrainguinal lesions (i.e. TASC A & B) can be
      treated with angioplasty+/- stenting and accurate assessment relies on the imaging gold
      standard of angiography.

      Patients with PAD often have concomitant co morbidities such as diabetes and chronic renal
      impairment placing them at increased risk of developing contrast induced nephropathy (CIN)
      when exposed to iodinated contrast media. High risk individuals with decreased eGFR
      <60ml/min have a risk of between 20-30% of developing CIN. They have increased morbidity and
      mortality risks with a greater need for dialysis and prolonged in patient hospital stays.
      Ideally, the investigators should be searching for ways to decrease the incidence of CIN.
      Animal studies and more recently pilot human trials have shown that subjecting a remote
      vascular bed to a brief ischaemic stress, followed by a period of reperfusion; in what has
      been termed remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC), may confer a protective benefit against
      the development of CIN. This study aims to determine if RIPC can protect against CIN in
      patients undergoing elective peripheral angiography for infrainguinal disease.

NCT00044239,Characterization of Childhood-Onset Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder,"
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about Obsessive-compulsive Disorder (OCD) in
      children. OCD usually has a slow onset, and symptoms that may remain at a stable level over
      time. A subset of children with OCD has a sudden onset and symptoms that fluctuate in
      severity over time. This study will also compare healthy children to those with OCD. This is
      an observational study; children who participate will not receive any new or experimental
      therapies.

      OCD affects nearly 1% of the pediatric population. The symptoms of this illness can
      interrupt development, causing significant psychological distress and producing life-long
      impairments in social, academic, and occupational functioning. A subgroup of pediatric OCD
      has been designated by the acronym PANDAS (Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders
      Associated with Streptococcal Infections). This type of OCD is characterized by sudden
      symptom onset and a relapsing-remitting course of illness; exacerbation of symptoms occurs
      with scarlet fever or strep. throat infections. This study will identify factors that
      distinguish children with PANDAS OCD from children with non-PANDAS OCD, and will compare
      both groups to healthy children.

      Children with OCD and their parents are screened with interviews and a review of the child's
      medical records. Participants have an initial evaluation that includes a psychiatric,
      physical and neuromotor exam, neuropsychological testing, psychological interviews, and a
      blood test. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRS) scans of the brain are also
      obtained. The MRS scan does not use radiation.

      After the initial evaluation, children with OCD have follow-up visits every 6 weeks for 12
      to 24 months. They are seen yearly for 8 years after the study. If they have a significant
      improvement or worsening of their symptoms, they are asked to make a maximum of two extra
      visits. Parents of OCD patients are called four times a year to discuss any changes in the
      child's condition between yearly visits. All participants have a 1-year follow-up visit upon
      study completion.

NCT00053456,The Effect of Exercise on Stem Cell Mobilization and Heart Function in Patients Undergoing Cardiac Rehabilitation,"
      This study will look at the effect of a cardiac rehabilitation exercise program on release
      of stem cells from the bone marrow and on heart function. Stem cells are primitive cells
      produced and released by the bone marrow, circulate in the bloodstream and develop into
      white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets. Some stem cells may also develop into
      other kinds of cells, including those that make up heart muscle, especially if the heart has
      been damaged or is not getting sufficient blood. Stem cells called endothelial progenitor
      cells (EPCs) are thought to form new blood vessels that can carry blood to areas of the
      heart muscle that are oxygen-deprived because of clogged arteries. Previous experiments have
      shown that some EPCs can be forced out of the bone marrow by exercise. This study will
      examine whether repeated exercise and lifestyle changes increase the number of EPCs released
      into the bloodstream and if these cells improve heart and blood vessel function.

      Patients 21 years of age and older with coronary artery disease may be eligible for this
      study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history and physical examination,
      including a cardiovascular evaluation, and blood tests. The participants will be enrolled in
      a 2- to 3-month cardiac rehabilitation program that includes 24 to 36 60-minute sessions of
      exercise, plus instruction on lifestyle changes related to diet, stress management, and
      relaxation techniques. In addition, participants will undergo the following tests and
      procedures:

        -  Brachial reactivity study: This test measures how well the arteries widen. The patients
           rest for 30 minutes, and then an ultrasound device is placed over the artery just above
           the elbow. The device measures the size of the artery and blood flow through it before
           and after the patient is given a spray of nitroglycerin under the tongue.

        -  Blood tests for EPC levels and genetic testing: These measure EPCs and determine
           whether certain genes that may regulate EPC function are turned on or off. Genes are
           made up of DNA, the molecules that lead to the production of proteins by cells. Some of
           these proteins may be important in releasing EPCs from the bone marrow to travel in the
           bloodstream to the heart and repair blood vessels and muscle cells.

        -  Treadmill exercise testing: Patients exercise on a treadmill with continuous monitoring
           of the heartbeat and frequent measurements of oxygen saturation, using a finger clip
           device. The patient continues to exercise until moderate chest pain, shortness of
           breath, or fatigue develops.

        -  Questionnaire: Patients fill out a 15-minute questionnaire about their general physical
           and mental health status at the first and last visits to the clinic.

        -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the heart: Patients who are eligible to undergo MRI
           have this test twice during the study, once before beginning the rehabilitation program
           and again after completing the program. The MRI shows heart function and blood flow in
           the heart. For this test, the patient lies on a stretcher inside a long narrow cylinder
           (the scanner). During the scan, the drug dipyridamole, which increases blood flow to
           the heart, is infused into a vein of the hand or arm. Another drug, gadolinium, is also
           infused to brighten the images produced.

      Background:

      - Some children experience a sudden onset of symptoms similar to those found in
      obsessive-compulsive disorder that may be caused by the body s reaction to an infection with
      streptococcal bacteria, most commonly seen as strep throat or scarlet fever. When the body s
      immune system reacts against brain cells following a streptococcal infection, the condition
      is known as PANDAS (pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with
      streptococcal infections). The immune system response can be inactivated by treatment with a
      drug known as intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). Because there is insufficient research on
      IVIG s effects on the immune system of children with PANDAS, including whether IVIG is
      helpful in treating obsessive-compulsive symptoms related to PANDAS, researchers are
      interested in examining whether IVIG is an appropriate treatment for PANDAS and its
      associated symptoms.

      Objectives:

      - To test the safety and effectiveness of intravenous immunoglobulin for the treatment of
      obsessive-compulsive disorder in children with PANDAS (pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric
      disorder associated with streptococcal infection).

           information, followed by in-person screening at the National Institutes of Health
           Clinical Center.

        -  Participants will be admitted to the hospital to receive 2 days of infusions of either

NCT01440075,Prevalence and Early Markers of Atherosclerosis in Adults With a History of Kawasaki Disease,"
      Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute systemic vasculitic syndrome with coronary tropism.

      It has been reported worldwide, but it is ten times more common in Asian population. The
      annual incidence in children under 5 years in Europe is estimated at 8 to 100000. It is the
      second vasculitis of the child by its frequency after rheumatoid purpura. It occurs in 80%
      of cases between 1 and 5 years, with a maximal incidence around the age of 12 months.

      It may results in acquired heart disease in children in developed countries, and may be the
      cause of premature coronary artery disease in adulthood.

      A polymorphism was recently associated with the occurrence of disease in a Japanese and U.S
      population. (C allele of SNP itpkc_3, with a risk multiplied by 2). However, data are
      conflicting on this issue and the prevalence of this allel is unknown in North America and
      Europe populations.

      The clinical picture of KD associate a persistent fever and an antipyretics resistance with
      mucocutaneous signs and bulky cervical lymphadenopathy usually unilateral. Diagnosis is
      confirmed by the presence of five clinical signs (major criteria). The presence of
      inconsistent coronary lesions in cardiac ultrasound can confirm the diagnosis.

      KD can resolve spontaneously with no treatment. The severity of the disease is primarily
      related to complications of coronary aneurysms in acute or chronic stages.

      Several arguments support the fact that adult patients have diffuse vascular lesions
      different from aneurysmal lesions initially described in childhood.

      Despite abundance of publications on KD, there is no prospective or retrospective study
      which explored anomalies resulting from KD in adult subjects.

      Therefore, this project will describe the patient's vascular evolution, the prevalence of
      atherosclerotic lesions and to determine the biological and functional abnormalities,
      markers of accelerated atherosclerosis.

      Hypothesis : A history of Kawasaki disease represents a cardiovascular risk factor in
      adulthood.

      The main objective is to evaluate the prevalence of atherosclerotic lesions, their extent
      and their severity in adults with a history of KD in childhood compared to a control
      population.

NCT01917721,Doxycycline Treatment to Prevent Progressive Coronary Artery Dilation in Children With Kawasaki Disease,"
      Kawasaki disease (KD) affects infants and young children causing inflammation of the skin
      and blood vessels including the coronary arteries of the heart. Despite the currently
      available therapy, about one third of children develop enlargement of the coronary arteries
      that can lead to serious complications such as coronary artery stenosis, heart attack and
      even death.

      Kawasaki disease is the most common heart disease in children in the USA and it is
      especially common among the children of Hawaii. Every year, 50-90 children are diagnosed
      with KD in Hawaii and unfortunately there is no medication available to successfully prevent
      coronary artery damage in a subset of cases.

      During the first few weeks of the illness, cells of the immune system attack the coronary
      arteries and release a special substance (MMP) that is responsible for the coronary artery
      enlargement. There is a common antibiotic, doxycycline that can specifically block the
      action of this special substance (MMP). Research done on animals with KD showed that
      doxycycline was able to block this special substance and prevent enlargement of coronary
      arteries. Research in adults with enlargement of the main artery in their abdomen also
      showed that doxycycline may improve the outcome. Based on these studies doxycycline may be a
      promising therapy for children with KD, who develop enlargement of the coronary arteries.

      The investigators' proposed research study will assess the usefulness of doxycycline in
      preventing the progressive enlargement of coronary arteries in children with KD. The
      investigators plan to perform a small (pilot) study to evaluate how good is doxycycline in
      preventing coronary artery enlargement. The investigators will treat 25 children with KD and
      enlarged coronary arteries for two weeks with doxycycline and assess the change in coronary
      arteries as well as the blood levels of the special substance (MMP). If doxycycline proves
      to be beneficial in this small study, the investigators are going to design a large research
      study involving multiple institutions on Hawaii and the mainland and will recruit more
      children to be certain about the value of the proposed treatment. The investigators'
      proposal may change the treatment protocol of KD and could present a possible treatment for
      children with enlarged coronary arteries preventing potentially devastating consequences.

NCT00123734,Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Accuracy of [99mTc] ThromboView in the Detection of Deep Vein Thrombosis,"
      The assessment of patients with suspected deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a common clinical
      scenario that, despite major advances in diagnostic testing, continues to be challenging.

      The diagnosis of DVT remains problematic in:

        -  patients with suspected first DVT who have a moderate or high pre-test probability
           (PTP) for DVT and a normal compression ultrasound (CUS);

        -  patients with suspected recurrent DVT; and

        -  patients in whom CUS or contrast venography is technically difficult or not feasible
           due to patient characteristics.

      In patients with suspected first DVT who have a moderate or high PTP and a normal CUS, DVT
      occurs in up to 10% of cases. Thus, additional diagnostic testing is required, such as
      venography or serial CUS, so that DVT is not missed, but these approaches are costly and
      invasive.

      In patients with suspected recurrent DVT, currently used diagnostic approaches are
      problematic because they all have limitations in differentiating old disease from true
      recurrent disease.

      CUS is technically difficult in selected patients, particularly those who are obese.

      Contrast venography is the gold standard diagnostic test for DVT to which all other
      diagnostic venous imaging modalities for DVT are compared and judged. The Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) requires that a new diagnostic test for DVT be assessed against
      venography.

      [99mTc] ThromboView® is a novel diagnostic test based on a 99mTc-labeled monoclonal antibody
      specific for D-dimer fragments of cross-linked fibrin that are found in acute DVT. After
      intravenous injection of [99mTc] ThromboView®, there is uptake of the monoclonal antibody by
      acute, D-dimer rich, venous thrombi. This is visualized with nuclear medicine imaging as an
      area of increased radioisotope activity that corresponds to the location of DVT.

      Based on the biologic and imaging characteristics of [99mTc] ThromboView®, this diagnostic
      test has the potential to:

        -  identify small non-occlusive proximal DVT or distal DVT in patients with a moderate or
           high PTP and normal CUS;

        -  differentiate old from new DVT in patients with suspected recurrent DVT;

        -  diagnose or exclude DVT in patients in whom CUS is not technically feasible; and

        -  provide an alternative to venography that is non-invasive, has no contrast-related
           toxicity and is easily administered.

      The present study is the first phase II clinical trial of [99mTc] ThromboView® in patients
      with suspected initial or recurrent DVT in whom DVT has been confirmed or excluded by
      venography. A phase II clinical trial to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of [99mTc]
      ThromboView® is justified because:

        -  ThromboView® was well tolerated, with no significant toxicity in studies involving
           animals and healthy volunteers; and

        -  it has shown promise in Phase I trials as a non-invasive diagnostic test for acute DVT.

             -  the proportion of patients with trough anti-Xa > 0.40 IU/mL during dalteparin
                prophylaxis after 3 + 1 days, 10 + 1 days, and 17 + 1 days of dalteparin
                prophylaxis;

             -  the risk of major bleeding during the treatment period.

      The investigators' secondary research objectives are:

        -  To determine the pharmacokinetic properties of dalteparin prophylaxis in ICU patients
           with severe renal insufficiency;

        -  To identify clinical and laboratory factors that predict an excessive anticoagulant
           effect (anti-Xa > 0.10 IU/mL);

NCT00178789,Sonography Outcomes Assessment Program for Lower Extremity Deep Venous Thrombosis,"
      Currently, most emergency physicians have limited access to obtaining formal radiology
      ultrasound studies, particularly overnight. Many are forced to adopt risky and expensive
      strategies in managing their patients with suspected deep venous thrombosis (DVT) who
      present during off-hours: for low risk patients, discharging without anticoagulation and
      arranging for outpatient studies; for moderate to high risk patients, empirically
      anticoagulating and admitting to the hospital to await definitive testing. If emergency
      physicians could reliably perform an accurate ultrasound exam for DVT, such risks could be
      obviated.

      This is a prospective, observational cohort study assessing the accuracy of emergency
      physician diagnosis of proximal DVT using compact ultrasound equipment and a simplified
      compression technique. The value of color flow doppler and augmentation will also be
      assessed. Outcomes (sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio and negative
      likelihood ratio) will be assessed at 30 days.

      Prior to enrolling patients in the study, emergency physicians will undertake a 2 hour
      training course on the performance of the simplified compression technique for the diagnosis
      of lower extremity DVT. Emergency physicians will perform the DVT ultrasound exam on study

      (LMWH) use for Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) throughout the social network of general internal
      medicine interns, residents, and attendings at the University of Chicago Hospital. In

NCT00329433,Study Comparing Desirudin With Heparin to Prevent Vein Clots After Heart and Lung Surgery,"
      A blood clot in the veins, also known as deep venous thrombosis (DVT), is one of the most
      common complications after surgery. This may result in death if a clot breaks off and travel
      to the lungs; this is referred to as pulmonary embolism (PE). After heart surgery the
      incidence of DVT ranges from 20-48% and following lung surgery the incidence is 19-26%. In
      order to decrease the likelihood of this complication, patients receive by injection a blood
      thinning medicine. Heparin is the usual medicine used for this purpose following heart and
      lung surgery. Recently there have been reports that other medicines may be more effective
      than heparin for this purpose. Also there have been reports that some patients develop
      antibodies to heparin. When this occurs, this may prevent the heparin from being effective
      and may even promote the formation of blood clots. Antibodies to heparin may be present more
      often following heart and lung surgery than other types of surgery. There is a new medicine
      called desirudin (Iprivask), which may be used instead of heparin to prevent blood clots
      following heart and lung surgery. Desirudin is currently approved by the FDA to prevent
      blood clots following hip surgery. The purpose of this study is to compare desirudin with

      Rationale: a number of recent phase III randomized trials have shown a survival benefit of a
      treatment with subcutaneous low-molecular weight heparin in patients with advanced solid
      malignancies. The survival advantages observed in the studies persist for months after the
      active treatment with LMWHs. Therefore these survival advantages are thought to be due to
      effects of LMWHs on tumor cell biology.

      First line treatment of advanced NSCLC patients with the Cisplatin + Docetaxel combination
      has been widely studied, and is amongst the most active treatments currently available. The
      occurrence of grade 3/4 thrombopenia in several phase III trials was in the 0-3% range,
      making it an ideal chemotherapy regimen to combine with LMWHs in the treatment of advanced
      NSCLC.

      This trial is a prospective, single-center Phase II randomized study to demonstrate the
      superior efficacy of Fondaparinux Sodium subcutaneous injections in patients undergoing CABG
      surgery (isolated and redo isolated) versus treatment with placebo. All consecutive patients
      scheduled for CABG surgery that meet the general inclusion and none of the exclusion
      criteria will be considered for enrollment in the study.

      Consecutive patients will be randomized on the day of admission prior to their CABG surgery
      into one of two groups. One group will be randomized to the placebo while the second group
      will receive 2.5 mg Fondaparinux Sodium injections. Both groups will receive routine
      mechanical prophylaxis as determined by the treating physicians. Group randomized to receive
      Fondaparinux Sodium will receive a 2.5 mg SQ daily drug dose starting 12 +/- 2 hours
      post-wound closure or the following day in the morning (at the discretion of the

      Patients randomized will receive a 2.5 mg dose of Fondaparinux Sodium or placebo
      subcutaneously for a total of 3-9 days post CABG with day 1 being the day of surgery. The
      drug will be discontinued if the patient is discharged before day 9. If the patient stays
      for more than 9 days inside hospital, a duplex would be obtained per protocol and further
      DVT prevention measures would be instituted per the discretion of treating physician.

NCT00816920,Natural History of Isolated Deep Vein Thrombosis of the Calf,"
      Whether isolated distal DVT (IDDVT), DVT confined to the calf, should be looked for and
      diagnosed to allow them to be treated with anticoagulants remains one of the still unsolved
      issues in vascular medicine, especially because of the insufficient data on clinical risks
      of untreated distal DVT. Management studies have shown that it is safe to withhold
      anticoagulation in outpatients with suspected DVT if compression ultrasonography (CUS)
      limited to the proximal deep veins yields normal results on presentation and on repeated
      examination after 5 to 7 days. This strategy is based on the premise that IDDVT do not need
      to be diagnosed and treated, what is necessary when they extend involving the proximal
      veins. There is no general agreement, however, on the assumption that the non-extending
      IDDVT do not need to be diagnosed and treated, and many authors recommend to perform a
      single CUS examination extended to the distal deep veins. All the available studies have
      treated with anticoagulants the diagnosed IDDVT and no adequate information is available on
      the risk of IDDVT left untreated.

      The present study, performed in outpatients with suspected leg DVT, aims at assessing the
      clinical consequences of IDDVT diagnosed (by a complete US investigation) but not treated
      because the results of this investigation remain blind to both the patient and the treating
      doctor, whereas the diagnostic-therapeutic procedure remains the usual one, based on CUS
      investigation limited to diagnose proximal DVT, to be repeated after 5-7 days (or earlier)

NCT01164046,Long-term Treatment for Cancer Patients With Deep Venous Thrombosis or Pulmonary Embolism,"
      Background

      Patients with cancer and a first deep venous thrombosis of the leg or pulmonary embolism
      (venous thromboembolism, VTE) are generally treated with low molecular weight heparin
      (LMWH)injections for 6 months, since this treatment is associated with a reduced incidence
      of recurrent VTE compared to vitamin K antagonists (VKA). It is recommended that patients
      with active malignancy (metastatic cancer and/or ongoing cancer treatment)continue
      anticoagulant treatment. However, it is unknown whether LMWH is still superior compared to
      VKA for the long-term anticoagulant treatment.

      Aim

      The aim of this study is to evaluate whether low-molecular-weight heparin more effectively
      reduces recurrent VTE compared to vitamin K antagonists in patients with cancer who have
      already completed 6 to 12 months of anticoagulant treatment because of deep venous
      thrombosis of the leg or pulmonary embolism.

      Hypothesis

      The investigators hypothesize that LMWH is more effective compared to VKA in the long-term
      treatment of VTE in cancer patients who have already been treated for 6-12 months with
      anticoagulants.

      Design

      This is a multicenter, multinational, randomized, open label trial.

      Patients

      Patients with a malignancy (all types, solid and hematological) who have received 6-12
      months of anticoagulation for VTE and have an indication for continuing anticoagulation,
      will be randomly assigned to six additional months of LMWH or VKA. LMWH will be administered
      in a weight-adjusted scheme, with 65-75% of therapeutic doses. All types of LMWH and VKA are
      allowed, as long as weight adjusted dosing is possible for LMWH. The target INR will be
      2.0-3.0. The primary efficacy outcome is symptomatic recurrent VTE, i.e. deep vein
      thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. The primary safety outcome is major bleeding.

      Sample size

      A total of 65 to 87 recurrent VTE events are needed to show a 50% reduction with LMWH as
      compared to VKA (type I error 0.05, two-sided, power respectively 80 and 90%). To observe 75
      events, with a 10% event rate per half year in the VKA arm and 5% in the LMWH arm a total of
      1000 patients will need to be included.

      Organisation

      Outcomes will be adjudicated by a central adjudication committee. A steering committee will
      be formed, preferably consisting of one member of every participating center. An electronic
      case report form will be used for data collection. Also, an electronic trial master file

NCT01298986,Atrial Fibrillation Ablation The Hybrid Approach Versus Traditional Management,"
      Rationale: To determine the most beneficial ablation methodology for individual patients
      with paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation (defined by the Heart Rhythm Society) as
      surgeons and electrophysiologists work together on a convergent procedure (hybrid) to place
      the epicardial and endocardial ablation lines.

      Objectives: Catheter and surgical ablation are being offered today to patients with drug
      refractory and symptomatic atrial fibrillation. This study is designed to assess the most
      efficient ablation approach in patients with paroxysmal and persistent atrial fibrillation.
      In patients with left atrium size of less than 5.0 cm, a Hybrid approach (pulmonary vein
      isolation performed surgically will be combined with right and left atrial flutter lines
      performed using a transcatheter approach) will be compared to percutaneous catheter ablation
      to isolate the pulmonary veins and apply the left and right atrial flutter lines with
      removal of LA appendage. In the group of patients with left atrial size 5.0-6.0 cm the
      Hybrid approach is going to be compared to the minimally invasive Cox-Maze III procedure.

      Our hypotheses with regard to the rate of return to sinus rhythm off antiarrhythmic drugs at
      6 months will demonstrate that the Hybrid approach is going to be a: superior to
      percutaneous catheter ablation in the less than 5 cm left atrial group and b: non-inferior
      when compared to the Cox-Maze III procedure in the 5-6 cm left atrial cm group.

      We hypothesize that the safety of all procedures will show no differences and that there
      will be no differences in clinical complications between groups.

      At two weeks post surgery, the IPC intervention will be ended and both patient groups will
      be immobilized in an orthosis until follow-up at six weeks.

      The endpoint of the first part of the study is VTE events. The primary outcome will be the
      DVT-incidence at two weeks, assessed using screening compression duplex ultrasound (CDU) by
      two ultrasonographers masked to the treatment allocation. Secondary outcome will be the
      DVT-incidence at 6 weeks.

      in pregnant women just before birth, at the period of maximal physiological hypercoagulable
      state and with high risk of thromboembolism, the most common cause of maternal mortality in
      developed countries. Although LMWH are now routinely administered as prevention of
      thromboembolism, their effect on coagulation in pregnant women was not yet studied. The
      doses of LMWH in pregnancy are only derived in terms of coagulation from totally different
      groups of patients (surgical, orthopedic). We therefore will map the effect of
      thromboprophylactic LMWH dose on coagulation in pregnant women using recently available
      methods, especially a complex examination of coagulation within 24 h after LMWH application
      using thrombelastography, including examination with heparinase, and monitoring the effect
      of LMWH by measuring antiXa and TGT (thrombin generation time) activity. Based on these
      results we will also evaluate the possible influence of LMWH prophylaxis on the risk of
      spinal haematoma during neuraxial analgesia/anesthesia for delivery/Caesarean section. On
      the basis of our pilot results we can presume the current dosage of LMWH in pregnant women
      is inadequate and that it would be appropriate to adjust presently used dosage. At the same
      time we want to prove that the standard LMWH thromboprophylaxis in pregnant women does not
      increase the risk of spinal haematoma during neuraxial blockade. In both situations the
      targeted outcome is to increase the safety of pregnant women.

      Pulmonary embolism is a complex disease, with a highly variable clincal presentation.
      Diagnosis starts with clinical probability assessment mainly based on medical history and
      rapidly available clinical data. Pulmonary embolism can be managed by emergency department,
      cardiology, pneumology geriatrics or internal medicine physicians. Thus, initial clinical
      management can varies based on the attitude of the attending physician.

      Diagnosis is a crucial point as it can influence short term mortality.

NCT01708239,"Left Rule, D-Dimer Measurement and Complete Ultrasonography to Rule Out Deep Vein Thrombosis During Pregnancy.","
      In pregnant women with suspected DVT, a sure diagnosis is mandatory. In non-pregnant
      patients, sequential diagnostic strategies based on 1) the assessment of clinical
      probability, 2) D-dimer measurement and 3) compression ultrasonography (CUS) have been well
      validated.

      Clinical probability assessment by clinical prediction rules (CPRs) is a crucial step in the
      management of suspected DVT. However, the most commonly used CPR for DVT, the Wells' score,
      has never been validated in pregnant women. Recently, the 'LEFt' clinical prediction rule
      was derived and internally validated. A prospective validation of this rule is now
      warranted, and we plan to use it in our prospective study.

      The second step used in the diagnostic strategy including non-pregnant patients is D-dimer
      measurement. The test has been widely validated in non-pregnant patients and, in association
      with a non-high clinical probability, it allows to safely rule out DVT.

      As D-dimer level raise steadily during pregnancy, the specificity of the test decreases and
      it is less useful in pregnant women. Data from the literature clearly suggest that the usual
      cut-off set a 500 ng/ml would safely rule out DVT in pregnant women [6]. As the usual
      cut-off has never been prospectively validated in pregnant women with suspected DVT, we
      would like to use it in our study.

      Some studies suggested that complete CUS is safe to rule out DVT in pregnant women. However,
      this test is not always available. Therefore, a strategy in which the association of
      clinical probability assessment and D-dimer measurement would allow to safely rule out DVT
      in a significant proportion of patients without performing a complete CUS, would be of great
      help in everyday clinical practice and would probably be cost-effective.

      Therefore, we plan a prospective study to assess the safety of a sequential diagnostic
      strategy based on the assessment of clinical probability with the LEFt rule, D-dimer
      measurement and complete CUS in pregnant women with suspected DVT.

      Medical reasoning is a form of inquiry that examines the thought processes involved in
      making medical decisions. When physicians are faced with patients' symptoms or signs, their
      thought processes follow either direct shortcuts to suspect a diagnosis or go into a deeper
      and more analytic process to reach a diagnosis. The second pathway is less prone to biases
      and errors. This study explores whether the use of an interactive visual display of

      to form blood clots, and hormonal changes. Data suggest that these factors help cause venous
      insufficiency (when the veins do not adequately return blood from the extremities to the
      torso). As venous insufficiency progresses, complications follow, the most severe of which
      include superficial thrombophlebitis and deep venous thrombosis (DVT, or blood clots).
      Although the fear of DVT has been well publicized, its prevention and prevalence in pregnant
      women has not been well-studied.

      The exact cause of venous insufficiency is not known. However, known risk factors include
      being female and hormonal changes associated with oral contraceptive use, certain hormone
      replacement medications, and pregnancy. Being pregnant places the mother at additional risk
      for developing venous insufficiency.

      Compression stockings are used to manage the condition, but this is by no means standard of
      care despite their easy use and safety. The medical community's understanding of how
      compression stockings work is largely theoretical; however, it is believed that the
      compression works by preventing venous hypertension in the lower legs, thereby preventing
      venous insufficiency and its associated complications.

      Research hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that compression stocking use will be
      associated with lower incidence of varicose veins and, in those patients who already have
      varicose veins, lower incidence of complications associated with venous insufficiency.
      Further, the investigators believe that compression stocking use will be associated with a
      lower incidence or lessening of symptoms associated with venous insufficiency.

      Importance: An undetected DVT can be fatal. Even if detected promptly, DVT is associated
      with long term health problems. Treatment of a DVT requires anticoagulation which can be
      risky to both mother and fetus. The prevention or reduction of DVT in pregnant women through
      use of compression stockings would revolutionize their care. Further, this intervention is
      safe and noninvasive.

      The investigators propose to conduct a randomized, pilot study comparing pregnant women
      without and with varicose veins randomized to wear compression stockings to a similar group
      of participants randomized to no compression stocking use.

NCT01849406,Effect of Nasal Steroids in Snoring Intensity,"
      It is anecdotally well known that patients snore more when their nose is blocked. However,
      the therapeutic effect of improving nasal airway patency on snoring indices remains a point
      of conjecture. Indeed, Braver et al examined the effect of a nasal vasoconstrictor and
      failed to show any improvement in the number of snores after its application, although
      apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI)seemed to decrease. Furthermore, Hoffstein et al documented that
      dilation of the anterior nares in patients without nasal pathology has a relatively weak
      effect on snoring, and routine use of nasal dilating appliances was not recommended for the
      treatment of snoring. In contrast to the aforementioned studies, intranasal corticosteroids
      have been shown to improve sleepiness and reduce AHI in patients with obstructive sleep
      apnea (OSA) implying that there might be an equivalent result for the use of nasal steroids
      on snoring indices.

      Additionally, the present authors have demonstrated a strong correlation between
      apnoea-hypopnoea index and oral/oro-nasal breathing epochs in patients with OSA and normal
      nasal resistance and that nasal surgery is effective only in OSA patients who preoperatively
      have decreased nasal breathing epochs.

      It is plausible thus to suggest that snoring severity, in equivalence to OSA severity, might
      be associated to oral/oro-nasal breathing epochs and that improving nasal patency by nasal
      steroids might also increase nasal breathing epochs and lead to decreased snoring indices in
      patients who had decreased nasal breathing before the administration of nasal steroids.

      Patients will be randomized in two groups: the patients of the first group will undergo a
      one week therapy of nasal budesonide, then two weeks of washout period, and thereafter one
      week of nasal normal saline. The patients of the second group will undergo a one week
      therapy of nasal normal saline, then two weeks of washout period, and thereafter one week of
      nasal budesonide. Before and after each treatment regimen patients will undergo an
      assessment, which will consist of anterior rhinomanometry and polysomnography with
      concomitant measurement of snoring indices and breathing route pattern.

      The investigators hypothesize that the application for one week of nasal budesonide has a
      beneficial effect on snoring indices in patients who present before the application
      decreased proportion of nasal breathing epochs and in whom nasal budesonide succeeded in
      increasing nasal breathing epochs.

NCT01856842,Reperfusion of Pulmonary Arteriovenous Malformations After Embolotherapy,"
      AVMs are abnormal collections of blood vessels which can occur in any part of the body
      including the lungs. These blood vessels are weakened and can rupture anytime causing
      bleeding which can be massive, leading to life-threatening conditions.

      Pulmonary AVMs occur in about 40% of patients with HHT. Each patient may have an average of
      5 AVMs .Rupture of the AVM can lead to massive bleeding in the lung, stroke and infection of
      the brain. In order to prevent these complications, patients with HHT are routinely examined
      for pulmonary AVMs and treatment with embolization is recommended.

      AVMs have a main blood vessel or artery supplying blood to the collection of blood vessels.
      The way to treat AVMs is cut off their blood supply through a process called embolization.

      Embolization is a standard medical procedure which is done to stop or prevent hemorrhage
      (bleeding) from an AVM. It involves blocking the artery that supplies blood to the AVM by
      inserting a foreign body, into the blood vessel supplying blood to the AVM.

      Standard devices used for embolization include coils (made of stainless steel or platinum).
      These devices usually have a good success rate for blocking the artery that supplies blood
      to the AVM. However, a few AVMs that are embolized by standard devices may reopen over time.
      This is called reperfusion and will require repeat embolization procedures.

      For embolization of pulmonary AVMs at St. Michael's Hospital, the Nester coil is used. In
      this study, we would like to compare the Nester coil with a new coil device called the
      Interlock Fibered IDC Occlusion System. Both coils are approved for use in Canada, however
      the cost of the IDC coil limits its use at this hospital.

      Compared to the Nester coil, the IDC coils are made so that they can be removed or
      repositioned if they are not placed correctly. The coil also allows tighter packing which
      helps prevent reperfusion.

      This study will compare the success rate of embolization between the Interlock™ Fibered IDC™
      Occlusion System (IDC coil) and the Nester coil.

NCT01956955,Comparison of Low-Molecular-Weight Heparin (LMWH) and Unfractionated Heparin (UFH) in Combination With Thrombolytic Treatment of Acute Massive Pulmonary Thromboembolism,"
      Purpose and rationale: Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common and often fatal disease,
      with an approximately 30% mortality rate without treatment. Treatment is important to reduce
      mortality and recurrence in acute PE. Therapeutic options for PE include subcutaneous low
      molecular weight heparin (SC LMWH), intravenous unfractionated heparin (IV UFH),
      subcutaneous unfractionated heparin and subcutaneous fondaparinux with or without
      thrombolysis. In the treatment of acute PE, SC LMWH has been shown, at least, as effective
      and safe as IV UFH [4]. Compared to IV UFH, SC LMWH associated with lower mortality, fewer
      recurrent thrombotic events and less major bleeding. Current guidelines recommend use of SC
      LMWH for most hemodynamically stable patients with PE and they say that SC LMWH have not
      been tested in the setting of acute massive PE.

      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that SC LMWH is as safe as IV UFH in the
      treatment of acute PE in combination with thrombolytic treatment.

NCT01970202,Anti Xa Levels Under Two Different Regimens of Enoxaparin VTE Prophylaxis After Sleeve Gastrectomy for Morbid Obesity,"
      Approximately two thirds of the adult population in developed countries is categorized as
      over-weight or obese (BMI>30). In spite of worldwide increasing awareness, obesity is a
      major health concern. In the presence of numerous diets, medical therapies, and robust
      research, bariatric surgery remains the most effective means of weight reduction in morbidly
      obese patients (BMI>40, or BMI>35 with co-morbidities). However, bariatric surgery harbors a
      relatively high risk for postoperative complications; of them, venous thromboembolic events
      (VTE) are not common, but potentially lethal. Taken together with the propensity of morbidly
      obese patients to develop VTE, perioperative thromboprophylaxis is mandatory.

      To date, low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) are most commonly used for VTE prophylaxis in
      the aforementioned population. Due to the pharmacologic properties of LMWH and the
      characteristics of surgically treated obese patients, the optimal dose that is to be
      utilized for VTE prophylaxis in this population remains unclear. Assessment of anti-FXa
      levels in the patients' plasma can be used in order to monitor LMWH activity. Levels of
      0.2-0.5 U/ml have been proposed by some authors for VTE prophylaxis.

      Few studies have compared different dosing regimens of enoxaparin (between 30mg-60mg q/12h)
      for VTE prophylaxis in the population undergoing bariatric surgery; nevertheless, these were
      small non- randomized trials, containing numerous methodological weaknesses. Hence, the
      optimal regimen of enoxaparin to be used for the prevention of VTE in the discussed
      population remains unclear.

      The aim of the present study is to evaluate plasma levels of anti-FXa activity, comparing
      two most commonly used enoxaparin prophylactic regimens (40mg vs 60mg q/24h) in a large and
      homogenous cohort of sleeve gastrectomy patients. Although universally used by bariatric
      surgeons, the pharmacologic efficacy of these regimens has not been evaluated in patients

      Our Center for Bariatric Surgery is interested in conducting a pharmacokinetic study of

      in the obese adult population to determine if bariatric surgery influences apixaban
      exposure. More interesting would be to see how the dose may need to change pre- vs.
      post-bariatric surgery (this will be important for physicians as more and more patients
      undergo this procedure worldwide and many may require anticoagulation in their future
      healthcare).

      Physicians and surgeons are very interested in oral anticoagulants for this special patient
      population. To date, there is no approved dosing for the obese patient (especially when
      considering surgical intervention such as bariatric surgery).

NCT00004572,Identification and Therapy Efficacy of Type 2 Diabetes in Hispanic Patients,"
      The two major types of diabetes are type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Although most patients with
      type 2 diabetes are older than age 40, type 2 diabetes has been reported with increasing
      frequency among patients under the age of 20. This form of diabetes has been called type 2
      diabetes of youth, abbreviated type 2Y. Little is known about the etiology of type 2Y;
      however, clinicians believe that it occurs most commonly in obese children of particular
      ethnic groups. A positive family history appears to be one major risk factor for developing
      type 2Y diabetes. The individual contribution of ethnicity, obesity, and genetics to type 2Y
      have yet to be elucidated. There is no consensus regarding treatment with type 2Y diabetes.
      Observation of our Hispanic patients in the Houston area reveals a large number with type
      2Y. The major purpose of this study is to examine the genetic and environmental risk factors
      such as family history, ethnicity, and obesity in Hispanic children with type 2Y diabetes.

      associated with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes of youth. 2) To compare the efficacy of
      the treatment modalities, insulin and oral agents, in type 2Y patients. METHODS: We will
      undertake a retrospective case study, to include a review of hypothesized risk factors in
      all the medical records of pediatric diabetes patients seen at University of Texas. We
      anticipate that approximately 200 patients with type 1 diabetes and 30 patients with type 2Y
      diabetes will be identified. A Sustacal challenge test will be done in patients with a
      suspected diagnosis of type 2Y in order to confirm the clinical diagnosis. Parents will be
      contacted by phone for a detailed pedigree intake. Type 1 and type 2Y patients will be
      compared for each of the studied features. A retrospective review of diabetes type 2
      therapies used in type 2Y patients will be undertaken through further examination of the
      medical records in order to compare insulin treatment to oral agents. We will also test a

      SACCHACHITIN gel, prepared from the waste residue of the fruiting body of Ganoderma tsugae,

      vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as well as on the healing of skin wounds in humans
      are estimated by a clinical trial.

      The hypothesis regarding the poor healing of the wound is the over-expression of MMP and the
      inhibition of the angiogenic factors. From the previous animal study, the effect of
      SACCHACHITIN was to inhibit the activity of MMP and stimulation of VEGF and we try to prove
      the effect over the human wounds from this clinical trial.

      Patients with a poorly healed wound, in which skin graft is clinically indicated, are
      included in this study. The exudates from the wound are collected and analyzed for the
      activity and concentration of VEGF and MMP. The change of the healing process is recorded.

      Positive results are expected from the clinical trial and the patients will get another

NCT00355602,Antibiotics for the Treatment of Ulcerative Colitis,"
      Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an acute and chronic inflammatory bowel disease, whose cause is
      unknown. However, it is widely accepted that bacteria living in the large bowel are
      essential for the development of the disease. Intuitively, therefore, a logical approach to
      treatment would be to use antibiotics. However, antimicrobial chemotherapy has been
      unsuccessful in managing acute colitis, and has had only limited benefit in long-term
      treatment. The failure of antibiotics in UC arises from the fact that no-one has tried to
      identify which bacteria are involved in causing disease, and equally importantly, nobody has
      targeted appropriate antibiotics to knock out the specific bacteria in question, in a
      systematic way. Despite this, increasing evidence implicates bacteria living on the lining
      of the bowel being involved in UC. Our aim, therefore is to identify bacteria colonizing the
      mucosal surface in the lower large intestine and to determine the antibiotic sensitivities
      of those the investigators believe to be particularly involved in the disease, such as
      enterococcit, peptostreptococci and enterobacteria. Because the investigators have already
      studied resistance to antimicrobial in many mucosal isolate, the investigators plan ot focus
      on using a combination of two antibiotics in this work. A controlled trial will test the
      benefit of using these antibiotics over a period of one month and then the patients will be
      followed up over a six month period. The investigators will be looking for significant
      long-term improvements, and a reduction in drug use following antibiotic therapy.

NCT00358059,Behavior Therapy for Families of Diabetic Adolescents,"
      Effective adaptation to type 1 diabetes mellitus requires adolescents and their families to
      work together effectively to solve problems and resolve disagreements in order to achieve
      acceptable diabetic control and treatment adherence. Many studies show that problematic
      family communication, insufficient parental involvement in care and parent-adolescent
      conflict are associated with poor adherence and poor diabetic control. This study tests a
      family communication and problem solving intervention by randomizing families of adolescent
      with type 1 diabetes to 6 months' treatment either with the experimental intervention,
      continuation in standard medical care for diabetes, or participation in a multifamily
      educational support group. Families are then followed for an additional 12 months to examine
      the longer-term effects of the interventions on the targeted diabetes outcomes.

NCT00999635,A Comparison of Insoles Used to Prevent Neuropathic Diabetic Foot Ulceration,"
      Importance of the topic:

      Lower extremity amputation is a costly complication of diabetes for both the NHS and the
      patient. Amputation may be avoided if the preceding foot ulceration can be prevented. One
      method of reducing the risk of ulceration in the neuropathic foot is through the provision
      of therapeutic insoles. The type of insole prescribed (prefabricated verses custom made) is
      currently based on anecdotal evidence. The idea held by many practitioners that the custom
      made insole is superior in its effect remains speculation, unsupported by the evidence. In
      the absence of economic analysis, the available data suggests that the custom insole is
      substantially more expensive to the NHS. This study, to determine which of two types of
      insole used in therapeutic shoes reduces peak pressure more in the at−risk diabetic foot, is
      therefore a very important topic and will provide both useful evidence for the NHS podiatry
      services. It is of course also very important for patients with diabetes as the personal
      suffering of those undergoing amputation is immense.

      The study is a single blind randomised controlled trial comparing custom made with 'off the

      Background:

      This is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of two novel behavioral interventions to enhance
      treatment adherence and improve low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) in diabetes. Among
      adults with diabetes, high LDL greatly increases their risk for cardiovascular disease
      (CVD). Despite the proven efficacy of LDL control(<100 mg/dL) in preventing CVD, the control
      rate is low. Poor adherence to treatment(diet, exercise and medication) is the main reason
      for this poor control.

      Aims: This study will test two telephone-delivered interventions, a Transtheoretical
      stage-matched intervention (SMI) and a Prospect theory-based framing effects intervention
      (FEI). The investigators hypothesize that both SMI and FEI will be more effective in
      improving LDL control than an attention placebo intervention (API) at 6 months. SMI and FEI
      will also be more effective in increasing adherence to medications, diet and exercise than
      API at 6 months.

      Methods:

      The investigators will recruit 246 adults with diabetes and high LDL despite being on
      medications. Key outcomes are adherence to diet, exercise and medication, and LDL control.
      The interventions will be standardized and fidelity of intervention maintained. Using a
      blinded RCT the investigators will test the effect of SMI and FEI compared to API on LDL
      control and adherence. All analyses will be intent to treat.

      Significance:

      This project will provide important information to improve diabetes-related behavior and
      lead to the implementation of novel interventions for lowering LDL in primary care settings
      among adults with diabetes. It may also provide the scientific rationale to use such
      approaches to control other risk factors in diabetes.

      and / or type 2, compared to subjects without diabetes are at risk for osteopenia and / or
      abnormal bone structure the foot (calcaneus and ankle) can lead to bone deformities,
      fractures and final stage of Charcot foot. These anomalies are favored by the presence of
      peripheral neuropathy and plasma levels of advanced glycation end products higher than in
      diabetic subjects without bone abnormalities.

      The objectives of this research are to evaluate these anomalies quantitative and qualitative
      bone in the foot (calcaneus and ankle) through the use of MicroScanner. In parallel a whole
      body bone mineral density (BMD) and calcaneal ultrasound will be performed to measure bone
      mineral density as realized in clinical practice in a defined population of patients with
      type 1 or type 2. These bone abnormalities will be correlated with the presence of
      peripheral neuropathy and the rate of advanced glycation end products of proteins and
      reference to parameters of chronic inflammation and oxidative stress to better understand
      the pathophysiology and target a population at risk.

      The importance of this study is paramount in the management of diabetic foot. Indeed for the

NCT01370837,Neurogenic Inflammation in Diabetes,"
      Polyneuropathy is a complication of diabetes mellitus which leads to decreased sensation in
      arms and legs. This in turn can lead to the development of (infected) foot ulcers. Charcot's
      disease can also be a consequence of polyneuropathy. Patients with Charcot's disease
      suddenly develop a red, warm and swollen foot, like an infection. Charcot's disease leads to
      foot fractures. After these fractures have healed, the shape of the foot can be dramatically
      altered. This altered shape of the foot increases the risk of developing foot ulcers. Nerves
      are important in regulating the inflammatory response. This study aims to investigate
      whether the inflammatory response is different in patients with polyneuropathy with and
      without a history of Charcot's disease.

NCT01432925,Timing of Surgical Intervention in Buruli Ulcer Patients Treated With Antibiotics,"
      SUMMARY

      Rationale: Buruli ulcer, caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans, is an ulcerative disease endemic
      in West Africa. It often leads to functional limitations. Treatment was by extensive
      surgery, until in 2005 gradually antibiotic treatment for eight weeks with rifampicin and
      streptomycin was added. Observation of Buruli ulcer lesions of limited size during
      antibiotic treatment showed that during treatment there is a paradoxical increase of the
      lesion, with a decrease of the lesion after week 14. Current WHO protocols advise to decide
      whether surgery is needed four weeks after the start of antibiotics. This might be too early
      in the healing process. The investigators hypothesize that delay in surgery is safe, and
      that it results in a reduction of the number of surgical interventions.

      Objectives:

      Primary Objective of this study is to compare the need for surgical treatment in standard
      timing of surgery at the end of eight weeks antimicrobial treatment with a policy to
      postpone surgical treatment until week 14.

      Secondary Objectives are to study whether postponing surgery leads to less extensive surgery
      and a change in frequency of functional limitations;

      Study design:

      Patients will be randomized for surgery at week 8 after start of antibiotic treatment and
      week 14 after start of treatment. Reasons for treating doctors to decide to intervene with
      surgery will be according to current clinical practice and will be clearly defined in this
      protocol. Standard care of eight weeks of rifampicin and streptomycin will be given. All
      patients will be followed and lesional size using acetate sheet recordings will be used
      during follow-up.

      Study population: Patients with a clinical picture of Buruli ulcer disease confirmed by
      diagnostic tests in the districts covered by the Buruli ulcer centers in Lalo and Allada,
      Benin. Patients who are pregnant, have a contraindication for general anaesthesia and
      children below three years old will be excluded. 130 Patients in each treatment arm will be
      included to detect a difference in percentage of patients needing surgery of 20 percent.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: Primary outcome measure is the number of patients healed
      without surgery. Secondary outcome measures are the extent of surgery by measurement of
      lesional size, functional limitations after the end of treatment and one year after the
      start of treatment and the duration of admission.

NCT01477047,Identification of Risk Factors of Prolonged Wound Healing Following Primary Arthroplasty,"
      Prolonged wound drainage following total joint replacement surgery has been shown to be a
      predictor of postoperative infection. Several factors have been associated with delayed
      wound healing and increased risk of infection. Namely hypertension, obesity, diabetes,
      smoking and autoimmune disease have been shown to have a detrimental effect on wound
      healing. The purpose of this study is to verify those findings and determine additional
      pharmacological, surgical and patient related factors that may result in prolonged wound
      drainage, prolonged hospital stay and increased risk of infection

NCT01480414,Side Effects of 4 Times Bone Marrow Mono Nuclear Transplantation in Patients With Ischemic Lower Limb,"
      Critical limb ischemia (CLI) results from severe occlusive disease that impairs distal limb
      perfusion to the point where oxygen delivery is no longer adequate to meet the metabolic
      needs of the tissue, even under resting conditions. The limits of peripheral artery disease
      (PAD) compensatory mechanisms, such as distal vasodilatation and collateral formation, have
      been exceeded at this point. PAD is a widespread disease, affecting up to 15% of all adults
      older than 55 years. Formation of true new blood vessels, or angiogenesis, and development
      of collateral vessels from preexisting blood vessels, or arteriogenesis, is important in the
      pathophysiology of vascular disease. By stimulating these processes the investigators might
      be able to provide an alternative treatment strategy for patients with lower limb ischemia.
      In response to tissue injury and remodeling, neovascularization usually occurs via the
      proliferation and migration of progenitor endothelial cells (EPC) from preexisting
      vasculature. Indeed, recent studies have shown that bone-marrow mononuclear cell (BM-MNC)
      implantation increases collateral vessel formation in patients with limb ischemia. So the
      investigators determine to evaluate the efficacy of repeated MNC transplantation in patients
      with ischemic lower limb.

NCT01666093,Non-Healing Ulcers Without Critical Limb Ischemia,"
      Background: Lower limb arterial revascularization procedures, either percutaneously or
      surgically performed, are an established treatment modality of ischemic foot ulcers,
      especially in the setting of a critical limb ischemia. Many other lower limb ulcers are
      secondary to a combined disease, which may include a concomitant venous disease (chronic
      venous insufficiency or varicous disease) or a micro-angiopathic disease (i.e. small vessel
      disease). In this setting, and especially in the absence of a concomitant severe
      macro-angiopathic disease, the safety and efficacy of a percutaneous lower limb
      revascularization have so far never been evaluated in a prospective study.

      Aim: This study is aimed to evaluate the safety and the efficacy of an endovascular
      revascularization approach of the lower limb, in all consecutive patients presenting with a
      non-healing ulcer associated with a mild to moderate peripheral artery disease (i.e.
      mixed-origin ulcers).

      Material and methods: This prospective study will consecutively include all patients
      presenting with a non-healing ulcer. Included patients must have all the concomitant ulcer
      co-factors being adequately treated for at least 6 months. Accordingly, an underlying venous
      disease, infectious disease or inflammatory disorder must be previously evaluated and
      adequately treated (i.e. compression stocking, varices stripping, antibiotics, local ±
      systemic anti-inflammatory, etc.). Furthermore, a non-invasive arterial evaluation must be
      obtained in all patients. The arterial screening must included an ankle-brachial index (ABI)
      and toe pressure (TP) measurements, a trans-cutaneous oxygen measurement (tcPO2) at the foot
      and calf levels and a non-invasive arterial mapping (i.e. angio-CT or angio-MRI). This
      arterial work-up must be compatible with the presence of a mild to moderate peripheral
      artery disease without any sign or criteria suggesting the presence of a critical limb
      ischemia.

      End-points: The success rate of perform an endovascular revascularization intervention in
      all consecutive patients which qualify according to the inclusion criteria (technical
      feasibility). Establish the proportion of procedural related complications (safety). Analyze
      the clinical and the para-clinical improvements in term of heal of the ulcers, as well as
      the improvement of the ABI, TP, tcPO2 at 1 week, 1-3-6 months after the procedure
      (efficacy).

      Sample size: The investigators plan to include ≈ 30 patients in two years. After 1 year of
      enrollment the investigators will perform an interim analysis and will decide at that
      moment, according to the observed end-points, if prolonging the study would be of any
      scientific value or if the study has to be interrupt earlier because of a significant

      Chronic venous ulceration of the lower limb poses a significant problem to patients and

      South Asians (SA) living in Canada and globally have high rates of type 2 diabetes
      (diabetes). Despite the burden of diabetes in this population, diabetes management remains
      poor. SA patients are less likely to exercise, follow a healthy diet (4), participate in
      exercise programs (5), and are 24% less likely to achieve glucose, blood pressure and lipid
      targets for diabetes than the general population (6). 55-60% of SA patients were
      non-adherent to their diabetes life-saving medications, compared to 30-35% non-adherence in
      the general population (7). This large gap in diabetes care is not surprising given language
      and communication barriers between primary care providers and SA patients (8-10), lack of
      knowledge about diabetes (8-11), preference for alternative therapies (12-14) and
      fundamentally different cultural beliefs on diabetes and diabetes management (15-18).
      Although there is some preliminary evidence that culturally tailored, chronic disease models
      may improve outcomes (21-24), the current evidence base is insufficient to justify the
      system modifications required to provide culturally tailored care across primary care

      apply moisturizer containing his own antimicrobial bacteria to one of his arms for a total
      of 6 times at a frequency determined by the half-life, which will be computed at the end of
      the first part of this experiment. The subject will return prior to the 7th application time
      point for skin swabs of the arm to ensure that there are still viable bacteria from the
      moisturizer present on the arm. In the third part of the study, each subject will receive
      both moisturizer as well as moisturizer plus his own antimicrobial bacteria. The subject
      will apply the moisturizer to one arm and the moisturizer plus bacteria to the other arm
      daily for a total of 15 days. Subjects will return to the clinic every 5 days for skin swabs
      and clinical evaluations. If the moisturizer containing bacteria is able to decrease the S.
      aureus colonization on subject's arms, the study team hypothesizes that subjects will have
      improvement of their AD symptoms.

NCT02169167,Comparison of Resin Salve and Octenidine in Patients With Neuropathic Diabetic Foot Ulcers,"
      Prevalence of diabetic foot ulcers are reported to be 15% in patients who suffer from
      diabetes and ulcerations are present in 84% of all diabetes-related amputations. Peripheral
      neuropathy leading to unperceived trauma seems to be the major cause of diabetic foot ulcers
      with 45-60% of ulcers to be considered merely neuropathic and 45% of mixed, neuropathic and
      ischemic etiology. Ulceration of lower limb is one of the most common complications related
      with diabetes and one of the major causes for hospitalization of diabetic patients. The most
      significant contributors to diabetic lower limb ulceration are neuropathy, deformity,
      uncontrolled elevated plantar pressure, poor glycemic status, peripheral vascular disease,
      male gender and duration of diabetes. Treatment of lower limb ulcers imposes an enormous
      burden on health care resources worldwide, and at least 33% of all expenses are spent to
      treat diabetic ulcers manifested as a complication of diabetes.

      Although at least 170 topical wound care products are available, evidence of the superiority
      of one over another is tenuous, well-designed randomized, controlled trials are rare, and
      the number of case-control or observational studies is limited. In recent years, salve
      prepared from Norway spruce (Picea abies) resin has successfully been used in medical
      context to treat both acute and chronic wounds and ulcers of various origins. The objective
      of this prospective, randomized and controlled clinical trial is to investigate healing rate
      and healing time of neuropathic diabetic foot ulcer in patients, who are suffering from
      infected fore- or mid-foot ulceration (PEDIS-classification ≥ Grade II; 19) originated from
      Type I or II diabetes, and in patients whose diabetic ulcerations are candidates for topical
      treatment with resin (Study treatment) or octenidine (Control treatment). In addition,
      factors contributing with delayed healing of ulceration, antimicrobial properties, safety
      and cost-effectiveness of the resin salve treatment and control treatment will be analyzed.

NCT02222376,Effect of Topic Pirfenidone in Diabetic Ulcers,"
      Pirfenidone is a synthetic molecule, which acts as a potent modulator of the effect of
      various cytokines (TNF-α, transforming growth factor-β, platelet derived growth factor and
      vascular endothelial growth factor, among others) that possesses anti-inflammatory and
      anti-fibrinolytic properties.

      The aim of this study is to compare the effect of topic treatment with pirfenidone compared
      to conventional treatment in chronic diabetic foot ulcers.

      The hypothesis is that treatment with topic pirfenidone in chronic diabetic foot ulcers
      (Wagner 1 to 2) reduces the ulcer size and shortens the healing time compared to
      conventional treatment. This is a randomized, controlled and crossover study. Patients will
      be randomly assigned to conventional treatment or topic pirfenidone for eight weeks. At the
      end of this period they will change groups. Each week ulcers will be for size, depth, length
      and evidence of infection. The ulcers will have proper debridement in the conventional
      treatment group and debridement plus topical pirfenidone application in the pirfenidone
      group. Subjects will be instructed to do daily ulcer cleansing and for those in the topical
      pirfenidone group, in addition to cleansing they will be instructed to apply the gel twice a

NCT02251418,Shockwave Therapy of Chronic Diabetic Foot Ulcers,"
      Introduction:

      Foot ulcers are a feared complication among diabetic patients. The ulcers can cause pain,
      discomfort and reduced quality of life. The development of foot ulcers places the patients
      at a risk of amputation. In the Danish Health Care System a substantial effort is done to
      prevent and treat diabetic foot ulcers. A constant research of how to treat these wounds is
      ongoing. The goal is to optimize wound healing and prevent amputations.

      Extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) involves the use of a device that generates
      low-energy shockwaves through a headpiece, which is placed on the skin of the patient. A
      small amount of energy will be deposited in the tissue when shockwaves are applied. This
      stimulates the cells to produce substances that generate new vessels. No side effects to
      ESWT have been shown.

      Purpose:

      The investigators want to test whether shockwave therapy can improve wound healing among
      diabetic patients with foot ulcers.

      Hypothesis:

      The investigators hypothesize that shockwave therapy accelerates ulcer healing, increases
      blood flow, reduces pain, and has no side effects.

      Method:

      Patients who are interested in participation will be included in the study and divided by
      randomization into two groups of equal size. The first group is treated with ESWT in
      combination with regular guideline treatment. The second group is set up as control group
      and will only receive regular guideline treatment. The participants are examined in
      different ways to evaluate whether ESWT helps the healing of foot ulcers. The investigators
      want to measure tissue oxygen pressure and foot sense of touch. The foot ulcers are
      inspected for infection at every consultation, and a swab sample will be collected at
      enrollment. The size of the ulcers are measured and photographed each time. The
      investigators will count how many foot ulcers that are completely healed during the test
      period and measure the sizes of the remaining foot ulcers. The patients are asked to
      evaluate pain related to the foot ulcer. Data concerning participants' co morbidities and
      use of analgesic drugs are obtained from the patient journal and by patient interview.

      Significance:

      ESWT should be considered a supplement to existing clinical guidelines in wound management
      if shown to effectively help healing of diabetic foot ulcers. Improved healing should reduce
      the heavy workload on care and treatment regarding to these wounds. Hopefully, the frequency
      of amputations among diabetic patients will decline by implementing new treatment options
      for the diabetic foot.

NCT02458495,The Diabetes Medication Adherence Promotion Intervention Trial,"
      A significant percentage of persons with diabetes fail to properly take their prescribed
      oral hypoglycemic agents (OHA) and insulin. Non-adherence to medications among diabetes
      patients is associated with poor health outcomes including suboptimal glycemic control,
      diabetes-related complications, elevated health costs and increased risk of hospitalization
      and mortality. Given the substantial impact of non-compliance on the health of patients,
      prior studies have sought to draw links between medication adherence and patient factors.

      Research shows that web-based interventions that support patients' medication-related
      knowledge, motivation and skills effectively improve compliance.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of a patient web portal (PWP)-delivered
      medication adherence promotion intervention on medication adherence and glycemic control
      among patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). The intervention aims to (1) increase
      self-reported adherence to glucose lowering agents (GLAs) and (2) improve diabetes health
      outcomes (decreased HbA1c) by increasing patients' medication adherence-related knowledge,
      motivation and skills.

      This research will greatly enhance the investigators' understanding of medicine compliance
      and the factors that effectively improve adherence among high-risk patients with diabetes.

NCT02586519,Pressure-Sensing Insoles in the Neuropathic Ulcer Treatment Pathway,"
      Diabetic foot ulceration (DFU) is a common complication with a 25% lifetime risk in patients
      with diabetes. While most of these ulcers can be treated successfully on an outpatient
      basis, some will persist and become infected. Ultimately, nearly one fifth of patients with
      lower-extremity diabetic ulcers will require amputation of the affected limb, resulting in
      staggering costs for both the patient and the healthcare system. Therapies that promote
      rapid and complete healing and reduce the need for expensive surgical procedures impact
      these costs substantially. Amelioration of pressure, shear, and repetitive injury to the
      sole of the foot are principal tenets of diabetic ulcer care.

      Total Contact Casting (TCC) is considered the gold standard in the treatment of diabetic
      foot ulcers. Despite a body of clinical and laboratory work that suggests TCCs are effective
      and safe, total contact casts are not widely used. Standard removable cast walkers (RCWs)
      have been demonstrated to reduce peak pressures as effectively as TCCs, but in both
      descriptive studies and randomized clinical trials, TCCs have higher rates of healing. A
      logical explanation for RCW's less effective clinical performance is potential non-adherence
      to treatment, on account of their ease of removability. In addressing this limitation of the
      RCW, a modified (made non-removable) version of the RCW has been developed by merely
      wrapping it in a layer of cohesive or plaster bandage. This technique has been termed the
      ""instant"" total contact cast (iTCC). While ease of application and potential clinical
      equivalence are clear benefits, the iTCC carries disadvantages on account of its
      irremovability. For example, frequent dressing changes are not practical. Additionally, some
      complex wounds may require inspection more frequently than once per week, thereby negating
      the potential benefit from irremovable offloading. This provides an opportunity for another
      innovation. The goal of this research is to continue inquiry and innovation in this most
      basic aspect of care, whilst addressing the limitations of past research and failures in
      this domain. The investigators propose examining the capability of the SurroSense Rx™ smart
      insole and smartwatch system (Orpyx Medical Technologies Inc., Calgary AB) in monitoring
      adherence to offloading and in managing plantar pressure offloading by way of alertbased
      feedback during daily living. The insoles are embedded with pressure sensors, which
      wirelessly communicate with a smartwatch that provides feedback on modifying activity or
      pressure profile over time. This smartwatch does so by transmitting audio, visual, and
      tactile alert notifications (feedback) when excessive pressure-time thresholds under plantar
      regions of interest have been met. By providing feedback, this technology can educate
      patients in a continuous fashion regarding their plantar pressure, while engaging them and
      their caregivers to manage adherence to offloading. The investigators also propose comparing
      the healing rates of active neuropathic ulcers using RCWs coupled with the SurroSense Rx™
      smart insole and smartwatch system with that of iTCCs coupled with or without the SurroSense
      Rx™ technology in order to assess whether complemented RCWs could potentially meet optimal
      efficiency and ease of use standards of current active neuropathic ulcer treatments.

      practice but is not countenanced - at least as monotherapy - in formal treatment guidelines.
      This view reflects concerns about the possibility of antidepressant drugs inducing switching
      and rapid cycling in those with Bipolar Disorder. Although the effectiveness of treating
      Bipolar II patients with SSRIs has received very little attention in the literature,
      observations of Bipolar II patients treated with SSRIs suggest they may have general mood
      stabilising properties. Many patients have reported improvements not only in their depressed
      mood, but also a reduction in the severity, duration and frequency of hypomanic episodes.

      In this proof of concept study we specifically assess whether a standard dose of an SSRI
      antidepressant is more effective than placebo in reducing the frequency, severity and
      duration of both depressive and hypomanic episodes.

NCT00174876,Aripiprazole as Augmentation for TRD,"
      A sizeable minority of patients suffering from major depression do not have their full set
      of depressive symptoms relieved by a single medication. Often times, a second medication is
      added to a patient's first antidepressant to obtain a better response in hopes of getting
      the depressed patient into full remission from symptoms.

      A typical psychiatric approach of recent has been to add one of the newer anti-schizophrenia
      medications to an existing FDA approved antidepressant in order to achieve better serotonin
      levels in the depressed patient's brain. This optimization of brain serotonin helps to
      alleviate more depressive symptoms. The newest antipsychotic medication to be FDA approved
      is Aripiprazole (Abilify). It may be particularly effective as it may safely elevate
      sertotonin through receptor 1a stimulation, receptor 2a blockade. It may also facilitate low
      levels of dopamine transmission which is truly novel for this agent when compared to other
      schizophrenia drugs. Depressed patients also tend to lack dopamine in their brains. This
      makes Aripiprazole and ideal agent to boost both serotonin and dopamine simultaneously. In
      theory, this may be an effective way to alleviate more depressive symptoms.

      The author suggests to enroll 10 subjects initially in open label fashion to take
      Aripiprazole plus their current FDA approved antidepressant to see if further elimination of
      depressive symptoms occurs and to show this pharmacological approach as a tolerable
      combination of medications. If there are no major safety issues, an amendment to allow 10
      additional subjects will be forwarded to provide a better tolerability sample size.

NCT00202293,Comparison of Combination Olanzapine+Lithium or Chlorpromazine+Lithium in Treatment of First Manic Episode With Psychotic Features,"
      Aim: In a population of first episode manic patients with psychotic features, we want to
      compare the side effect profile, the degree of adherence and the subjective well being, as
      well as the efficacy of two treatments: The standard treatment currently applied (lithium +
      chlorpromazine) and an alternative treatment more recently introduced (lithium +
      olanzapine). In addition, we want to study retrospectively the development of bipolar
      disorder and study prospectively the 6 and 12-month outcome of a cohort of patients
      presenting a first manic episode with psychotic features.

      Research Background: While the efficacy of lithium in the treatment of acute mania has been
      established by numerous studies, it is also known that up to 50% of the patients fail to
      respond when it is prescribed alone. It is therefore common practice to complement the
      treatment, most commonly with antipsychotics and benzodiazepines. It has been suggested that
      antipsychotic agents are faster acting and are superior in controlling hyperactivity
      compared to lithium, whereas mood stabilisation is better achieved by lithium, Typical
      antipsychotics, such as chlorpromazine, may therefore be useful as adjunctive medication to
      mood stabilisers, especially within the first few weeks of treatment of acute mania, and for
      patients exhibiting psychotic symptoms or hyperactivity. They however can induce side
      effects (somnolence, dizziness, dry mouth, extrapyramidal side effects such as rigidity of
      the muscles, and possibly tardive dyskinesia (involuntary movements or contraction of
      muscles), as well as akathysia (sense of restlessness). They finally have been suspected to
      contribute to the occurrence of post-manic depression. Recent publications in chronic
      populations have shown that atypical antipsychotics, such as olanzapine, are also an
      effective adjunctive treatment. Olanzapine has the important advantage to induce a very low
      incidence of extrapyramidal side effects, including tardive dyskinesia. It can however
      induce somnolence, dizziness, dry mouth, and rather commonly weight gain. Moreover, some
      authors have reported that olanzapine might induce mania. Both treatments appear then to
      have positive effects as well as undesirable side effects. Our project is to compare them.
      The literature concerning first episode mania is sparse, particularly in the domain of
      pharmacotherapy. One retrospective study showed that 77% of the patients received
      antipsychotics at discharge and 25% at 6 months follow-up. No comparison has however been
      made between typical and atypical antipsychotics, and there are no specific treatment
      guidelines of first episode mania with psychotic features.

      Project Summary: The hypothesis is that olanzapine and chlorpromazine will have a comparable
      efficacy as adjunctive treatment of the acute manic episode with psychotic features. We
      however think olanzapine will induce less side effects and will be better accepted by the
      patients, and therefore that the adherence to the treatment will be better than with
      chlorpromazine. We finally think the subjective sense of well being will be greater with
      olanzapine than with chlorpromazine.We will recruit 75 patients at the time of their first
      admission for mania with psychotic features at EPPIC. After signature of the informed
      consent, we will perform a baseline assessment first to confirm the diagnosis, and second to
      evaluate the level of psychopathology. The patients will then be randomly selected to
      receive either a treatment of lithium and olanzapine or a treatment of lithium and
      chlorpromazine. By the end of the study there will be 37 patients in each group.The patients
      will go through a baseline assessment including physical examination and usual laboratory
      investigation to exclude any physical illness. They will also go through a one-hour
      assessment of psychopathology. Between day 2 and 3 they will go through 2 hours of interview
      to reassess diagnosis and personal history. They will thereafter be assessed weekly for
      eight weeks on various dimensions: evolution of the intensity of the symptoms, appearance of
      depressive symptoms, occurrence of side effects and degree of adherence to the treatment, in
      an 1-hour interview. Subjective well being and quality of life will re evaluated at week 4
      and 8, adding 45 minutes to the duration of the interview. This is a flexible dose, open
      trial, which means the doctor in charge of the patient will know which medication is being
      prescribed, and that he will be allowed to adapt the dosage according to what he feels
      necessary. This research project will allow us to organise a more specialised clinic for the
      care of first episode manic patients. We will take this opportunity to study carefully the
      months preceding the appearance of the first episode in order to try to reconstruct the
      prodrome of bipolar disorders. We will also, in an extension phase of the study, look at the
      long term outcome (at 6 and 12 months) of a first episode of mania.

      Funding: An investigator-initiated trial funded by H. Lundbeck AS.

      Study design: Prospective, randomised, placebo-controlled parallel-group multicenter study.

      Aim: To investigate efficacy and side effects (especially mood switches) of escitalopram,a
      selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, in the acute and maintenance treatment of bipolar
      depression.

      Hypotheses:

        1. Escitalopram, given in addition to mood stabilising medications, is significantly more
           efficacious, measured by response and remission rates than placebo in bipolar
           depression (the acute phase study).

        2. Continuation therapy with escitalopram gives significantly longer mean time to
           depressive relapse and fewer depressive relapses compared to placebo (the continuation
           study).

        3. The incidence of ""mood switching"" (defined as development of mixed episodes, mania, or
           hypomania according to DSM-IV criteria) do not differ significantly between
           escitalopram and placebo in either the acute or the continuation phases.

      Patients: In- and outpatients receiving care in the specialised psychiatric services of
      Western Norway. The population is intended to be representative of the patients treated for
      bipolar depression in ordinary specialist care. Patients must have a MADRS score of at least
      20 at baseline. Patients with ongoing substance abuse or dependence, organic mental illness,
      and non-affective psychotic symptoms are excluded.

      Medication: Escitalopram 10-20 mg daily or placebo in addition to mood stabilisers. The dose
      of mood stabilisers must have been constant for the last six weeks prior to randomisation.

      Method: Phase 1 is a eight-week acute treatment trial with six clinical assessments.
      Patients treated with escitalopram who have not responded after eight weeks (defined by at
      least 50% reduction of MADRS score compared to baseline) leave the study. Placebo
      non-responders are treated openly with escitalopram and repeat phase 1. Responders are
      re-randomised to 32 weeks of maintenance treatment (phase 2). Phase 2 has nine clinical
      assessments. Patients who develop hypomania, mania or depressive episodes (defined as
      episodes meeting DSM-IV criteria for Major Depressive Episode with MADRS scores of at least
      20 points) leave the study in this phase. Patients leaving the study prematurely will be
      offered alternative treatment.

NCT00662155,The Role of Partial Reinforcement in the Long Term Management of Insomnia,"
      The lack of scientific attention devoted to the placebo effect as a phenomenon in its own
      right probably reflects the paucity of theoretical positions within which to organize the
      existing data and design new research. The proposed investigation 1) is an attempt to
      advance from a descriptive to an experimental analysis of the placebo effect, taking into
      account classical conditioning effects, and 2) examines the clinical implications of partial
      reinforcement as it is applied to the treatment of insomnia. Subjects with primary insomnia
      will be treated with zolpidem for a period of one month and then randomized to one of four
      groups for a period of 12 weeks: one receiving full dose zolpidem on a nightly basis
      (continuous reinforcement), one receiving full dose zolpidem on 14 of 28 nights where
      placebo is provided on non-drug nights (partial reinforcement), one receiving full dose
      zolpidem on 14 of 28 nights where no pills are imbibed on non-drug nights (intermittent
      dosing), and one receiving 5 mg dose zolpidem on a nightly basis (continuous reinforcement
      with half the standard dose). Following treatment, subjects will be entered into an
      extinction protocol during which they will 1) continue on the schedule assigned during the
      experimental period, 2) receive only placebo, or 3) receive neither drug nor placebo. Sleep
      and daily functioning will be monitored on a daily basis via sleep diaries for the duration
      of the study. It is hypothesized that, holding cumulative dose constant, a partial schedule
      of reinforcement will enable patients to better maintain their clinical gains as compared to
      subjects that receive either continuous reinforcement with half the standard dose or half
      the frequency of use.

      Relevance: The proposed research is not an attempt to offer a behavioral alternative to drug
      treatment; it is an attempt to acknowledge and capitalize on a behavioral dimension in the
      design of drug treatment protocols. The value of the proposed research resides in its
      capacity to provide for the long term treatment of insomnia in a manner that increases the
      durability of pharmacotherapy while reducing the overall amount of medication required. If
      proven effective in the current application, this new approach to pharmacotherapy and
      placebo effects is likely to stimulate new interdisciplinary research for the treatment of a
      variety of chronic diseases.

      The study attempts to evaluate a histamine analog long used for the treatment of Meniere's
      disease , betahistine, that,.shows promise in reversing the antihistaminergic effects
      thought to be involved in antipsychotic induced weight gain.

      The investigators hypotheses therefore are as follows:

        -  Youth who have gained a developmentally inappropriate amount of weight on SGAs will see
           their weight stabilize or even decrease with betahistine augmentation as compared to
           placebo augmentation.

        -  Betahistine augmentation in SGA treated youth will increase levels of satiety in a
           standardized meal situation and decrease caloric intake.as compared to placebo
           augmentation.

        -  Metabolic effects of betahistine augmentation in SGA treated youth will be reflected in
           a normalization of adipose distribution when compared to placebo augmentation, in
           particular with regards to the ratio of visceral to peripheral adipose tissue.

        -  Betahistine augmentation in this population will lead to a normalization in physiologic
           and lab values related to the development of metabolic syndrome as compared to placebo
           augmentation.

NCT00838032,Pilot Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Quetiapine Fumarate Instant-Release (Seroquel IR) in Controlling Agitation and Aggressive Symptoms in the Acute Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia,"
      Quetiapine fumarate is indicated for the treatment of patients with schizophrenia in China.
      Lots of clinical experience and evidence has demonstrated its efficacy and tolerability for
      the patient population. Some evidence showed that quetiapine fumarate could control
      aggression and agitation within 1 week, which is appropriate for the acute treatment of
      patients with schizophrenia. PANSS and MOAS are the common measurements for the efficacy of
      psychotic symptoms controlling in the clinical trials. Generally, 2 weeks are the
      appropriate timeframe for the evaluation of clinical effect of agitation and aggression
      symptoms controlling.

      In adult patients with schizophrenia, quetiapine fumarate is licensed to maximal dose of
      750mg/day. The target dose of quetiapine fumarate recommended in the manufacturer's
      prescribing information is 300-450 mg/day in China, though similar efficacy for quetiapine
      fumarate (600 mg/day), olanzapine (15 mg/day) and Risperidone (5 mg/day) was reported in a
      small, randomised, rater-blinded trial. Because of the low incidence of EPS, the limitation
      potential for weight gain and prolactin elevation, quetiapine fumarate should be well
      tolerated in this sensitive patient population with higher dose (600mg/day-750mg/day)
      (Peuskens 2004).

      The aim of the present study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of quetiapine fumarate

NCT00957359,Psilocybin Cancer Anxiety Study,"
      The primary objective of this double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study is to assess the
      efficacy of psilocybin administration (4-phosphoryloxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine), a
      serotonergic psychoactive agent, on psychosocial distress, with the specific primary outcome
      variable being anxiety associated with cancer. Secondary outcome measures will look at the
      effect of psilocybin on symptoms of pain perception, depression, existential/psychospiritual
      distress, attitudes towards disease progression and death, quality of life, and
      spiritual/mystical states of consciousness. In addition, a secondary objective of the study
      is to determine the feasibility of administering psilocybin to this patient population, with
      regards to the following issues: safety, patient recruitment, consent for treatment, and
      retention. The duration of the proposed investigation will be long enough to administer the
      drug one time to each of thirty-two patients and to conduct follow-up assessments. This
      study is separate but similar to a recently completed study at the Los Angeles Biomedical
      Research Institute at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, run by a psychiatrist, Dr. Charles Grob.
      Although the outcomes measures would be similar to those used as in the Grob study, the
      proposed dose of psilocybin is higher at 0.3mg/kg and the total subjects for the study would
      be 32 instead of 12. The study utilizes a cross-over design at 7 weeks and includes
      prospective follow-up of 6 months duration. This study has been approved by the Bellevue
      Psychiatry Research Committee, the NYU Oncology PRMC Committee, the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) through the issuance of an IND (77,138), the New York University School
      of Medicine Institutional Review Board (NYU IRB), the Health and Hospitals Corporation
      (HHC)-New York University (NYU) Clinical Translational Science Institute (CTSI), the NYU
      Bluestone Center for Clinical Research, and the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) through the
      issuance of a schedule I license.

      It is hypothesized that a one time experience with psilocybin will occasion dramatic shifts
      in consciousness and awareness that will lead to short-term (ie hours to days) and long-term
      (up to 6 months in this study, following the administration of the second dosing, either
      psilocybin or placebo) improvement in anxiety, depression, and pain associated with advanced
      cancer. The exact mechanism of action is unclear but based on studies done in the 60's using
      serotonergic hallucinogens in patients with advanced cancer, improvements in anxiety levels,
      mood and pain were reported. However, a treatment model developed by the famous British
      psychiatrist Humphrey Osmond, offers one possibility. In this model, serotonergic
      hallucinogens' therapeutic mechanism lies in their ability to allow the individual to access
      novel dimensions of consciousness and their efficacy or lack thereof relies on whether a
      transcendent and mystical state of awareness is attained. Another possible mechanism relates
      to what Dobkin de Rios and Grob have described as 'managed altered states of consciousness,'
      where the power of suggestibility, occurring in a safe setting, allows one to transcend a
      particular state of consciousness (i.e. anxiety and depression associated with advanced
      illness) as a means to facilitate emotional discharge and to manage irreconcilable conflict.

NCT01012180,Parents With Bipolar Disorder: Relationship of Adaptation to Own Illness With Risk Perception and Coping With Perceived Risk to a Child,"
      Background:

        -  Bipolar disorder is a common mood disorder that affects 1% to 2% of the population.
           Individuals with bipolar disorder tend to have periods of mania that are characterized
           by extra energy, very poor judgment or unrealistic beliefs about their thoughts and
           abilities, and an inability to complete thoughts and tasks; as well as major depressive
           episodes. The range and frequency of symptoms in affected individuals can vary greatly.
           Most individuals have cyclical symptoms and spend more time in a normal mood state than
           in an overtly symptomatic state.

        -  Relatives of individuals with bipolar disorder have an increased risk for bipolar
           disorder and other mood disorders. Currently, risk assessment for recurrence of a mood
           disorder is based on family and medical histories; genetic testing has not proved
           particularly useful to date for assessing risks of a mood disorder.

        -  Despite its prevalence, there is limited research on coping with bipolar illness. No
           published studies have examined adaptation to living with bipolar disorder or risk for
           bipolar disorder. More specifically, though a positive family history is the most
           important known risk factor for bipolar disorder, there are no published studies about
           response to the threat of future illness onset in children, risk modification efforts
           undertaken by affected parents, or coping with the risk for illness in children.

      Objectives:

        -  To examine parents appraisals of the impact and cause of bipolar disorder, and the
           association with their perceived risk for bipolar illness in their child and how they
           cope with their perception of risk to their child.

        -  To assess whether parents adaptation to their own illness is associated with coping
           with perceived risk to their child.

        -  To describe parents coping strategies related to perceived risk in their children.

      Eligibility:

      - Men and women at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and
      who have at least one biological child (30 years of age or younger). Participants must be a
      primary caregiver for their children.

      Design:

        -  Participants in this study will take an online survey and answer questions about
           disease perceptions, coping strategies, and adapting to a diagnosis of bipolar
           disorder, addressing issues such as the following:

        -  Assessing the threat of bipolar disorder and coping with one s own illness.

        -  Optimism/pessimism of the individual coping with the illness.

        -  Perception of risk to a child, and coping with the perceived risk.

        -  Data from this study will not be shared with the participants/respondents.

      Study Design This is the second study of a multiphase, multicenter trial that will
      comprehensively examine lithium in the treatment of pediatric participants with bipolar I
      disorder. In order to examine the treatment of bipolar disorder with lithium, this study
      will include four phases of treatment. The first phase, the Efficacy Phase, will include
      participants being randomized to either lithium or placebo for 8 weeks to determine the
      efficacy of lithium in the treatment of children and adolescents with bipolar I disorder.
      Once participants complete the Efficacy Phase, participants may be eligible to continue in
      the Long- Term Effectiveness Phase for a maximum of 24 weeks of lithium treatment.
      Subsequently, participants meeting response criteria during the Long-Term Effectiveness
      Phase will be eligible to continue in the Discontinuation Phase. During the Discontinuation
      Phase, participants will be randomized to either placebo or lithium treatment for up to 28
      weeks. Finally, those participants who experience a mood relapse during the Discontinuation
      Phase will be enrolled in an Open Label Restabilization Phase and treated with lithium for
      up to 8 weeks.

NCT01184443,Evaluation of the Efficacy and Safety of Olanzapine for Anorexia Nervosa in Children and Adolescents,"
      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the atypical
      antipsychotic, olanzapine, for the treatment of youth suffering from Anorexia Nervosa (AN).

      Adolescent males and females between the ages of 11 and 17 years who are being treated by a
      physician on the Eating Disorder team at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario will be
      invited to join the study if they have been diagnosed with AN or Eating Disorder Not
      Otherwise Specified (EDNOS), and if they weigh less than or equal to 85% of their ideal body
      weight. Those who meet inclusion and not exclusion criteria, and consent to participating in
      the trial will be offered adjunctive treatment with olanzapine. Those who agree to take
      olanzapine will belong to the olanzapine group, and those who decline will belong to the
      comparison group. Olanzapine doses will be in keeping with the investigators current
      clinical practice, with flex doses ranging from 1.25 mg to 10.0 mg daily (the majority of
      patients are treated with 2.5 mg or 5.0 mg at bedtime); dose adjustments made based on
      individual need and tolerability. Participants will remain in the study for 12 weeks. Those
      who initially decline olanzapine treatment may change their minds and take olanzapine up
      until week 9 of the trial.

      It is hypothesized that those children and adolescents who choose to take olanzapine at
      entry into the trial will be more motivated to recover and more compliant with treatment.
      Compared to those who do not receive medication, it is expected that these adolescents will
      demonstrate reduced disordered eating attitudes and behaviours, as well as an increased rate
      of weight gain.

      Finally, it is predicted that the rates of discontinuation and the adverse effects of
      olanzapine will be minor given the relatively low dose (as compared to treatment for
      patients with schizophrenia), slow titration, and short-term use of olanzapine the
      investigators will be using.

      By comparing the well-being and outcome of patients in the two groups, the investigators
      hope to begin to answer the question of whether olanzapine does or does not lead to improved
      clinical outcome for patients with severe eating disorders such as AN or EDNOS, and the
      question of whether the benefits of using the medication outweigh the risks.

NCT01293825,Ziprasidone Switching in Response to Adherence and Psychotropic-Related Weight Gain Concerns Among Patients With Bipolar Disorder (Zip Ad),"
      Psychotropic-related weight gain is a common concern among patients with bipolar disorder
      (BD). This concern affects an individual's satisfaction with treatment and may lead to
      reduced adherence and illness relapse. Patient-focused care is attentive to patient concerns
      while at the same time utilizing evidence-based treatments. Ziprasidone is currently FDA
      approved for the maintenance treatment of BD. Ziprasidone may be associated with less weight
      gain compared to some alternative BD maintenance treatments. The proposed project will
      evaluate how switching to ziprasidone may affect patient adherence, drug attitudes,
      satisfaction with care and clinical outcomes (psychiatric symptoms, functional status,
      weight) among BD patients concerned with weight gain.

NCT01363310,The Quietude Study: Quetiapine Use for Agitated Depression,"
      Most individuals with major depressive disorder manifest clinically significant agitation.
      Concurrent agitation in a depressed individual is associated with an intensification of mood
      symptoms, decreased probability of recovery, increased recurrence risk, suicidality, and
      increased medical-service utilization. The occurrence of anxiety/agitation phenomenology in
      the depressed patient often invites the need for augmentation strategies (e.g. atypical
      antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, etc.) and complicated polypharmacy regimens. Moreover,
      individuals with major depressive disorder often report worsening of symptom severity,
      irritability, hostility, dysphoria, and significant subjective distress (This response
      pattern is similar to individuals with bipolar disorder).

      Results from large research studies provide evidence indicating that quetiapine is capable
      of offering clinically significant multidimensional symptom relief in bipolar depression.
      Moreover, results from several trials in major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety
      disorder have established the efficacy of quetiapine therapy for unipolar depression and
      anxiety syndromes. So far, no atypical antipsychotic agent has been evaluated specifically
      for the treatment of agitated depression.

      In this study, it is hypothesized that persons with major depressive disorder and prominent
      agitation (i.e. agitated depression) will exhibit a more favourable response and
      tolerability profile to quetiapine XR when compared to escitalopram.

NCT01385709,The Influence of the Menstrual Cycle on Lithium and Sertraline Blood Levels,"
      The aim of this study is to determine whether blood levels of lithium or sertraline are
      affected by different phases of the menstrual cycle and whether there is an effect on
      psychiatric symptoms. Subjects are seen for two visits: one visit during the luteal phase
      and one visit during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. On each visit, they will
      fill out a depression, anxiety and mania rating scale. Also at each visit a 20mL blood
      sample will be drawn to measure progesterone level and either a lithium or sertraline level,
      depending on which medication the patient takes. The primary hypothesis in this study is
      that blood levels of lithium and sertraline will be significantly lower in women during the
      luteal phase of the menstrual cycle than during the follicular phase. Examination will also
      be made of whether symptoms will increase in severity during the luteal phase as compared to
      the follicular phase. The investigators expect a negative linear association between symptom
      severity and blood level, i.e. expect symptom severity to worsen as blood levels of lithium
      or sertraline decrease.

NCT01491490,Treatment on Iatrogenic Weight Gain and Dyslipidaemia Associated With Olanzapine,"
      Olanzapine is one of the most effective and best tolerated of the atypical antipsychotics,
      but it is also particularly associated with weight gain and metabolic problems.

      This study is being conducted by GW Pharma Ltd as a pilot study in order to determine the
      efficacy and safety of two medications GW42003 and GW42004 as a 40:1 ratio when combined
      with the subjects existing treatment of olanzapine in subjects with weight gain attributable
      to olanzapine treatment for functional psychosis. This is the first study to determine
      whether the study medications have a positive benefit for subjects on their cholesterol
      levels, body weight and other metabolic parameters, as well as a potential augmentation of
      the anti-psychotic effect of olanzapine.

      This is a multi-centre randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group pilot
      study. There will be two groups of subjects (GWP42003 plus GWP42004 (40:1 ratio) and
      placebo), with a treatment duration of 6 weeks as well as a baseline period of variable
      length and one week follow-up. The two treatment groups will be randomised equally.

      In order to be eligible for enrollment in this study, subjects will need to be aged 18 years
      and above and be clinically diagnosed with functional psychosis and receiving olanzapine
      treatment for no more than 3 months with evidence of weight gain attributable to olanzapine
      treatment.

      Eligible subjects will enter the study at a screening visit (Visit 1) and commence a
      baseline period. Subjects will also be assessed at Visit 2 for further weight gain during
      the baseline period. The baseline period is flexible in length to allow time for this weight
      gain to be achieved and also for the olanzapine dose to be stabilised. If eligible the
      subject will be randomised into the 6-week treatment phase. There are a total of 6 visits in

      related to suicidal ideas, and (3) treatment of insomnia with hypnotics leads to a reduction
      of suicidal ideation. We now propose to test whether cautious use of hypnotics in suicidal,

      Objectives :

      The key objective of this study is to develop new interventions that addresses the diverse
      needs and circumstances of Hong Kong adolescents with depressive symptoms in community
      settings. Collaboration between medical professionals and social workers may prevent the
      occurrence of depression and misguided attempts to self-treat with alcohol and / or drugs in
      our adolescents.

      Methods :

      To address this intervention gap in the United States, Dr. Van Voorhees, a research
      collaborator of Dr. Chim and Dr. Ip, developed and conducted a phase 2 clinical trial of a
      primary care internet-based depression prevention intervention (CATCH-IT, Competent
      Adulthood Transition with Cognitive Behavioral Humanistic and Interpersonal training). It
      has been observed clinically that the strategy could reduce depressed mood, increased social
      support and reduced depressive episodes at 12 month follow-up.

      The investigators now propose to study if an adaptation of the CATCH-IT website for Hong
      Kong Chinese adolescents may lead to significant reductions in depressed mood. In this pilot
      trial, the investigators propose to test the efficacy of the Adapted and Translated version
      of CATCH-IT (AT-CATCH) against the placebo approach in preventing the onset of depressive
      episodes in a group of adolescents (aged 13-17) who have depressive symptoms, but have not
      developed depression yet.The case group will have access to the AT-CATCH website while the
      control group will only be allow to use the anti-smoking website.

      The investigators hypothesize that compared to youth in the control group, youth assigned to
      the AT-CATCH group will have a lower hazard ratio of major depressive episodes and decreased
      alcohol / drug use frequency over 2 years. Moreover, compared to youth in the control group,
      youth in the AT-CATCH program will demonstrate a steeper slope of improved symptoms through

NCT01863628,Recognition and Early Intervention on Prodrome in Bipolar Disorders,"
      Background and study hypothesis:

      Many studies including prospective studies have been demonstrated that a long symptomatic
      prodromal phase exists prior to the onset of full-brown bipolar disorder, lasting for 9-12
      years (Egeland et al., 2000). During the prodromal stage, there are three main clusters of
      syndromes, including hypomania/mania symptoms, depressive symptoms, and signs of attention
      deficit hyperactivity disorders (Correll et al., 2007; Tillman et al., 2003; Mantere et al.,
      2008). Of the hypomania/mania symptoms, decreased sleep, elevated mood, irritability, mood
      lability, increased energy, and psychomotor agitation are present most frequently. The
      prodromal depressive symptoms are reported to be depressed mood, anhedonia, insomnia,
      feelings of worthlessness. Among patients with bipolar disorders, 22.5% reported to comorbid
      with pediatric ADHD. In addition, some symptoms are considered as non-specific such as
      decreased functioning, anger outburst, social isolation, and anxiety (Egeland et al., 2000).

      Offspring of parents with bipolar disorders are much likely to present prodromal symptoms
      compared to offspring of healthy parents. In a 10-year longitudinal study using 55 prodromal
      symptoms checklist, , Egeland et al.(2002) found that 38% offspring of parents with bipolar
      disorder were considered as at risk compared to 17% in children of healthy parents. In a
      15-year follow-up study, Duffy et al.,(2009) found that 32.7% offspring (aged 8-25 years
      old) of parents with bipolar disorder met the criteria of major mood episode.

      Objectives:

      One primary objective of this study is to prospectively identify the prodromal stage of
      bipolar disorder.

      Another primary objective is to conduct a randomized, place-controlled trial of aerobic
      exercise on people who suffering from prodromal symptoms to the extent of significantly
      impaired function, with attempt at delaying or preventing the onset of a full-blown bipolar
      disorder.

      Design of study and the procedures:

      The study will consist of two phases: one-week screening period and a randomized,
      placebo-controlled, 3-month trial. During the screening period, offspring of parents with
      bipolar disorder will undergo systematically clinical evaluations. The offspring will be
      evaluated with clinical symptoms assessing scales, neuropsychological tests, magnetic
      resonance imaging. During the 3-month trial period, the offspring who meet the inclusion
      criteria will be randomly assigned to receive treatment of aerobic exercise, placebo, or
      wait-list group. Psychiatrists are scheduled to assess mood, treatment outcome during the
      3-month trial.

      Subjects and treatment It is expected that 120 offspring of parents with bipolar disorder
      aged between 10—25 years, meeting the inclusion of prodromal stage, will be included in the
      study. All of the offspring will undertake the Kiddie Sads Present and Lifetime Version
      (K-SADS-PL), and a 70 checklist items of potential prodromal symptoms suggest by us as well
      as by Dr. Correll et al. (2007). The parents of these offspring are to have a DSM-IV
      (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders)-defined bipolar disorder (bipolar I
      or II), confirmed by the Chinese version of Structured Clinical interview for DSM-IV-TR Axis
      I Disorders patient edition (SCID-I/P) [First et al., 2002]. The offspring are to be
      recruited through the referrals by their parents who will receive psychiatric services in
      the Guangzhou psychiatric Hospital.

      The offspring will be randomly assigned to aerobic exercise and placebo controlled groups.
      The aerobic exercise would include cycling, jogging,table tennis, and playing badminton for
      40 mins at least 3 times a week for 3 months. In each exercise, participants are supposed to
      exercise to the extent of getting sweaty. In the placebo group, participants will receive
      general psychoeducation, including delivering knowledge on symptoms, discussion of the
      suffering mental difficulties, and general coping techniques.

      Significance:

      Bipolar disorder is a common, chronic, and recurrent mental disorder. The recognition of
      prodromal stage of bipolar disorder and the early intervention on it may help delay or
      prevent the onset of bipolar disorder.

      treatment-as-usual with pharmacotherapy (TAU) plus 18 one-hour sessions of treatment with
      the UP to TAU alone. Patients in both treatment conditions will be followed over a 12-month

      symptoms; functional impairment; and relapse rates. Data on the acceptability of the
      treatment will be gathered concurrently through monthly patient self-reported ratings of
      treatment satisfaction, and by tracking rates of acceptance for randomization into the
      study, number of completed sessions, and dropout rates. The study will examine: 1) whether
      combined cognitive behavioral treatment (UP) for BD-I and comorbid anxiety disorders is an
      acceptable and feasible approach to treatment; 2) whether treatment with the UP for BD-I and
      comorbid anxiety disorders as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy treatment-as-usual (TAU) leads

      Background:

      Bipolar disorder is one of the most common mental illnesses affecting 1%-4% of the
      population, and one of the leading causes of worldwide disability. Mania is a condition of
      excessively elevated mood, characterizes bipolar disorder, and usually is a main cause of
      hospitalization. Mood stabilisers and antipsychotic drugs have long been the maintenance
      treatment of acute mania with and without psychotic symptoms. Though clinical trails have
      been demonstrated that these drugs are individually more effective than placebo in the
      relatively long term (e.g 4, 8 weeks). However, in the pragmatic practice, patient at acute
      mania urgently want to see the effectiveness, and psychiatrist under great pressure and are
      in great need to evaluate the very short-term effectiveness (e.g one week). If the first
      attempted antimanic drug fails, psychiatrist need the evidence that which medication should
      be to added on or switch to.

      hospital in the history of China established by Dr.J. G. Kerr in 1898.

      Design:This study is a randomized, controlled trial. Participants with a Diagnostic and
      Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) diagnosis of bipolar I
      disorder, manic or mixed episode will be randomly assigned to a treatment of Lithium,
      Valproate, Oxcarbazepine, Quetiapine, Olanzapine, or Ziprasidone. In the following
      conditions, participants will take another antimanic drug as a combination medication: 1)
      those who have a reduction in YMRS scores less than 25% after one week of treatment; 2)
      those who have a reduction in YMRS scores less than 50% after two weeks of treatment; or 3)
      those who have a increase in YMRS more than 30% at day 4. An antipsychotic (Quetiapine,
      Olanzapine, and Ziprasidone) will be added on for those who use lithium, Valproate or
      Oxcarbazepine as a first attempted medication; while Lithium, Valproate, or Oxcarbazepine
      will be added on for those who use an antipsychotic as a first attempted medication. Those
      participants who are recognized as non-response/partial response to two combined medications
      after 6 weeks of treatment will switch to Modified Electroconvulsive Therapy (MECT).

      Measures: Primary outcome measures are change scores on the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS)
      and dropout rates. Secondary outcome measures include Clinical Global Impressions (CGI)
      Scale, Global Assessment Scale (GAS), Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale (TESS), and Brief
      Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS).

      Response criteria: <25% reduction in YMRS scores or >=4 scores of CGI is defined as
      non-response. 25-49% reduction in YMRS scores from baseline as well as <=3 scores of
      Clinical General Impression (CGI) is recognized as partial response.>= 50% reduction in YMRS
      as well as 1 (very much improved) or 2 scores (much improved) of CGI is recognized as
      response. Remission is defined as a YMRS score <=12 and CGI score equal to 1 or 2.

NCT01928446,Lithium for Suicidal Behavior in Mood Disorders,"
      Observational evidence and findings from clinical trials conducted for other reasons suggest
      that lithium, a drug used for the treatment of bipolar disorder, and, to a lesser extent,
      depression, may reduce rates of suicides and suicide attempts. However, this hypothesis has
      not yet been adequately examined in a randomized clinical trial conducted specifically to
      test lithium's efficacy in preventing suicides. This clinical trial fills this gap.

      This study is feasible within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) because it is a large,
      integrated health system with existing programs for identifying patients at risk for suicide
      and delivering enhanced services. In VA, approximately 12,000 patients with depression or
      bipolar disorder survive a suicide attempt or related behavior each year, and 15% of them
      repeat within one year. Experimental treatment in this study will supplement usual care for
      major depression or bipolar disorder, as well as VA's standard, enhanced management for
      patients at high risk.

      The investigators will recruit 1862 study participants, from approximately 30 VA Hospitals.
      Participants will be patients with bipolar disorder or depression who have survived a recent
      episode of suicidal self-directed violence or were hospitalized specifically to prevent
      suicide. Randomly, half will receive lithium, and half will receive placebo. Neither the
      patients nor their doctors will know whether a particular person has received lithium or
      placebo. The treatment will be administered and the patients will be followed for one year,
      after which patients will go back to usual care. Recruitment will occur over 3 years.

      The investigators are primarily interested in whether lithium leads to increases in the time
      to the first repeated episode of suicidal behavior, including suicide attempts, interrupted
      attempts, hospitalizations specifically to prevent suicide, and deaths from suicide. In
      addition, this study will allow us to explore whether lithium decreases the total number of
      suicidal behaviors, and whether it has comparable effects on impulsive and non-impulsive
      behaviors. If there is an effect of lithium, the investigators will be interested in whether
      or not it could be attributed to improved control of the underlying mental health condition,
      or, alternatively, whether it represents a direct effect of suicide-related behavior.

      Before and after this 8-week trial, children will have a special magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI) scan.

      This is a test of feasibility--meaning we want to see if the 8-week trial results in brain
      changes.

      If it does, we will conduct a second study to see if it improves how bipolar children
      function--i.e., if it helps their illness.

NCT02003690,Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) for Adolescents With Bipolar Disorder,"
      Of all psychiatric diagnoses, bipolar disorder imparts the greatest risk for completed
      suicide in adolescence, and is further associated with poor psychosocial functioning,
      substance abuse and legal difficulties, and exorbitant healthcare costs exceeding those for
      other adolescent psychiatric conditions. Treatment guidelines indicate optimal management of
      pediatric bipolar disorder includes a combination of medication and psychotherapy. Yet,
      little is known about effective psychotherapy approaches for this population, and none
      expressly target suicidality. An efficacious, cost-effective psychosocial intervention for
      adolescents with bipolar disorder has great potential to decrease the substantial morbidity,
      mortality and costs associated with adolescent bipolar disorder.

NCT02033915,The Effectiveness of Interactive Discussion Group Intervention About Suicide Risk Identification and Assessment for Clinical Nurses,"
      Suicide attempters or people with self-harm have a high percentage in seeking medical
      services before and after their suicidal or self-harm behaviour compared to general
      population. Studies revealed that apart from psychiatric services, they were more likely to
      seek help from doctors of various units (e.g. emergency departments, general medicine,
      medical-surgical units) across different healthcare systems (i.e. hospitals or district
      clinics). Besides, suicide event was possibly heard on in-patients of psychiatric or
      non-psychiatric units. People with self-harm experienced poor communication with healthcare
      personnel, and they perceived staff's lacking knowledge about suicide as serious problems.
      In Taiwan it was also found that emergency nurses and general practitioners were in need of
      improving negative attitudes and enhancing knowledge towards suicidal behaviour. From the
      point that nurses are the healthcare personnel that spend the most time with in-patients
      compared to others in the hospital, suicide risk assessment training may enhance nurses'
      attitudes and ability of risk awareness and assessment towards people with self-harm, which
      may in turn significantly increase the identification rate of the high risk group for
      suicide. Currently there is a lack of suicide training program as a reference for nursing
      education in Taiwan. The study therefore aims to strengthen suicide risk assessment ability
      among clinical nurses through interactive discussion groups. Using quasi-experimental design
      with randomized cluster sampling strategy, a case vignettes will be used for suicide risk
      assessment together with other measurements regarding suicide knowledge and attitudes for
      both experiment and control groups before and after the training course.

      Major depressive disorder (MDD) occurs at least 11% of adolescents and approximately 53-90%
      of those adolescents have insomnia. If left untreated, insomnia increases the risk of
      relapse and recurrence of depressive episodes, unintentional injuries, poor school
      performance, substance use, obesity, and the risk for suicide. This project seeks to develop
      a nonpharmacological treatment for insomnia in adolescents with depression that is feasible
      and effective. The specific methodologies that will help accomplish these results are: 1)
      use of focus groups of adolescents with depression and insomnia to determine how the current
      standard, nonpharmacological treatment for insomnia (cognitive-behavioral therapy for
      insomnia; CBTI) among adults can be modified for use by adolescents with depression and 2)

NCT02281162,The Influence of Vitamin D on Atypical Antipsychotic-induced Weight Gain,"
      Schizophrenia and bipolar disorders are major public health problems. The second generation
      anti-psychotic drugs have efficacy for both positive and negative symptoms and a favorable
      risk profile as far as movement disorders. However, these drugs are associated with
      clinically significant weight gain and metabolic effects. The underlying mechanisms of these
      side effects are unclear, however in our preliminary studies with schizophrenic patients on
      atypical anti-psychotic drugs, we found that weight gain and vitamin D deficiency was
      present in about 50% of this population. Given the considerable heterogeneity among the
      patients on atypical anti-psychotics and potential for weight gain in vitamin D-deficient
      states, we propose that patients with schizophrenia who gain weight on atypical
      antipsychotic medications are vitamin D-deficient. This hypothesis will be tested in
      patients with schizophrenia receiving second-generation anti-psychotic drugs for a minimum
      duration of 4 months. Specific Aim: We predict that the patients with schizophrenia, who
      gain weight with antipsychotic treatment, are vitamin D-deficient compared to the patients
      who do not gain weight. We will examine circulating levels of serum 25(OH)D, mRNA
      transcripts and protein expression of vitamin D receptor (VDR) and the enzymes, CYP24A and

      Depression and suicidal ideation/attempt/death are major causes of morbidity and mortality
      from psychiatric illnesses. In 2009, the World Health Organization listed depression as the
      leading cause of years lost due to disability worldwide. Suicide is the 9th most common
      cause of death in Canada with 1.6% of Canadians ultimately dying from suicide (Statistics
      Canada, 2012) and the 2nd most common cause of death in young people after accidental
      deaths. This information highlights the importance of finding treatments to prevent suicidal
      deaths.

      Ketamine has been shown to provide rapid treatment response for major depressive episodes

NCT00040196,How the Loss of Dopamine and Dopamine-Restoring Medicines Affect Movement Performance,"
      This study has two purposes: 1) to understand the effect of a decline of dopamine in the
      brain during normal aging and in patients with Parkinson's disease, and 2) to investigate
      how medicines used to treat Parkinson's disease improve movement performance in patients.

      Patients with Parkinson's disease have difficulty performing precise finger movements,
      mainly because of a dramatic decrease of a substance called dopamine in parts of the brain.
      Medicines such as levodopa, which help restore dopamine levels, can greatly improve
      function; however, little is known about how these drugs work. In normal aging, dopamine
      decreases slightly in certain parts of the brain, but the importance of this decline is
      poorly understood. This study may provide new information about Parkinson's disease and
      normal aging that might lead to better treatment strategies.

      Patients with mild to moderate Parkinson's disease and healthy volunteers 21 years of age
      and older may be eligible for this study. All participants must be right-handed. All
      candidates will be screened with a medical history and physical and neurological
      examinations, including memory tests and mood examination.

      Brain function will be studied using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study and
      positron emission tomography (PET). Participants may be asked to stop using medications that
      can affect the central nervous system, such as sleeping pills or drugs for depression or
      anxiety, for 1 week before each study visit. Patients with Parkinson's disease may also be
      asked to stop using antiparkinsonian medications at least 12 hours before each visit. In
      addition, all participants will be asked to abstain from alcoholic beverages at least 24
      hours before the fMRI and PET scans, and from nicotine and caffeine for at least 12 hours
      before the scans.

      Participants will have fMRI, which uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to create
      images of the brain. The subject lies on a table in a tunnel-like cylinder (the scanner) for
      1 to 2 hours, lying still for 5 to 15 minutes at a time. He or she can communicate with the
      technician or researcher at all times during the test through an intercom system. Scans will
      be done while the subject is at rest and while he or she is performing finger movements. The
      movements involve pushing five buttons on a box-each button every 3 seconds on average in a
      specific order. Patients with Parkinson's disease will be studied off- and then on-
      medications that restore the levels of levodopa in the brain.

      Some participants may be asked to undergo a PET scan on a separate visit. A PET scanner is a
      doughnut-shaped machine similar in appearance to a CT (computed tomography) scanner. PET
      scans detect radioactivity used to provide information on brain activity. Before the test
      begins, subjects are given a dose of carbidopa-a medicine that increases the amount of
      levodopa in the brain. A catheter (thin, plastic tube) is then inserted into an arm or wrist
      vein, and a radioactive form of levodopa called 18Fluorodopa is injected through the
      catheter. A moldable plastic mask with large openings for eyes, nose, and mouth is placed on
      the face to help keep the head still during scanning. The total scan time is 2 hours or
      less.

NCT00077896,Direct Current Brain Polarization in Frontotemporal Dementia,"
      This pilot study will evaluate the effect of direct current (DC) electrical polarization of
      the brain on language, memory, reaction time, and mood in six patients with frontotemporal
      dementia (Pick's disease). There is no effective treatment available for cognitive
      impairment in patients with this condition. DC polarization sends a very weak current
      between two sponge pads placed on the head. In a previous study in healthy volunteers, DC
      polarization of the left prefrontal area of the brain increased verbal fluency, memory and
      attention, and motor reaction time in the study subjects.

      Patients between 35 and 75 years of age with frontotemporal dementia who have been referred
      to NINDS's Cognitive Neuroscience Section for an existing protocol will be offered
      participation in this study. Candidates will be screened with a neurological examination to
      confirm the diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia.

      Participants receive 40 minutes of DC polarization or sham polarization in each of two
      separate sessions. (No current is applied in the sham treatment). During the polarization,
      the patient rests quietly. Sponge pads that have been soaked in water are put on the left
      side of the head and above the right eye, and are held in place with elastic netting. Before
      the polarization and after about 20 minutes of polarization, patients undergo the following
      tests:

        -  Language: Patients must say as many words beginning with certain letters as they can in
           90 seconds.

        -  Memory: Patients must remember a letter on a computer screen, and when the letter
           appears again, press the same letter on the keyboard.

        -  Reaction time: Patients place pegs on a pegboard.

        -  Mood: Patients place a mark on a line ranking how they feel.

NCT00340301,Exposure to Neurotoxins as Risk Factors for ALS,"
      Chemicals called neurotoxins can harm the nervous system. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
      (ALS) is a progressive disease affecting movement. Researchers have studied many possible
      causes of ALS, including injury, diet, and exposure to chemicals, but these studies were
      inconclusive.

      The purpose of this study was to determine whether exposure to lead or other neurotoxins can
      contribute to ALS. The study also evaluated lifestyle and dietary patterns. The study was
      completed in 1994-1996.

      One hundred eighty-two participants took part in this study 110 patients with ALS and 72 who
      did not have ALS. Each completed a questionnaire concerning lifestyle, diet, and
      residential, job, and medical history. Participants contributed 50 cc of blood, used to
      measure lead, as well as clippings of their toenails, used to measure mercury and other
      metals. They then underwent an XRF test (an X-ray procedure) to measure the level of lead in
      their shinbones and knees. Genes related to ALS or susceptibility to lead exposure were also
      evaluated.

      This study will test the ability of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to detect damage in
      different parts of the brain in patients with multiple sclerosis and to see if cognitive
      problems in patients can be correlated with the presence of lesions or reduction in the size
      of certain part of the brain. Healthy subjects will also be studied to compare findings in
      patients with those of normal volunteers.

      Healthy subjects and patients with multiple sclerosis who are between 18 and 60 years of age
      may be eligible for this study. Patients must not have severe clinical disability and must
      have been receiving and responding to Interferon beta for at least 6 months prior to
      enrollment. Candidates are screened with a medical history, physical examination, MRI and
      possibly evoked potential testing, which measures the nervous system response to visual,
      auditory and somatosensory stimulation.

      Participants have two MRI scans within 1 week (inclusive of the one performed for
      screening). MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to obtain images of body tissues and
      organs. The scanner is a metal cylinder surrounded by a strong magnetic field. During the
      MRI, the subject lies on a table that can slide in and out of the cylinder. Participants
      will be tested with magnet strengths of 1.5 and 3 Tesla; the higher the Tesla, the greater
      the ability to see brain changes. Each scan may last up to 90 minutes. In addition to the
      MRI scans, participants undergo cognitive testing that measures memory and thought processes
      and complete forms that test and quantify fatigue level, stress, anxiety and depression

NCT00439127,OnT4-Thyroglobulin Assay Before rhTSH-Aided Radioiodine Ablation,"
      Thyroidectomy followed by administration of large activities of 131-iodine (131I) is the
      treatment of choice for differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC). The serum thyroglobulin (Tg)
      measurement during hypothyroidism (offT4-Tg), just before radioiodine thyroid ablation, has
      proved to be effective for predicting persistent/recurrent disease. However, the Tg
      measurement cannot be used as a corresponding value for preablative offT4-Tg when rhTSH is
      used as stimulous before treatment. The present study was undertaken to evaluate if
      post-thyroidectomy Tg values, measured before rhTSH-stimulation and radioiodine
      administration, is of prognostic value in patients affected by DTC. We enrolled 28 patients
      with DTC and submitted to total thyroidectomy. Thyroxine (T4) treatment was started just
      after surgery to suppress TSH levels. Six to nine weeks later Tg levels were measured both
      basally (onT4-Tg) and after rhTSH (rhTSH-Tg) stimulation. Subsequently, T4 was stopped and
      serum Tg measured (offT4-Tg) just before 3700 MBq of 131I-iodide administration. A
      post-treatment whole body scan (PT-WBS) was performed and neck radioiodine uptake (RAIU)
      measured. A significant relationship was found between onT4-Tg and both rhTSH-Tg and
      offT4-Tg. The onT4-Tg levels of 0.2 ng/mL or higher predicted PT-WBS results with a 100%
      negative and 43% positive predictive values, respectively. Additionally onT4-Tg levels of
      0.9 ng/mL or more predicts 12-months recurrences with 100% negative and 60% positive
      predictive value. In comparison, 1.0 ng/mL or higher offT4-Tg values predicted PT-WBS
      results and 12-months restaging with 94% and 100% negative and 45% and 27% positive
      predictive value, respectively. Basing on our data we conclude that preablative onT4-Tg may
      be of value as prognostic marker when rhTSH-aided radioiodine ablation is done.
      Additionally, the role of preblative onT4-Tg measurement as a yard-stick for radioiodine
      ablation should be further evaluate.

NCT00474292,Influence of Area of Brain Damage on Brain Reorganization After Chronic Stroke,"
      This study will examine how the brain rewires itself to make up for the lack of movement
      many people with stroke experience. It will try to determine if the rewiring differs
      depending on the location of the stroke and the amount of time since the stroke occurred.
      For some stoke patients, weakness may persist, while others recover completely after time.
      It is not known which parts of the brain are involved in the recovery of different types of
      stroke and if the type of stroke affects recovery.

      People 18 years of age and older who have had subacute thromboembolic or hemorrhagic stroke
      more than 3 months before enrolling may participate in this study.

      Participants come to the NIH Clinical Center three times every 2 years for up to 10 years.
      At the first visit, patients have a neurological examination and perform tests of motor
      abilities such as lifting small objects, turning cards, using a spoon, stacking checkers and
      lifting cans during a short period of time as rapidly as possible.

      At the second visit, subjects have structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the
      brain. MRI uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to obtain images of body organs and
      tissues. The MRI scanner is a metal cylinder surrounded by a strong magnetic field. During
      the scan, the subject lies on a table that can slide in and out of the cylinder, wearing
      earplugs to muffle loud knocking noises associated with the scanning process. Total scan
      time is about 30 minutes

      At the third visit, subjects perform some simple movement tasks during functional MRI (fMRI)
      scans. The procedure is the same as with structural MRI, except that subjects are asked to
      perform simple movement tasks in the scanner. Before the fMRI scans, electrodes are attached
      to the subject's arms and legs to monitor muscle activity (surface electromyography). Total
      scan time is about 1.5 hours. Movement tasks might include pinching a force-measuring
      instrument with the fingers, pressing different keys on a keyboard as fast as possible,
      inserting pegs into small holes on a board, lifting weights, flipping cards or similar
      activities.

NCT00476372,Cognitive Impairment in Parkinson's Disease Categorised in Accordance to Motor Symptoms,"
      Background: Approximately 40% of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) have cognitive
      impairments. There is a lack of consensus as to the extent to which psychiatric symptoms,
      depression, age at disease onset, disease duration, and medication is related to the type
      and severity of cognitive impairment. This discrepancy can in part be caused by the lack of
      distinction between patients with different motor symptoms and disease severity.

      Objective: To identify the extent to which psychiatric symptoms, depression, age at disease
      onset, disease duration, and medication is related to the severity and type of cognitive
      dysfunction in patients with idiopathic PD categorized according to motor symptoms and
      disease severity.

      Methods: the population of patients with PD in the old county of Aarhus is described on the
      background of medical records, and stratified in accordance to age, sex and cardinal
      symptoms. Through proportional allocation a sample of a minimum of 50 patients with PD is
      drawn from the population. The patients and 30 healthy matched controls will undergo
      comprehensive neuropsychological assessment including tests of language, memory, executive
      function, and visuospatial function. Furthermore, all participants will be screened for
      depression (Geriatric Depression Scale) and psychiatric symptoms (Neuropsychiatric Inventory
      and Symptom Checklist). The patients will be categorized in accordance with their motor
      symptoms via cluster analysis for the purpose of analyzing the effect of psychiatric
      symptoms, depression, and age of disease onset, disease duration, and medication on

NCT00526084,Functional Pharmacogenomics of Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in Taiwan,"
      Emerging results suggest that a cure rate of nearly 90 percent will be attained in the near
      future. The advance was attributed to stringent application of prognostic factors for risk
      factor-directed therapy. Early response to treatment has greater prognostic strength than
      does any other biologic or clinical feature tested to dates. The measurement of minimal
      residual disease(MRD) affords a level of sensitivity and specificity that cannot be attained
      through traditional microscopic morphologic assessments. In Taiwan, detection for the most
      recurrent fusion genes and the MRD were not commonly available, the TPOG(Taiwan Pediatric
      Oncology Group) used clinical features, immunophenotypes, and cytogenetics to do risk group
      classifications and protocol assignment. A successful rate of 60-70% has been reached. In
      order to improve the cure rate of ALL in Taiwan, this project aims at establishing the
      methods for better risk classifications and establishing MRD detection for risk-directed
      therapy for childhood ALL in Taiwan.Intrinsic and acquired resistances to multiple
      anticancer agents represent major obstacles and accounts for 10-20% of treatment failure in
      the developed countries nowadays. Recent progress using DNA microarray identified
      differential expression level of the genes known to implicate in cell cycle control, DNA
      repair and apoptosis in different subsets of ALL patients, which were found to be related to
      drug response. Genetic polymorphisms in the genes of drug-metabolizing enzymes, drug
      transporters or drug targets, can influence the efficacy or toxicity of antileukemic agents.
      Specific genotype might be important in determining the pharmacokinetic effects of one
      population or disease subtype from that in others. Recently, the expression profiles of
      relatively few microRNAs (miRNAs) (~200 genes), was noted to accurately classify human
      cancers. These informations hinted that expression of the genes in the leukemic cells might
      serve as additional risk factors for treatment stratification.

      Specific aims and goals:

        1. to establish better risk factors classification and use MRD to monitor early response
           to treatment.

        2. to establish the expression profiles of 12 genes associated with drug resistance

      Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neuromuscular condition characterized
      by weakness, muscle wasting, fasciculations and increased reflexes. Depending on the site of
      onset, individuals with ALS progressively lose control of their skeletal muscles; bulbar or
      the extremities. As symptoms worsen and spread, muscle atrophy becomes apparent and upper
      motor neuron symptoms such as spasticity complicate gait (in lower limb involvement) and
      manual dexterity (in upper limb involvement). The patients progress to a state of profound
      disability and have great difficulty in communicating; some may even be entirely ""locked in""
      to their bodies. The capacity for simple communication could greatly improve their quality
      of life.

      New technologies are giving people with disabilities alternate communication and control
      options. One such instrument is the EEG-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) which can
      provide both communication and control functions to those who have lost muscle control. By
      recording electroencephalographic (EEG) signals or brain waves from the scalp and then
      decoding them, the Wadsworth BCI allows people to make selections on a computer screen [i]
      In this study we will be investigating the feasibility of using EEG-based Brain-Computer
      Interface technology as a communication solution for individuals with ALS. The specific
      question addressed will be: Can individuals with ALS use the BCI for communication when they
      present with extreme loss of neuromuscular control and severe communication impairments? The
      goal of the project is to determine whether this device is a practical and realistic means
      for individuals with ALS to communicate. The study is intended to evaluate both the
      complexity of the system and the degree to which each participant will be able to
      communicate. Trials will consist of asking the subject to follow a series of simple
      instructions and complete certain tasks while using the BCI.

NCT00812474,Regional Cortical Cerebral Quantitative MRI Perfusion Correlation Neurocognition in Multiple Sclerosis,"
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a common disease affecting 1/1000 Canadians. Cognition impairment
      is reported in 40-65% of patients and is socially and functionally disabling. Although
      multiple sclerosis is widely regarded as a white matter disease, cortical disease burden is
      increasingly emphasized. Studies confirm that gray matter (GM) disease is grossly
      underestimated by conventional MRI. Although the cause for MS is unknown vascular impairment
      is implicated in nerve cell death. Several studies have shown perfusion abnormalities in the
      central GM and white matter (WM) structure. Severity of perfusion reduction correlates with
      lesion load, atrophy, MS subtype and disease duration. Further extent of cortical atrophy
      correlates with neurocognitive impairment. We hypothesize that cortical perfusion is a
      marker of cortical disease severity and correlates with neurocognitive impairment. To show
      this we will measure regional cortical perfusion and regional brain and WM lesion volumes in
      26 predefined brain regions using a template developed for Alzheimer's disease. Regional
      perfusion will be correlated with neurocognitive tests validated for MS use. Patients will
      be divided into impaired and non impaired and perfusion compared controlling for known

      Atrophic vaginitis is a common problem that occurs in up to 40% of postmenopausal women. The
      main symptoms are dryness, itching and burning in and around the vagina. These symptoms in
      turn can cause pain with intercourse. Other symptoms can include urinary frequency and
      urinary urgency. These symptoms are caused by the decreasing levels of estrogens in

      The Fetid Rhinitis or Atrophic Ozena is a chronic illness characterized by yellowish
      secretion in the initial phase and the other phases with fetid crusts and atrophy of the
      mucous bone covering. Diverse theories exist that try to explain the appearance of this
      pathology, such as: hereditary factors, immunological alterations, viral infection and
      nutritional lack. Currently, its etiology remains unknown. As there isn't any ideal
      treatment already established, this technique improves the options of treatment.

      All patients have improved after the procedure.

NCT01050881,Notification of Donors With Positive Microbiology Markers,"
      Each year around 200 blood donors in the UK are found to be infected with blood-borne
      diseases (HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HTLV), while several others have been
      identified as having an increased risk of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD). Although
      the notification procedures for these infections vary, their effectiveness and
      appropriateness have never been evaluated in a systematic study.

      The proposed research has been designed to assess the responses of blood donors to
      notification and their satisfaction with how they were informed about the infection. The
      study will be implemented using standard questionnaire-based measures (French et al, 2004;
      Marteau & Bekker, 1992).

      The study will involve approximately 600 blood donors who were informed of an infection or
      possible infection with blood-borne diseases in 2008 and 2009, and approximately 100 donors
      notified of possible risk of vCJD infection in 2005. A comparable group of 2005 donors will
      be included to control for the effects of time. As the majority of donors testing positive
      donated to NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT), the participants will be identified from the
      NHSBT database only, and their availability confirmed through their GP or specialist
      clinician. A standardized questionnaire will be then sent to all those identified as
      eligible.

      The study will last 12 months, but direct participant involvement will be limited to the
      time required to complete the questionnaire, which should take under one hour. To safeguard
      confidentiality, no identifiable personal data will be used in the analysis. Where
      demographic or medical information already held by NHSBT is retrieved to minimise response
      burden, this will be pseudonymised before use.

      The study is sponsored by the blood services for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern
      Ireland. The results will be used to inform notification procedures in the future.

NCT01122342,Vaginal Testosterone Cream For Atrophic Vaginitis in Women Taking Aromatase Inhibitors for Breast Cancer.,"
      Atrophic vaginitis is a condition in which the skin lining of the vagina and labia becomes
      thin and symptoms develop including vaginal itching, vaginal discomfort and dyspareunia.
      These can significantly affect women's comfort, sexuality and quality of life.

      Treatment for this condition includes estrogen given in pill form, commonly known as hormone
      replacement therapy and local estrogen treatments, such as vaginal estrogen creams and
      topical vaginal lubricants. Unfortunately, systemic estrogen is contraindicated in many
      women with breast cancer. Some providers also feel that women who are taking aromatase
      inhibitors for their breast cancer should also not use local estrogens as several small
      studies suggest that these treatments might effect estrogen levels and thus might change how
      effective the aromatase inhibitors are. If these women choose not to use any form of
      estrogen therapy there symptoms may not be well controlled with other treatments.

      The investigators hypothesize that a vaginal testosterone cream might be a safe and
      effective alternative treatment for these women. This small study is intended to test the
      hypothesis that testosterone cream will not increase estrogen (estradiol) levels and that it
      will improve the symptoms of atrophic vaginitis including vaginal dryness, vaginal itching
      and pain with intercourse.

      The investigators will enroll women in the trial who are taking an aromatase inhibitor and
      have the symptoms mentioned above. They will receive a testosterone cream which will be
      applied vaginally once a day for 28 days. If good results are found with a prespecified dose
      of testosterone, a lower dose will be tested in the next group of women enrolled.

      Mild cognitive impairment, including difficulty with solving problems, planning, attention,

NCT01555827,Retinal Neurodegenerative Signs in Alzheimer's Diseases,"
      A few studies suggest that patients suffering from neurodegenerative diseases (such a
      multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's disease (AD)) show decreased thickness of the retinal
      nerve fiber layer (RNFL), indicating axonal degeneration. High-definition spectral domain
      optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), performed without radiation in a few seconds per eye,
      offers a precise and standardized estimation of this parameter, which could constitute a
      biomarker for cerebral axonal degeneration. These RNFL deficits might even be the earliest
      sign of AD, prior to damage of the hippocampal region that impacts memory.

      Besides, some associations of AD with some degenerative diseases of the eye (glaucoma,
      microvascular abnormalities, age-related macular degeneration (AMD)) have also been
      reported.

      It therefore seems interesting to determine whether RNFL thickness, and other ocular
      parameters, may give some indications for a better detection of AD and cognitive decline in

      countries.. Early and accurate diagnosis leading to earlier treatment and intervention is
      recognised as a major factor in determining a good outcomes. This study will investigate new
      ways of diagnosing thyroid cancer from blood samples using proteomic and genetic markers.
      The study will take samples from patients with differentiated thyroid cancer and measure
      relative quantities of 1000s of proteins within the blood. These measures will be explored
      to see if, when used in combination they can accurately diagnose thyroid cancer. If
      successful this technique could be extended to routine screening and could replace more
      invasive tests currently used. Participants will be required to supply a small sample of
      blood, answer questions on their medical history and also consent for their medical records

      The improvement of the healing rates for breast cancer is based to an important part on the
      consistent use of so-called adjuvant (""supporting "") medicamentous therapies, including
      chemotherapy. However this success has a price due to still inaccurate knowledge of the
      individual risk of relapse: a high number of unnecessary therapies are applied

NCT01641627,Preventive Effect of Proprioceptive Stimulation on Muscle Atrophy,"
      Confinement to bed, which occurs in many pathological situations, induces a muscle atrophy
      and a loss of muscle strength. Muscle atrophy is associated to impaired performance in motor
      tasks, such as posture and locomotion, and is therefore a major cause of loss of autonomy.
      It requires a stay in follow-up and rehabilitation service, and thus lengthens the duration
      of hospitalisation.

      Data underline the importance of afferent input integrity in the maintenance of muscle
      characteristics and postural control, and suggest that countermeasure programs based on the
      stimulation of proprioceptive inputs could be efficient to prevent muscle atrophy and falls.
      In particular, fundamental studies performed in rodents by the investigators laboratory have
      demonstrated that the adverse structural and functional adaptations which occur during
      muscle deconditioning can be counteracted through adequate physiological stimuli such as
      activation of proprioceptors. Based on this scientific expertise, the investigators aim is
      thus to prevent muscle atrophy and its functional consequences on posture and locomotion,
      following a surgical intervention in humans .

      The investigators will develop a device allowing stimulation of foot and ankle
      proprioceptors. In order to facilitate the evaluation of its efficiency, the device will be
      tested on a selected population confined to bed during a post-operative period (knee
      replacement). It efficiency will be evaluated by means of three parameters: muscle force of
      ankle plantar flexor, muscle volume of lower limb muscles, functional outcome (gait and
      balance analysis).

      The technique developed in the present project could bring benefits to patients confined to
      bed, or in elderly. Preventing or retarding development of muscle atrophy will beneficiate
      to health and quality of life of these patients. In addition, this device might allow to

NCT01677793,Developmental Trajectory of Brain Structural Connectivity and Cognitive Function From Childhood to Adulthood,"
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a premier modality to investigate structures and
      functions of human brain. In studies of children and adolescents, noninvasiveness of MRI
      makes it especially applicable. Developmental trajectory of gray matter volume and cortical
      thickness has been well studied in western countries. However, significant variability of
      brain structure has been reported between Chinese and Caucasian, and the variation may also
      exist in developmental trajectory of the brain. However, the maturation processes of neural
      fiber tracts in white matter are less understood. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), which has
      been frequently used to investigate the integrity of fibertracts in the literature, is
      limited in dealing with crossing fibers. Diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) is a newly
      developed technique to improve the resolution of crossing fibers, and it is more suitable
      for detailed tractography assessment. In addition to establishing the template of brain
      structure (T1 and T2) and structural connectivity of our child, adolescent, and young adult
      population, the study has the following three aims.

NCT02208219,Music Therapy to Restore Motor Deficits After Stroke,"
      Motor deficits are common after stroke, being one of the major causes of disability in this
      population. Because of the impact that motor impairments have in the life of patients and
      the associated financial costs, it is a health care priority to develop effective and
      efficient treatments to restore motor deficits. Music-supported therapy (MST) has been
      recently developed to enhance the use of the affected extremity after stroke.

      In the present project, a new multidisciplinary approach (neurology, neuropsychology, music
      and cognitive neurosciences) will be undertaken in order to investigate the effectiveness of
      MST as a neurorehabilitation technique to restore the motor function in stroke patients. In
      addition, the complex pattern of reorganization of the sensorimotor system will be studied
      in order to provide information about the physiological mechanisms underlying the
      neurorehabilitation process.

      A randomized controlled trial is proposed to compare for first time the effectiveness of MST
      (at the hospital and at home) compared to conventional treatment in subacute stroke patients
      suffering from motor deficits. Our hypothesis is that patients will experience a large
      improvement in the functional use of the affected arm due to the implementation of the MST
      program when compared to conventional treatment. We also expect to observe improvements in
      cognitive functions, mood and quality of life. Besides, we hypothesize that these
      amelioration in motor and cognitive domains will be accompanied by neuroplastic changes in
      the sensorimotor cortex and corticospinal tract.

NCT02544178,Study of Neurological Complication After Radiotherapy for High Grade Glioblastoma,"
      The survival time and the number of long time survivors after radiotherapy in brain cancer
      patients have increased for the last decades. Therefore the topic of late-delayed neurotoxic
      effects of this therapy gains more and more importance. Among these side effects, the main
      and most frequent one is the leukoencephalopathy, a diffused and progressive damage of the
      white matter characterized by myelin loss, loss of axons and vascular lesions. The incidence
      rate assessment, as well as the occurrence time, is based on retrospective studies with low
      numbers of patients, but seems to reach 30 to 50 % of the patients according to the
      follow-up. The risk seems to be increased during the first two years after the radiotherapy,
      but persists for decades.

      To gain further insight in the radiation-induced leukoencephalopathy, the objective of this
      project is to study the onset and evolution of leukoencephalopathy in a 3-year prospective
      cohort of patients having undergone cerebral radiotherapy for glioma (stage 3-4), using
      specific cognitive tests, Magnetic Resonance Imagery (MRI) scans of the brain and predictive

NCT02571504,Cognitive Training for the Remediation of Functional Brain Health in HIV,"
      Cognitive deficits in HIV reflect degraded brain network functioning that may be amenable to
      remediation through cognitive training. In this sub-study, we will make use of
      Plasticity-based Adaptive Cognitive Remediation (PACR), which applies well-understood
      techniques derived from brain plasticity and implicit/procedural/perceptual learning to
      improve the speed and accuracy of information processing, with exercises that are designed
      to drive generalized improvements. Simultaneously, these exercises heavily engage
      neuromodulatory systems to re-establish their normal control over learning and memory. As an
      individual restores these degraded abilities through intensive procedural learning, the
      encoding of naturalistic information significantly improves, and all resulting declarative
      memory and cognitive functions based on the quality of that incoming information necessarily
      improve as well, leading to improvement that generalizes beyond the trained tasks.

      A subset of 80 HIV+ individuals will undergo eight weeks of PACR to determine its
      feasibility and appropriateness for people with mild cognitive difficulties related to HIV
      infection. The results of this study are expected to be pivotal in generating data to create
      an optimal training program aimed at stabilizing or improving brain function in HIV infected
      individuals experiencing cognitive decline.

NCT02579278,Circulating Tumour DNA (ctDNA) Rectal Cancer and the Relationship to Extramural Venous Invasion,"
      In almost one third of patients with rectal cancer, cancer spreads through the bowel wall
      into nearby veins which can be seen on MRI scans and is known as mrEMVI. It has been
      observed that this is linked with worse survival due to the spread of cancer to the liver
      and other organs. The investigators think that this may occur by spread of cancer cells in
      the blood stream. Circulating cell-free tumour DNA (ctDNA) can be detected in the blood of
      patients with both metastatic and primary carcinoma (but not healthy individuals).

      This trial does not interfere with the patient's routine treatment pathway. Participants
      will be grouped into whether or not they demonstrate mrEMVI on their post-radiotherapy MRI
      scan. 20 patients who are mrEMVI positive and 20 patients who are mrEMVI negative will have
      blood samples taken pre-surgery and then again during surgery and a comparison will be made
      between the two groups. If the investigators can find a link between the cancer cells seen
      in blood to mrEMVI they may be able to use this test to help guide treatment in the future.
      This study will serve as the feasibility of a larger, comparative study.

NCT02588053,Does Long-Term Natalizumab (NTZ) Therapy Normalize Brain Atrophy Rates and Quality of Life (QOL) in Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS)?,"
      Primary Aims: To determine how effective long term Natalizumab (NTZ) therapy is in slowing
      the progression of whole brain atrophy. Whole brain atrophy rates will be measured through
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and compared between patients with Multiple Sclerosis
      (MS) who have been using NTZ for at least 2 years versus age and gender-matched healthy
      controls. The primary outcome will be whole brain atrophy rate measured as the percent
      change in brain volume (PBVC) over a two-year period.

      Primary hypothesis:

      The investigators hypothesize that long term (>2 years) NTZ therapy will slow the rate of
      whole brain atrophy in patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) (as measured by percent change
      in brain volume), reaching a whole brain atrophy rate similar to that of non-MS controls (a

NCT02604186,Effects of Botulinum Toxin Injections in Patients With Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia,"
      Hereditary spastic paraplegias constitute a heterogeneous group of diseases with the common
      predominant feature of spasticity of the lower limbs. The clinical picture is composed of
      difficulty walking, exaggerated deep reflexes, pathological reflexes such as the Babinski
      sign, sphincter disturbances and various degrees of weakness as well as sensory
      disturbances.

      Spasticity is the symptom that provoques greater incapacity. Although there have been recent
      advances in the genetic and pathogenic characterization of SPG there is scarcity of
      therapeutic options. The Botulinum Toxin (BTx) is a well established treatment for movement
      disorders such as cervical dystonia, blepharospasm, and arm spastic following stroke.

      Therefore, the investigators propose the execution of a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, crossover study to evaluate the efficacy of the treatment with Btx over
      SPG patient's gait. The primary outcome measure will be gait velocity with the 10 meter
      walking test 8 weeks after injection. Each participant will be submitted to one injection
      session of Btx and one of placebo (consisting of sterile sodium chloride), each one
      separated by a period of 6 months. The primary and secondary outcomes will be evaluated by a
      blind investigator 8 weeks after each injection session.

NCT00124163,Evaluation of Stool Tagging for Improved Patient Compliance,"
      Computed tomography (CT) colonography has gained widespread multi-disciplinary interest as
      an evolving noninvasive colorectal screening examination, with the potential of improved
      patient compliance. The investigator's prior work demonstrated that the bowel preparation
      was the least tolerable aspect of colorectal evaluation when compared to the CT colonography
      and optical colonoscopy procedures. Stool tagging could provide a more gentle and efficient
      bowel preparation, with fewer false positives due to retained stool-mimicking polyps.

      The researchers hypothesize that image quality and patient preference will vary with stool
      tagging concentration and dosing schedule. The researchers propose to evaluate specific
      stool tagging protocols with the following aims:

      AIM 1: Perform a randomized trial of three specific stool tagging protocols using barium and
      iodine at CT colonography in a well-characterized cohort of patients undergoing colorectal
      evaluation.

      AIM 2: Analyze the CT colonography and optical colonoscopy data to assess differences across
      stool tagging protocols for the outcome measures of patient preference, image quality in the
      presence of tagging, and diagnostic reader performance.

      The researchers will use specific variations in stool tagging techniques to determine the
      best image quality of CT data (e.g., homogenous tagging of fluid and stool), and highest
      patient acceptability, as well as evaluate the adequacy of preparation for same-day
      colonoscopy. Diagnostic reader performance will focus on the accuracy for detecting all
      neoplastic lesions including colon cancers, adenomatous polyps, sessile adenomas and flat
      adenomas. Most importantly, these results will help inform the design of a larger trial of
      an optimized CT colonography technique in a community setting.

      We are approaching you to participate in this study because you are taking Palifermin and
      the purpose of this study is to describe the effect of Palifermin on skin growth found on
      the body. Palifermin is a new synthetic growth factor (encourages skin cells to grow)
      specifically designed to protect the areas of the body (mouth and upper digestive tract)
      that are damaged by chemotherapy. The cells in these areas are rapidly dividing cells and so
      are killed by chemotherapeutic drugs. Palifermin is a drug that stimulates new cells in
      these areas to grow and therefore protects patients from some serious side effects of
      chemotherapy. These include mucositis or inflammation of the lining of the mouth and other
      organs resulting in difficulty swallowing, speaking and extreme pain in the mouth and upper
      digestive tract.

      Skin cells are also known to respond to these types of growth factors like Palifermin, but
      unfortunately no studies have been done that look specifically at the effect of this drug on
      pre-existing skin lesions or the development of new skin lesions. We will be asking you if
      you have noticed any change in moles or other skin lesions that you have, and if you have
      noticed any new lesions. We will also be doing a full physical examination of the skin at

NCT00684294,Phase I Trial of TGFB2-Antisense-GMCSF Gene Modified Autologous Tumor Cell (TAG) Vaccine for Advanced Cancer,"
      Preliminary studies with a variety of vaccines suggest target accessibility (potential
      immunogenicity) in a variety of solid tumors to immune directed approaches. However, four
      primary factors limit the generation of effective immune mediated anticancer activity in
      therapeutic application:

        1. identifying and/or targeting cancer associated immunogen(s) in an individual patient

        2. insufficient or inhibited level of antigen presenting cell priming and/or presentation

        3. suboptimal T cell activation and proliferation

        4. cancer-induced inhibition of the anticancer immune response in both afferent and
           efferent limbs.

      In an effort to overcome these limitations, we have designed a novel autologous vaccine to
      address inability to fully identify cancer associated antigens, antigen recognition by the
      immune system (i.e. antigen to immunogen), effector potency, and cancer-induced resistance.
      We have completed clinical investigations using two different gene vaccine approaches to
      induce enhancement of tumor antigen recognition which have demonstrated therapeutic
      efficacy. Specifically, both the use of a GMCSF gene transduced vaccine and a TGFβ2
      antisense gene vaccine, in separate trials, have demonstrated similar beneficial effects
      without any evidence of significant toxicity in advanced cancer patients. The GMCSF
      transgene directly stimulates increased expression of tumor antigen(s) and enhances
      dendritic cell migration to the vaccination site. TGFβ2 blockade following intracellular
      TGFβ2 antisense gene expression reduces production of immune inhibiting activity at the
      vaccine site. These agents have never been used in combination but the rationale of
      integrating enhancement of an anticancer immune response concurrently with a reduction in
      cancer-induced immune suppression is conceptually sound. We will harvest autologous cancer
      cells from patients with advanced refractory cancer. We have constructed a TGFβ2 antisense /
      GMCSF expression vector plasmid and have successfully demonstrated preclinical activity of
      the vector function following transfection by electroporation and irradiation of autologous

      Objective: Recent non-randomized studies suggest that extended endoscopic submucosal
      dissection (ESD) is equally effective in removing large rectal adenomas as transanal
      endoscopic microsurgery (TEM). If equally effective, ESD might be a more cost-effective
      approach as this strategy does not require expensive equipment, general anesthesia and
      hospital admission. Furthermore, ESD appears to be associated with fewer complications. In a
      randomized trial we will compare the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of TEM and ESD for
      the resection of large rectal adenomas.

      Study design: 15 centers will participate in this multicenter randomized trial comparing TEM
      versus ESD.

      Study population: Patients with a large rectal adenoma (≥2cm), located between 2 and 15 cm
      from the anal verge. Invasive cancer is excluded by histopathology and endoscopic
      ultrasonography. Patients must be in a health condition that permits general anesthesia.

      Interventions: Patients will be randomized between

      a. TEM: under general anesthesia b. ESD under sedation

        1. a TEM tube will be inserted in the rectum. With specialized instruments the adenoma
           will be dissected en bloc by a full thickness excision, after which the patient will be
           admitted to the hospital.

        2. an endoscope will be inserted into the rectum and the submucosa underneath the lesion
           will be injected with saline to lift the adenoma. With an endoscopic knife (Insulated
           Tip Knife, Olympus or Water Jet, Erbe) the lesion will be resected through the
           submucosal plane in an eb-bloc fashion, after which the patient will be observed for at
           least 24h in-hospital.

      Primary Endpoint: incidence of recurrence at 12 months

      Secondary Endpoints:

      morbidity, subdivided into major (requiring surgery) and minor (requiring endoscopic or
      medical intervention) anorectal function. disease specific and general quality of life;
      number of days not spent in hospital from initial treatment until 2 years afterwards;
      adenoma

      Sample size: Assuming a comparable baseline recurrence rate for TEM and ESD of 6% and
      considering an upper limit of 10% for ESD to be non-inferior (beta-error 0.2 and one-sided
      alpha-error 0.05), 60 patients are needed per group. These numbers provide sufficient power
      to reveal relevant differences in expected morbidity and in number of days not spent in
      hospital.

      Economic evaluation: A cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis of ESD against TEM for
      large rectal adenomas from a societal perspective with respectively the costs per recurrence
      free patient and the cost per quality adjusted life year as primary outcome measures.

      Infantile Hemangioma (IH) is infancy's most common vascular tumor of infancy and most
      frequent benign neoplasm.

      Treatment of IHs is indicated for approximately 10 to 20% of the cases. Two groups can be
      defined amongst indications for treatment: patients with absolute indication for treatment
      and patients with relative indication for treatment.

      Absolute or emergency indications comprise function or life threatening situations such as
      obstruction of airways, obstruction of vision, congestive heart failure, hepatic and
      coagulation problems.

      The following are considered relative indications: cases of large and disfiguring facial
      hemangiomas; locations that can result in a deformity and/ or permanent scar (nose, ear,
      lip, glabellar area); extensive face hemangiomas, mainly when there is dermal damage (more
      probable to scar); local complications such as ulceration, infection and bleeding as well as
      small hemangiomas in exposed areas (hands and face), mainly if pedunculated due to its ease
      of excision2,7.

      Treatment modalities vary according to the extension, location, presence of complications
      and the evolutional phase. A combination of various treatments is possible.

      Beta blockers are being used in children for approximately 40 years, with proven clinical
      safety and no cases of death or cardiovascular disease resulting from its direct use.
      Recently it was reported the use of beta blockers (propanolol) for IH treatment, with
      significant reduction of tumor volume after introduction of the beta blocker, in a short
      period of time, with stable results after the end of treatment, which suggested evidences of
      the benefits of this drug in the tumor treatment The proposal of this study is to assess the
      use of propanolol in IH treatment, quantifying its effectiveness and safety under continuous
      monitoring and comparing it to the use of oral corticosteroid. The investigators propose the
      assessment of the betablockers' use in comparison to the use of corticosteroids in infants
      with IH in the proliferative or involuting phases, with indication for clinical treatment,
      and that are not alarming nor urgent; in other words, the current relative indications for

NCT01405755,Partnering With Media and Vaccination Program to Improve Infant and Young Child Feeding,"
      Infant and young child feeding (IYCF) is a key determinant of under-nutrition and overweight
      in young children. In Mexico, breastfeeding extends well into the second half of infancy,
      but animal-source foods, cereals, and legumes are not regularly provided to the child by 9
      mo. This study evaluates whether knowledge and practices about dietary diversity and food
      consistency can be improved using a two-component intervention strategy in semi-urban
      communities in Mexico. The two components will deliver appropriate complementary feeding
      messages using: (a) nurses during the 1st National Vaccination Week (NVW); and (b) radio
      messages and interviews. The intervention is evaluated using a cluster randomized design in
      small semi-urban communities in two states in Mexico with pre- and post-test questionnaires
      designed to assess changes in feeding behaviors.

NCT01406379,Comparison of Prophylactic Clip and Detachable Snare,"
      Although endoscopic colonic polypectomy has been an established procedure for two decades,
      the risk of bleeding is still higher after resecting of pedunculated polyps, because of the
      presence of a large artery in the stalk. Several preventive methods such as detachable snare
      and adrenaline injection have been proposed in the management of postpolypectomy bleeding in
      large colonic polyps. For prophylactic clip, there was no prospective randomized study
      assessing the efficacy in the prevention of postpolypectomy bleeding for the large
      pedunculated polyps. So we designed a prospective, randomized study to compares the efficacy
      of application of prophylactic clip and detachable snare in the prevention of
      postpolypectomy bleeding in large polyps. Application of prophylactic clip will be as
      effective and safe method as detachable snare in the prevention of postpolypectomy bleeding
      for the large pedunculated colonic polyps.

NCT01444989,Development and Validation of a Quality of Life Instrument for Actinic Keratosis,"
      Actinic keratoses (AKs) are some of the most common lesions seen by dermatologists. Flesh
      colored to erythematous, these lesions often present with scaling or crusting in sun damaged
      regions of the body. While they are physically visible and often palpable, these changes can
      also result in psychosocial changes in patients, including embarrassment about their skin or
      reduction in leisure activities to avoid further sun exposure. At the same time, AKs are
      known to progress in a significant number of cases to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a
      concern in terms of its metastatic potential.

      The primary purpose of developing this questionnaire is to examine how well it can
      potentially identify patients with actinic keratoses. However, since AK is associated with
      significant detriment to quality of life for validity/reliability assessment, the
      investigators propose to give a compilation of four self-assessment questionnaires (not
      specific to AK but validated for skin health in general) to subjects with at least one
      actinic keratosis and age- and sex- matched participants without AKs, defined as the control
      population. These will include the SKINDEX-16, the DLQI and the Skin Health Calculator, as
      well as a questionnaire composed of items specific to predisposition to AKs to be able to

NCT01680562,In-vivo Optical Coherence Tomography Imaging in Dermatooncology,"
      In vivo differentiation of benign and malignant skin lesions is a fundamental issue in
      clinical dermatology. Malignant skin diseases are known to be accompanied by structural
      alterations. Conventional excisional biopsies and further histopathology are regarded as the
      reference standard for investigating these pathologies. Biopsies are invasive procedures and
      additionally may cause side effects. Therefore, research efforts are focused on the
      development of diagnostic techniques capable of providing in vivo information on the skin's
      structure. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a technical application, which allows the
      identification of microscopic patterns indicative for benign and malignant skin lesions. OCT
      is a promising noninvasive imaging technique for the micromorphology of the skin. So far,
      it's clinical application, as an additional diagnostic tool for malignant skin lesions has
      been studied in a limited extend. To evaluate the clinical usefulness of OCT, we conducted a
      prospective pilot study at the Department of Dermatology, Medical University of Vienna. The
      study is in cooperation with the Center of Biomedical Engineering and Physics at the Medical
      University of Vienna.

      A total of 70 malignant skin lesions was evaluated during this prospective pilot study.
      Diagnoses based on OCT imaging as an additional diagnostic tool, were compared to those
      based on the clinical standard pathway at the Department of Dermatology, Medical University
      of Vienna. For the purpose of this study, the histopathological diagnosis was used as the
      reference diagnostic standard.

      The major aims of this study is the investigation of the ability of ultrahigh resolution OCT
      to identify fine morphological characteristics associated with basal cell carcinoma, actinic
      keratosis, superficial squamous cell carcinoma, seborrheic keratosis, melanocytic nevi and

      External Genital Warts (EGW) are the most common sexually transmitted disease associated

      method of EGW treatment. However, multiple sessions may be required with reported clearance
      rates ranging between 27-88%. Sinecatechins 15% ointment is Food and Drug Administration
      approved for three times daily application in immunocompetent subjects 18 years and older
      for the treatment of EGW and perianal warts. Treatment of EGW with cryotherapy followed by
      sinecatechins appears to be logical. Cryotherapy has direct cytodestructive effects with
      immediate short-term efficacy on treated EGW, while sinecatechins provide field therapy,
      treating both clinical and sub-clinical lesions. For this study, the investigators used
      sinecatechins 15% ointment twice daily regimen and anticipated that the synergistic effect
      with cryotherapy will provide better efficacy that cryotherapy alone. The investigators also

NCT02220127,RCT of the 4mm vs. the 8mm Collimator for GKR of Brain Micrometastases,"
      Gamma Knife Radiosurgery (GKR) is a well-established treatment modality for brain metastasis
      (Chiou 2013; Salvetti, Nagaraja et al. 2013). Large multicentre series have been published
      on patients with single and multiple cerebral metastases, treated with GKR over a period of
      30 years (Karlsson, Hanssens et al. 2009). Multiple institutions have reported a
      consistently high local tumour control rate of 80%-90% following GKR (Chang, Lee et al.
      2000; Da Silva, Nagayama et al. 2009; Salvetti, Nagaraja et al. 2013).

      There is controversy over the use of GKR and/or Whole Brain Radiotherapy (WBRT) in patients
      with multiple metastases. WBRT provides a lower rate of distant recurrences, whereas GKR
      achieves good local control of treated lesions without the deleterious side effects of
      radiotherapy (Lippitz, Lindquist et al. 2014). This discussion is mainly focused on the risk
      of distant recurrences, which is lower if WBRT is given. There is evidence showing that
      Radiosurgery (RS) based on high contrast/resolution stereotactic MRI decreases the incidence
      and lengthens the time to distant recurrences (Hanssens, Karlsson et al. 2011). As a result,
      the current tendency is to treat all the lesions visible in high contrast/resolution images
      the day of Gamma Knife; which is followed by regular MRI follow ups and subsequent GKR for
      distant recurrences in order to avoid/delay WBRT.

      It has been estimated that more than a half of distant recurrences will grow from tumour
      cells that were already in the brain (as micrometastases) when radiosurgery is delivered,
      but not much has been studied on the optimal prescription and radiation delivery method for
      these lesions. There is controversy over which collimator should be used when treating
      micro-metastases (BmM). These lesions can either be treated with the 4mm collimator at an
      isodose between the 40% and 90%, or the 8mm collimator at an isodose above 90%. The 8 mm
      collimator is thought to offer better Local Control Rate (LCR) with the advantage of faster
      delivered treatments, while the 4 mm collimator is considered to be safer, given its steep
      dose fall-off. It is the aim of this study to find out which of the 4 mm or 8 mm collimators
      can achieve the higher LCR with less complications. A large number of lesions will be
      randomised to either the 4 or the 8 mm collimator and the patients followed up to evaluate
      clinical efficacy.

NCT00316017,Hypertonic Resuscitation Following Traumatic Injury,"
      The purpose of this study is to determine if hypertonic saline with and without dextran can
      improve overall survival in victims of trauma with shock.

      Injury and lost blood from trauma can cause your body to be in shock (low blood pressure
      related to blood loss). This decreased blood flow can lead to organ damage. In order to
      restore the blood pressure and blood flow, the medics give fluids into the patients' veins
      as soon as possible. This is called ""resuscitation."" The resuscitation fluid most commonly
      used is ""isotonic"" or one that is the same concentration as the blood. The investigators are
      trying to determine if infusing a ""hypertonic"" fluid (or one more concentrated than the
      blood) can increase the blood pressure and restore blood flow more efficiently. The
      hypertonic fluids the investigators are using are called hypertonic saline with dextran
      (HSD) and hypertonic saline (no dextran). Hypertonic saline is a salt solution that is
      slightly more concentrated than your blood. Dextran is a sugar solution.

      A common late complication after gastric bypass surgery is marginal ulceration that is
      defined as ulcers at the margins of the gastrojejunostomy, mostly on the jejunal side. Most
      marginal ulcers respond to medical therapy and complicated or complex ulcer disease warrants
      operative intervention; specifically, perforated, penetrated, obstructing, bleeding and
      intractable marginal ulcers require surgical intervention.

      Diverse operative strategies for addressing perforated marginal ulcers after gastric bypass
      have been described including I) Omental (Graham) patch repair, II) Revision of
      gastrojejunostomy, III) Irrigation and drainage, IV) any previous procedure with truncal

      This study is being done to see if a new approach to repair perforated ulcers in the stomach
      (holes in the stomach) or the first part of the intestine is possible. Traditionally, either
      open operations (large single incision) or laparoscopic operations (multiple small
      camera-guided incisions) have been used to repair perforated ulcers. Over the last ten
      years, some surgeons have used endoscopic equipment to assist them with performing the
      procedure. It is unknown if perforated ulcer repair can be done using an endoscope as the
      main instrument (a flexible tube with a video camera inserted into the stomach through your
      esophagus) to ""patch"" or plug the perforation. We will patch the perforation using a
      standard method which uses tissue from outside the stomach. A laparoscopic camera will also
      be used to assist our view. This study is intended to be a feasibility study to demonstrate
      the endoscopic technique can be safely performed

      The investigators previously showed that the use of a high-dose intravenous PPI regimen
      after endoscopic control of bleeding from peptic ulcers reduced rate of recurrent bleeding,
      decreased the need for endoscopic and surgical interventions and in general improved
      patients' outcomes. A trend towards reduced mortality associated with the use of high-dose
      intravenous PPI was also observed. Recent clinical trials from Asia have provided evidence
      that high-dose oral PPIs are associated with a reduction in rebleeding. Current
      meta-analysis suggests that both high dose (intravenous) and low dose (oral) PPIs
      effectively reduce rebleeding vs placebo. However, there has been no clinical study to

      Peptic ulcer bleeding associated with ASA or NSAIDs is a major cause of hospitalization in
      Hong Kong. The investigators previously showed that ASA or NSAIDs accounted for about half
      of all cases of hospitalizations for peptic ulcer bleeding. Currently, ASA use has
      contributed to about one-third of the bleeding ulcers admitted to the investigators hospital
      that serves a local population of 1.5 million.

      In patients with acute coronary syndrome or acute ischemic stroke who develop ASA-induced
      bleeding peptic ulcers, whether ASA should be discontinued before ulcers have healed is a
      major dilemma. In another double-blind randomized trial, the investigators have shown that
      discontinuation of ASA after endoscopic treatment of bleeding ulcers was associated with a
      significantly increased in mortality within 8 weeks.

      In the absence of safer aspirins, co-therapy with a gastroprotective drug remains the
      dominant preventive strategy. Given the vast number of people taking ASA, however, it is
      only cost-effective to identify and treat those who are at high risk of ulcer bleeding and
      who have a strong indication for ASA use. Data from observational studies and randomized
      trials have consistently shown that PPIs are effective in reducing the risk of ulcer
      bleeding associated with ASA. Other potential preventive strategies include eradication of
      H. pylori infection, substitution of ASA for other non-aspirin anti-platelet drugs, and

      The most common toxicity of chemotherapy is nausea and vomiting, and appropriate management
      of these toxicities can help patients improve tolerance for chemotherapy. Anti-emetics
      including dopamine antagonist, serotonin antagonist, and substance P antagonist administered
      to patients according to emetogenic risk of chemotherapeutic drugs. However, patients don't
      always experience same nausea and vomiting for the same drugs. Therefore, it is important to
      determine the biomarker to predict chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Some biomarkers
      studies were done during the chemotherapy. However it is not definite evidence of relations
      between biomarkers and chemotherapy. We will hope to find any predictive biomarker of CINV.

NCT02088385,Hemospray Versus the Combined Conventional Technique for Endoscopic Hemostasis of Bleeding Peptic Ulcers : A Pilot Study,"
      Hemospray (TC-325, Cook Medical Inc, Winston-Salem, NC, USA), a new adsorptive nanopowder
      hemostatic agent for endoscopic treatment of high-risk bleeding peptic ulcers, provides
      significant ease of administration compared to the combined conventional technique of
      saline-adrenaline injection with mechanical clip or heater probe applications. The Hemospray
      powder is easily applied on ulcers at difficult endoscopic positions and ulcers with
      fibrotic bases, where the combined conventional technique has limited efficacy. Building up
      on preliminary work from small single-arm studies, the investigators aim to establish the
      efficacy and safety of Hemospray in treating bleeding peptic ulcers in comparison with the
      combined conventional technique. The investigators propose a pilot study to establish our
      centre's feasibility of performing a prospective, randomized, parallel group trial, which
      compares the efficacy of Hemospray with the combined conventional technique, in the
      endoscopic treatment of high-risk bleeding peptic ulcers. Patients with high-risk bleeding
      peptic ulcers will be treated with Hemospray to determine its initial hemostasis rate
      (defined as endoscopically verified cessation of bleeding for at least 5 minutes after
      endoscopic treatment), rebleeding rate (recurrent hemorrhage during a 4-week period

NCT02150941,Effectiveness Study of the BioVac Direct Suction Device in Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding,"
      Upper endoscopy is performed for upper gastrointestinal bleeding (bleeding in the esophagus,
      stomach, or part of the duodenum) to identify and potentially treat the cause of bleeding.
      However, blood clots often make visualization difficult during endoscopy. The current
      practice is to try to wash off and suction up these blood clots with the endoscope. However,
      this is often not successful due to blood clots blocking the suction channel.

      A new device has been approved by Health Canada that attaches to the endoscope and helps
      prevent blockage. It is believed that this device will help doctors suck out blood clots and
      potentially improve visualization, identification of the cause of bleeding, and possibly
      health outcomes, although this has never been proven. The purpose of the this clinical trial
      is to test whether the device works and whether it can help patients with this type of
      bleeding.

      Background:

      A second endoscopic method added to injection therapy is recommended for high-risk bleeding
      peptic ulcers. Many endoscopic devices have been proved as useful hemostatic instruments,
      whereas the hemostatic efficacy of argon plasma coagulation (APC) has not been widely

      Aim:

      This study was designed to know whether additional APC treatment could influence the
      hemostatic efficacy after endoscopic injection therapy in treating high-risk bleeding
      ulcers.

      Methods:

      From October 2010 to January 2012, eligible patients who had high-risk bleeding ulcers were
      admitted to our hospital. They prospectively randomly underwent either APC therapy plus
      distilled water injection or distilled water injection alone. Pantoprazole infusion was
      conducted during the fasting period after endoscopy and orally for 8 weeks to encourage
      ulcer healing. Episodes of rebleeding were retreated with endoscopic combination therapy.
      Patients who did not benefit from retreatment underwent emergency surgery or transarterial

NCT02316990,China Survey of Stress Ulcer Bleeding in Critically Ill Neurosurgical Patients,"
      Stress ulcers or stress-related mucosal disease (SRMD) is defined as ""acute superficial
      inflammation lesions of the gastric mucosa induced when an individual is subject to
      abnormally elevated physiologic demands.""[1] Studies have shown that SRMD occurred in
      75%-100% ICU patients[1]. Gastrointestinal bleeding due to SRMD is an important complication
      in critically ill patients. The frequency of clinically important bleeding ranged from 5.3%
      to 33%.[2] The mortality in ICU patients with stress related bleeding approaches 50%, which
      is much higher than the patients without bleeding (9%). [3] In 1999, the American Society of
      Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) published guidelines on the use of stress ulcer prophylaxis
      in medical, surgical, respiratory, and pediatric ICU patients [2]. PPIs and H2RA are widely
      used in China current clinical practice for the prevention of stress ulcer bleeding.
      However, there is no epidemiology data to show the risk factors for stress ulcer bleeding
      and the bleeding rate of Chinese neurosurgical critically ill patients who are usually
      suffering from brain trauma, cerebral haemorrhage or brain tumour operation. Information is
      needed to know about the characteristics in Chinese critically ill neurosurgical patients.

      Objectives of this Non-Interventional Study Primary

        1. Primary objective: To estimate the overall incidence of upper gastrointestinal (GI)
           bleeding in critically ill neurosurgical patients in China.

        2. Main secondary objective

             -  To estimate the incidence of upper GI bleeding with clinically significant
                complications in critically ill neurosurgical patients in China.

             -  To estimate the incidence of any overt upper GI bleeding without clinically
                significant complications in critically ill neurosurgical patients in China.

             -  To assess time to upper GI bleeding after a cerebral lesion.

             -  To investigate potential risk factors associated with upper GI bleeding, and
                assess how common certain risk factors occurred in upper GI bleeding patients.

             -  To assess the overall incidence of upper GI bleeding in critically ill patients by
                different risk factors for upper GI bleeding.

NCT02352155,Second-look Endoscopy in High Risk Patients After Endoscopic Hemostasis to Their Bleeding Peptic Ulcers Improves Their Outcomes,"
      Bleeding peptic ulcer is a common medical emergency. Endoscopic treatment stops bleeding in
      those actively bleeding from their peptic ulcers, reduces further bleeding, transfusion,
      surgery and deaths. After initial endoscopic control of bleeding, approximately 10% of them
      will develop recurrent bleeding. Mortality rate in this group of patients is at least 4 fold
      higher. In the few who need surgery, mortality approaches 30%. Prevention of further
      bleeding is therefore a major treatment objective. Currently the investigators use a high
      dose infusion of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for 72 hours to render gastric pH neutral. In a
      previous randomized trial, the investigators showed that the rate of bleeding in 30 days was
      around 7% with such an approach. In a small subgroup of high risk patients defined by
      presentation with shock and ulcers > 2 cm in size, 1 in 6 would re-bleed. An alternate
      strategy is to select those at especially high risk of further bleeding and repeat
      endoscopic treatment the next morning. The investigators have shown that persistence of
      major bleeding stigmata, i.e. a visible vessel, during a second endoscopy predicts further
      bleeding. It is therefore logical that by repeating endoscopic treatment the next morning,
      the investigators can prevent further bleeding and possibly surgery and deaths. The current
      study proposes to develop a score to identify those at risk of further bleeding after
      endoscopy. The investigators used a historical cohort with carefully collected clinical data
      to derive a risk score. In this derivation phase of 939 patients, the investigators have
      developed a 9 point risk score which consists of the following parameters (Age>60, Male sex,
      ulcer>2cm, posterior bulbar in location, spurting or Forrest Ia bleeding and admission
      hemoglobin of < 8 g/dl). Using AUROC and Youden J statistics, a score of 5 or above has been
      shown to highly predictive of further bleeding. The score will then be validated in a
      prospective cohort of patients with bleeding peptic ulcers. In the final phase of this
      study, the investigators propose a randomized controlled trial to test the hypothesis that a
      second look endoscopy with treatment in selected high risk patients can further reduce
      bleeding and improve their outcomes. After endoscopic hemostasis to their bleeding peptic
      ulcers, patients are risk stratified based on the score. Those with a score of 5 or more are
      randomized to receive the standard treatment (a high dose PPI infusion) or a second look
      endoscopy with treatment in addition to PPI infusion. The primary outcome to the trial is
      further significant clinical bleeding.

        -  Hospital admission can be avoided if serious UGIB can be excluded

        -  To date, the only useful tool to triage patient for hospital admission in UGIB is by
           using clinical score such as Rockall score or Blatchford score

        -  These scores are cumbersome and only exclude the most benign cases, but they are not
           useful in differentiating those who needs intervention

        -  In our pilot study, investigators found that capsule endoscopy can be used to identify
           patients with fresh blood and real coffee ground substance in the stomach and it is
           superior to nasogastric tube

        -  Most of UGI lesions leading to bleeding can be diagnosed by capsule endoscopy

      Objectives The current study is designed

        1. to validate capsule endoscopy is an effective method in identifying patients with UGIB

        2. to study whether the capsule endoscopy can reduce requirement of hospital admission in

      Background and Rationale for Study: Estrogen and progesterone are female hormones that
      regulate the menstrual cycle and likely serve an important role in the regulation of mood.
      Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS) which affects 75% of healthy women is a cyclic pattern of mild
      dysphoria and physical discomfort that begin 1-2weeks pre-menses, and resolve by 2-3 days
      post-onset of menses. Up to 66% of women with bipolar disorder (BD) describe premenstrual
      mood changes that range from mild symptoms to severe worsening that require hospitalization.
      Therefore, the hormonal shifts of the menstrual cycle likely influence bipolar symptoms, but
      confirmatory research is lacking.

      Study questions: The primary aims and hypotheses are to characterize bipolar mood symptoms
      throughout the menstrual cycle and to determine if women with BD have: 1) a) increased
      severity and persistence of depression and mania symptoms in the late luteal (premenstrual)
      vs early follicular phase, b) larger change in mood symptoms from the late luteal
      (premenstrual) to the early follicular phase, compared to healthy women, 2) more relapses,
      in the late luteal compared to the early follicular phase. The secondary aims are to
      determine: 1) frequency and severity of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) type symptoms
      in bipolar women; 2) association between bipolar mood variability and a) menstrual phase, b)
      ovulatory vs anovulatory cycles, c) antimanic drug treatment.

      This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of methylphenidate in treating

      Trichotillomania is an impulse control disorder. There is growing evidences of the
      involvement of dopaminergic neurotransmission in the pathophysiology of trichotillomania.
      Reported increase in the prevalence of ADHD among patients with impulse control disorders,
      such as pathological gambling as well as trichotillomania, may result from the overlapping

NCT00849173,Global Study of Women's Health,"
      Endometriosis, a condition in which the lining of the uterus grows on nearby tissues, is a
      common condition that affects women of reproductive age worldwide. The diagnosis of
      endometriosis is usually made at surgery. The most common symptom is pelvic pain. This pain
      may occur at the same time as menstrual bleeding, at other times of the cycle, or during or
      after sexual intercourse. Previous studies reveal the diagnosis of endometriosis is often
      delayed between 8 and 12 years after the first symptoms. Women with chronic pelvic pain
      report a lower quality of life. No studies, however, have been conducted to assess whether
      women with endometriosis-related pelvic pain are affected differently than those with pelvic
      pain from other or no identifiable causes.

      This large-scale study is designed to gather prospective epidemiological data on the impact
      of and risk factors for endometriosis across countries worldwide. A study of this scale and
      scope has never been performed; it is anticipated that the study will provide novel insights
      into the effects of the condition and associated symptoms on women s lives across different
      countries, as well as explore differences in the effects of various potential risk factors.

      This is an international study conducted at more than 20 sites worldwide and coordinated by
      Oxford University in the United Kingdom. At the National Institutes of Health, 250
      premenopausal women between 18 and 45 years of age who are having their first diagnostic
      laparoscopy or laparoscopy for tubal sterilization will participate. None will have had a
      prior diagnosis of endometriosis through surgery. Women will be informed about the study
      when their laparoscopy is scheduled.

NCT01368068,Investigation of Tibolone and Escitalopram in Perimenopausal Depression,"
      Many perimenopausal women experience severe mood symptoms for the first time in their life,
      with no past psychiatric history. The importance of clearly identifying and treating a
      disorder that is increasingly referred to as ""perimenopausal depression"" is highlighted by
      the wide-reaching impact this can have on the lives of women suffering from it. This is not
      a minor or short term mood disturbance; it is a severe depressive illness, needing effective
      and early treatment. Relationships, employment, participation in social roles and individual
      well-being can all be disrupted by the combination of the mood, hormonal and physical
      changes associated with the transition to menopause. The term ""perimenopausal depression""
      denotes the onset of depression coinciding with the onset of reproductive hormone changes.

      Many women with this type of depression experience serious and long term debilitating
      symptoms. Treatment commonly draws on traditional approaches for the management of major
      depression including the use of antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake
      inhibitors (SSRIs) as the first line response. However, standard treatment of perimenopausal
      depression using antidepressants has only shown small improvements at best and at worst, is
      associated with severe side effects. Some SSRIs have been shown to be less effective in
      postmenopausal women compared to child bearing age women. Hormone treatments directly
      targeting the fluctuating reproductive hormone systems (in particular estrogen) through the
      administration of compounds such as tibolone, have significant potential as a better overall
      treatment.

      To date, there is still a lack of clear clinical evidence about the best approach for the
      biological treatment of women with perimenopausal depression. The project we now propose to
      conduct is a 12-week randomised controlled trial (RCT) of 2.5 mg/day tibolone compared to
      10mg/day of escitalopram (an SSRI that has targeted serotonin action)compared to placebo to
      discover the best treatment approach for a hitherto understudied depression that affects a
      large proportion of women in their late forties and fifties.

      population in endometrium could explain the incorrect proliferation of these cells, which
      would lead to formation of endometriotic foci.

NCT01428713,Tranexamic Acid (TA) vs Combined Oral Contraceptive (COCP) Pilot Study,"
      Menorrhagia, considered a public health challenge and reported by 5 to 10% of adult women,
      is encountered even more frequently in adolescents. Surveys of school students in the United
      States (US) and Europe reported menorrhagia in 37% to 55% of adolescent females. Medical
      management of adolescent menorrhagia includes various formulations of hormonal therapy and
      the antifibrinolytic agent epsilon aminocaproic acid. Oral tranexamic acid (TA), a more
      potent antifibrinolytic agent used as standard therapy for menorrhagia in adult women and in
      adolescent women in Europe and Canada, was not previously available in the US. Subsequent to
      US FDA approval in November 2009 of a novel oral TA formulation to treat cyclic heavy
      menstrual bleeding in adult women, this medication is currently included in the treatment
      armamentarium for adult menorrhagia. There is currently no preliminary data available in the
      US about the clinical use of oral TA in an exclusive adolescent population with menorrhagia.
      Oral contraceptive pills (OCP) are considered standard therapy in the management of
      menorrhagia in teen-aged women. Oral TA has been shown to be more efficacious than
      progesterone-only hormonal therapy for menorrhagia in adult women. However, there is no data
      available comparing the efficacy of oral TA and combined OCP (COCP) in adult women or in
      adolescents with menorrhagia.

      The study hypothesis is that, in adolescent menorrhagia, oral TA will have comparable
      efficacy in reducing menstrual blood loss (MBL) and improving quality of life (QOL) when
      compared to the commonly prescribed COCP.

      This hypothesis was tested by comparing the efficacy of these two medications, in a

NCT01601366,LNG-IUS for Treatment of Dysmenorrhea,"
      Adenomyosis is a disease entity diagnosed when endometrial glands and stroma deep in the
      myometrium are associated with surrounding myometrial hypertrophy. The finding classically
      associated with adenomyosis is excessive uterine bleeding accompanied by worsening
      dysmenorrhea. The advent of endovaginal US has substantially improved the ability to
      diagnose adenomyosis. Different US features of adenomyosis have been reported, including
      uterine enlargement not explainable by the presence of leiomyomas, asymmetric thickening of
      the anterior or posterior myometrial wall, lack of contour abnormality or mass effect,
      heterogeneous poorly circumscribed areas within the myometrium, anechoic lacunae or cysts of
      varying sizes, and increased echotexture of the myometrium.

      Transvaginal power Doppler application is useful in studying the vascular tree of
      adenomyosis and can aid clinicians in planning the most appropriate therapeutic strategy.
      The differential diagnosis using power Doppler sonography is based on vascular
      characteristics. Adenomyosis is characterized by a preserved vascular texture supply that
      results in dilated spiral arteries running perpendicular toward the myometrium into the
      endometrial surface. Leiomyomata exhibits a vascular tree that typically circumscribes the
      solid mass. 2D transvaginal power Doppler angiography should be used to improve diagnostic
      sensitivity and facilitate appropriate therapeutic intervention.

      The levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (IUS), Mirena, has been approved in Europe
      for contraception since 1990. Because of the suppressive effect of levonorgestrel on the
      endometrium, Mirena has also been proven to be effective for the management of menorrhagia
      and dysmenorrhea, and as a progestin component in postmenopausal hormone therapy. It was
      introduced in Taiwan in 1995 as an alternative therapy for idiopathic menorrhagia. Many
      cases of menorrhagia are caused by adenomyosis, and Mirena was, therefore, introduced for
      the treatment of adenomyosis in Taiwan.

      The current study is designed to evaluate the best treatment modality for treatment of
      adenomyosis clinical by assessment of dysmenorrhea and or chronic pelvic pain by visual
      analogue scale and menstrual blood loss by menstrual diary, imaging by ultrasound and

      fibroids who undergo treatment with the Acessa device. The Acessa device is a new FDA
      approved minimally invasive treatment for uterine fibroids that uses radiofrequency energy
      to destroy fibroid tissue. The fibroids then shrink and symptoms are significantly improved.
      The radiofrequency energy is delivered to the fibroids during an outpatient surgical
      procedure. There is minimal blood loss and pain and women return to the usual activities 5-9
      days after the Acessa procedure.

      The investigators will evaluate changes in fibroid-related symptoms from before the Acessa
      treatment to 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 months after Acessa treatment. The investigators
      will also assess operative outcomes including procedure duration, complications, blood loss,

      Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory disease associated with painful periods, pain with

      (ibuprofen, narcotics), hormonal therapies and laparoscopic surgery. The current hormonal
      therapeutic options are effective at treating pain symptoms but inhibit ovulation, which is
      a setback for women of reproductive age who are considering pregnancy. Statins, a group of
      cholesterol lowering drugs, have anti-inflammatory properties that may lessen the severity
      of pain symptoms in women with endometriosis. This pilot study will investigate whether a
      statin drug, Pravastatin sodium, can improve symptoms of pain over a period of 3-months in
      women with endometriosis. As statin therapy can decrease levels of coenzymeQ10 (coQ10),

      may also account for heavy menstrual bleedings and menstrual pain.

NCT02201719,Norwegian Adenomyosis Study I,"
      Adenomyosis is characterized by the appearance of endometrial cells in the muscular layer of
      the uterus. It affects about 15-20% of the female population.

      The symptoms of adenomyosis are heavy menstrual bleedings and painful menstruation
      (dysmenorrhea) and in addition chronic pelvic pain. Subfertility and infertility have been
      correlated with adenomyosis.

      Parity, age and uterine abrasion increase the risk of adenomyosis. Hormonal factors such as
      local hyperestrogenism and elevated levels of prolactin have been identified, but autoimmune
      and mechanical factors are also hypothesized.

      Regarding treatment, the most effective measure is hysterectomy. As this is a very drastic
      measure in younger women, levonogestrel-releasing intrauterine devices, Gonadotropin
      releasing hormone (GnRH)-analogues, Danazol, uterine embolization and endometrial ablation
      have been tried, but studies are few in number, retrospective, and have small sample sizes.

      associated with endometriosis are subfertility and pelvic pain.

      In the surgical management of deep endometriosis, the issue of fertility is pivotal. There
      is a higher rate of infertility in a population of women with endometriosis as compared to
      the general population, even though the mechanisms are not yet elucidated. Patients with
      deep endometriosis can be referred to the surgeon for subfertility, but even when they are
      referred for chronic pain, future fertility considerations are taken into account in the
      planning of the surgery, as the patients are often young.

      It is now well documented that ovarian cystectomy is deleterious with regards to the ovarian
      reserve, and more so in endometriomas than in any other type of benign cysts. The ovarian
      reserve is the functional potential of the ovaries, reflecting the quantity and quality of
      remaining follicles. Studies have also relied greatly on the measure of serum anti-mullerian
      hormone (AMH) to evaluate the effect of cystectomy on ovarian reserve, as AMH is currently
      the most reliable marker to assess ovarian reserve. A significant difference was found
      between AMH before and following cystectomy in several studies. The deleterious effect of
      deep endometriosis surgery which comprises a wide dissection and adhesiolysis of the pelvis
      in many cases, even when no cystectomy has been performed, is therefore not entirely ruled
      out. To the best of our knowledge, there are no studies on the effect of deep endometriosis
      surgery, apart from ovarian surgery, on ovarian reserve.

      Our center is very active in the laparoscopic surgical treatment of deep endometriosis, with
      more than 200 cases every year. The objective of this trial is to assess the effect of deep
      endometriosis surgery on the ovarian reserve, whether a cystectomy is performed or not, by
      measuring serum AMH before and after surgery, at 6 months and 1 year post-operatively.

      Endometriosis, one of the most common diseases of women during their reproductive period.,
      may present a chronic disabling disease with major impact on women's life. Therapeutic
      options are limited and recurrence of disease symptoms is frequent.

      The current study investigates the quality of life and several risk factors for the
      development of endometriosis as well as satisfaction with medical support in a minimum of
      600 women with different stages of endometriosis and the same number of control women
      matched for age (± 3 years) and nationality. To evaluate specific features of
      endometriosis-associated pain a second group of 100 women with chronic abdominal/pelvic pain
      not related to endometriosis is investigated. Recruitment takes place in different
      university clinics, and districts hospitals in Switzerland, Germany. And Austria. Control
      women i.e. women without any evidence for endometriosis presenting for annual routine
      gynaecological controls are collected at the same places.

      A composition of different internationally validated questionnaires as well as specific
      questions on dealing with endometriosis is used to collect information on the quality of
      life and potential risk factors for endometriosis. Questions on sexuality and partnership
      are also distributed to women's partners. All diagnosis of endometriosis and classification
      of ASRM (American Society for Reproductive Medicine) disease stages are based on woman's

NCT02633254,Targeted Vessel Ablation of Type 3 Uterine Fibroids With Magnetic Resonance Guided High Intensity Focused Ultrasound,"
      So-called type 1 and 2 uterine fibroids are well treatable with Magnetic Resonance guided
      High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (MR-HIFU). The other type, type 3 fibroids, however, are
      known for their high perfusion and poor treatment outcome after MR-HIFU. This study proposes
      a new strategy to treat type 3 fibroids with MR-HIFU. Very precise, small, high-power
      sonications (heating points) will be used to occlude (part of) the feeding vessels of the
      fibroid. This deminishes the negative effect of the high perfusion and is hypothesized to
      transform a type 3 fibroid into a type 2 or possibly even a type 1 fibroid. Consequently,
      the bulk volume of the fibroid can be treated using the standard approach.

NCT00818896,Maternal Hypothyroidism in Pregnancy,"
      There is general agreement that thyroid gland function should be assessed in pregnant women.
      When the gland produces too little thyroid hormone (hypothyroidism), all of the woman's
      bodily functions slow down, and there are problems with her baby's development. Until now,
      physicians have identified this problem on an individual basis (case-finding), but this
      approach misses many of the cases. Our trial aims to replace case-finding with a routine
      blood test that is highly effective at detecting hypothyroidism, thereby allowing treatment
      to correct the deficiency. This approach can eventually be implemented throughout the United

      recommending treatment with thyrotrophic hormone of 4-10 mUI/L and free thyroxin in normal
      range. The body changes or symptoms at this stage are often mistaken as aging. There are
      studies showing significant changes in heart (slow rate, lower ejection fraction, diastolic
      dysfunction); hypercholesterolemia, dysfunction cognitive abilities (memory attention…).

      The prevalence of SH increases with age, reaching 14% over 65 years old. This age group

NCT01072032,Cortical and Biomechanical Dynamics of Ankle Robotics Training in Stroke,"
      Reduced mobility and increased fall risk are significant long-term health problems facing
      those who have persistent weakness or paralysis in their legs resulting from stroke. Recent
      innovations in post-stroke therapy have applied motor learning principles to improve motor
      skills through regular practice of activities using the weaker limb. Because the ankle is so
      critical in providing forces for normal walking and balance function, impairments at the
      affected ankle pose a major limitation to achieving optimal rehabilitation outcomes. To
      address this we have developed a novel ankle robot (Anklebot) to enhance physical therapy
      for improving walking and balance functions after stroke. It is a computer controlled
      exercise machine that can be worn during walking or in a seated position for practice with
      video games. The Anklebot controllers allow for assisting users when they cannot complete a
      movement, or resisting movement, or simply recording movements and forces.

      Passive movement therapy has shown promise in exciting brain to muscle connections for
      recovery of walking function; however it does not appear to yield optimal results,
      suggesting that active involvement in task-oriented therapy is essential. Not only is
      voluntary movement important to initiate this excitation, the brain mechanisms of reward and
      motivation play an important role. These mechanisms have been widely studied in both humans
      and animals. Core brain networks involved in reward and motivation are designed to increase
      a person's involvement with their surroundings, to focus attention and to prompt one to
      approach reward and avoid punishers. These increases in involvement and the elevated
      emotions that are part of it have been shown to enhance performance, memory and learning.

      The primary purpose of this pilot study is to investigate responses of brain and muscle
      activity in stroke patients who use the Anklebot during a 3-week / 3-session/week motor
      learning based training. These responses will be compared to a 3-week delayed entry period
      in which the participants will perform an at-home walking program equal in time spent to the
      time they will spend on the Anklebot during the 3-week / 3x/week training. In Addition,
      after the 3-week delayed entry walking program the subjects will be divided into low and
      high reward-feedback groups. The low reward-feedback group will receive the Anklebot
      training with only immediate feedback (they will know if they succeeded on the current trial
      but they will never know their cumulative score and they will receive minimal social
      interaction with research team members. While the high-reward feedback group will know their
      cumulative scores, will receive controlled but abundant social interaction with the research
      team and will be eligible for prizes of restaurant and movie coupons during individual
      training sessions and at completion of the study. This will be done to assess the ability of
      higher reward conditions to increase recovery beyond that of the Anklebot training alone.

      To accomplish this subjects with chronic stroke will be divided into the high and
      low-reward/feedback groups and will then play a series of videogames using the Anklebot, as
      we noninvasively record brain activity using electroencephalography (EEG) and muscle
      activity using electromyography (EMG). We will also monitor heart rate using
      electrocardiograms (ECG). In addition to analyzing brain and muscle information before,
      during, and after the Anklebot training, we will also assess walking and balance functions
      immediately before and after the first and last robotic training session and ask the
      subjects to fill out some standardized questionnaires.

NCT01647750,Study of Optimal Replacement of Thyroxine in the Elderly,"
      All patients with hypothyroidism are currently treated the same way, regardless of age. The
      investigators want to look at whether people aged 80 years or older would benefit from being
      treated with lower doses of levothyroxine. There are three reasons why the investigators
      think this could be beneficial, but this is not yet proven:

        1. Some older people with hypothyroidism may have few symptoms.

        2. Doctors look at the amount of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) in the patient's blood
           to decide the dose of Thyroxine received. The standard ""normal"" TSH range used to
           determine the dose of levothyroxine is from younger people. The investigators wonder
           whether this is appropriate to all age ranges particularly as the investigators know
           that older people may normally have higher TSH values.

        3. If TSH levels are too low there may be a slight increased risk of problems such as
           brittle bones or an irregular heartbeat.

      The best way to test whether older people benefit from lower doses of levothyroxine is by a
      large clinical trial. Before the investigators can do this, the investigators need to run a
      smaller clinical trial called a ""pilot study"" (SORTED 1) to examine whether this is
      practical and acceptable. The pilot study aims to recruit 50 patients with hypothyroidism
      aged 80 or above.

      Participants will be randomly allocated to receive their routine or lower dose of
      levothyroxine. Follow-up will be conducted over approximately 25 weeks.

      The investigators also propose a qualitative study (SORTED 2) to specifically understand
      patient's willingness to take part in a RCT and participant's experience of the
      intervention.

      Finally, the investigators propose a retrospective cohort study of 400 treated hypothyroid
      patients aged 80 years or more registered in 2008 in Primary Care Practices with the aim of
      studying outcomes after 4 years. The cohort study will collect data required to inform a
      sample size calculation for a future full study where the primary outcome will be 4 year
      mortality.

NCT01665781,Erythropoietin in the Prevention of Acute Mountain Sickness,"
      Acute mountain sickness (AMS) is a syndrome of nonspecific symptoms and is therefore
      subjective. The Lake Louise Consensus Group defined acute mountain sickness as the presence
      of headache in an unacclimatized person who has recently arrived at an altitude above 2,500
      m plus the presence of one or more of the following: gastrointestinal symptoms (anorexia,
      nausea, or vomiting), insomnia, dizziness, and lassitude or fatigue. An increase in RBC mass
      is a natural feature of altitude acclimatization. Hypoxia-induced erythropoietin (EPO)
      secretion begins hours after ascent and stimulates bone marrow production of red blood
      cells, but this takes weeks to effect an increase in red cell mass . Therefore, it is
      feasible that EPO therapy weeks before altitude exposure decrease high altitude illness.

      In 1996, Young et al in U.S. Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine (USARIEM)
      reported that autologous erythrocyte infusion did not ameliorate the decrement in maximal
      oxygen uptake at 4,300m altitude despite increasing arterial oxygen carrying capacity. On
      the basis of this report, USARIEM did not recommend use of recombinant EPO for altitude
      acclimatization.

      However, increases in erythrocyte count, hematocrit and hemoglobin associated with EPO
      therapy have been shown to decrease fatigue and increase work capacity and exercise
      tolerance. In addition, improvement in CNS function and cognitive ability has been noted
      with EPO therapy. Subjective benefits include improvement in sleep habits, tolerance to
      cold; decreased dyspnea, anginal symptoms and tachycardia and improved appetite, all of
      which are symptoms associated with high altitude illness.

      The investigators also reported improved muscle energy metabolism with EPO in dialysis
      patients, but not with RBC transfusion.

      In this study, the investigators will conduct a randomised controlled trial to assess the
      effect of EPO administration on AMS at an altitude of 4,130 m.

NCT01716871,The Using of NEurocryostimulation in Military Ankle Sprains,"
      Introduction: The military population is at high-risk for injury with by painful sprains,
      especially of the ankle. The referenced treatment method for pain is the cryotherapy,
      consisting in applying cold-packs to the injured ankle several times a day. However, another
      pain treatment has been developed and is commonly used by high-level sports teams and
      rheumatologists but its efficacy has never been assessed within a military population, i.e.
      the hyperbaric CO2 cryotherapy, also called the neurocryostimulation.

      Research design: This study was carried out on a French multicenter basis, the study
      consisting in a randomized controlled superiority trial and open-label prospective analysis
      in the treatment of 40-year-old military patients or younger suffering from acute ankle
      sprains. Two groups were made: patients were treated either by neurocryostimulation or by
      the referenced cryotherapy (cold-packs). The care protocol for both groups consisted in six
      supervised 30 minute-sessions within a period of three consecutive days.

      Hypothesis: Neurocryostimulation is more effective in the treatment of pain severity
      resulting from an ankle sprain than the referenced treatment by cold-packs. Moreover, we
      theorized that the total consumption of paracetamol and the number of days of temporary
      inaptitude and of work exemption were lower in patients treated by neurocryostimulation.

      Outcomes:

      For each session, pain severity is assessed on a 100-mm Visual Analog Scale at the beginning
      and at the end of session 20 minutes later after a four-step walk.

NCT01916018,Clinical and Genetic Analysis in Congenital Hypothyroidism Due to Thyroid Dysgenesis.,"
      Congenital hypothyroidism (CH) is a rare disease that affects 1 in 3500 newborn. This
      condition is detected consistently since the late 1970s in France, which has led to early
      care and a significant improvement in prognosis and intellectual stature of these children.
      However neurodevelopmental disorders persist in 10-15% of cases. More associated diseases
      have been reported in approximately 10% of cases. These observations are in most cases
      poorly understood. The family nature of the CH is now well recognized and a dozen genes
      involved up to now. However, in the majority of cases (HC not due to a disorder of the
      organification of iodine), few mutations have been found in the reported number of patients
      (5-10%), suggesting the involvement of other genes. Some of the genes have been implicated
      in particular specific syndromic forms but many pathological associations remain
      unexplained. Also, a more complete genetic elucidation of CH would enable a better
      understanding of its etiology and thus its risk of familial recurrence (frequently asked
      questions by parents of children with CH) and secondly the presence of associated
      pathologies.

      Main goal: to describe the population with CH (not due to a disorder of the organification
      of iodine) not only on clinical, biological and radiological (phenotypic analysis) but also
      on the genetic level to establish a genotype / phenotype correlation.

NCT02029378,Inhibition of Complement Activation (Eculizumab) in Guillain-Barre Syndrome Study,"
      Guillian-Barre Syndrome (GBS) is the most frequent cause of acute neuromuscular weakness in
      the Western World and can occur at any age. GBS is a rpadily progressive 'inflammatory'
      disorder of the perihperal nerves often leading to sever paresis of the limbs. Most GBS
      patients also have sensory disturbances (tingling or dull feeling) and pain. Some patients
      also have double vision or problems with swallowing. GBS mau also involve the respiratory
      muscles, leading to insufficient ventilation and admission to an intensive care unit. GBS
      pateints have a vairable prognosis; 20-30% require mechnical ventilation for a period
      ranging from weeks to months, 20% are unable to walk after 6 months nad 3-5% dies.
      Progression of weakness in GBS is usually rapid and reaches its peak within 4 weeks in the
      majority of patients, but many develop their maximum deficit within 2 weeks. Thereafter, the
      patients have a variable prognosis.

      GBS is a treatable disorder. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) 2g/kg administered in 5 days
      was shown to be effective when administered within the first two weeks after onset of
      symptoms, and is considered the treatment of choice by most experts in the field. Although
      the standard treatment for GBS is a single course of IVIg (2g/kg administered in 5 days),
      many patients fails to recover abd remain with substantial disability. Patients with GBS and
      especially those with a poor prognosis potentially may benefit from more powerful abd when
      possible a more mechanistically rational therapy.

      Recent experimental evidence suggests that complement activation palys a crucial role in the
      development of neuromuscular weakness in GBS making complement inhibitors and regulators
      attracive therapeutic targets. Our hypothesis is that Eculizumab, with its function as a
      complement inhibitor, will be very effective in preventing progression of weakness in
      patients with GBS.

      The overall goal of this study is to establish a new pre-rehabilitation program in the
      prevention of muscle injury in the legs of healthy people serving in the military and
      injured individuals with muscle wasting following leg injuries. The specific goals include:
      1) the amount of exercise that causes injury to healthy muscle in the lower leg of healthy
      people; 2) what is the effect of an intervention (pre-rehabilitation program) on decreasing
      how easily the muscle of the lower leg can be injured in healthy people; 3a) what amount of
      exercise causes injury to muscle that has recently been injured and is recovering and 3b)
      the effect of the new pre-rehabilitation program on the muscles of the lower leg when the
      muscle has recently been injured and is still recovering.

      For the first goal, the investigators will determine how easily the muscle can get injured
      from a specific exercise in 6 healthy, conditioned men and women. Participants will perform
      different amounts of exercise with the lower leg muscles to see how easily the muscle can be
      damaged. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be used to estimate how much damage occurs
      with the different levels of exercise. For the second goal, the investigators will examine
      the effect of a new pre-rehabilitation program on decreasing how easily muscle gets damaged
      from the exercise we did in the first goal. The investigators will invite healthy people to
      participate in this goal. The investigators will use MRI, blood markers, and pain as ways of
      assessing muscle damage in 10 people who do the pre-rehabilitation program before exercising
      and 10 who do not do the new program. The third goal will focus on a) determining how easily
      muscle gets injured that has recently recovered from some trauma (5 people will participate
      in this part of the third goal), and b) determining how a pre-rehabilitation program
      decreases how easily a muscle that has just recovered from trauma gets injured from exercise
      (10 people will participate in this part of the third goal).

      The purpose of this clinical trial is to determine if Domperidone in a dose of 40 mg daily
      can prevent worsening of walking ability in people secondary progressive MS. The number of
      participants in this study will be 62. A maximum of 75 people with secondary progressive MS
      will be included. Each patient will be followed for 12 months from inclusion. Domperidone is
      a medication which has been shown to increase levels of the hormone prolactin. The best
      understood function of prolactin is the stimulation of milk production in women after
      delivery. However, the increase in prolactin levels seen in patients treated with standard
      doses of Domperidone (in doses of up to 80mg per day) usually does not lead to clinical
      symptoms. Prolactin has been shown to improve myelin repair in mice. Domperidone therefore
      may also improve myelin repair in people with MS. Domperidone is currently approved in
      Canada to treat slow moving bowels and nausea, for instance in patients with Parkinson's
      Disease or Diabetes Mellitus, where too slowly moving bowels can cause constipation.
      Domperidone is available as a tablet that is usually taken four times per day. Doses up to
      80mg per day may be used but we estimate that a dose of only 40mg daily will be needed to
      stimulate myelin repair. Domperidone is usually well tolerated.

      Adding vancomycin to the antibiotic regimen is recommended for the treatment of pneumococcal
      meningitis in adults. Use of dexamethasone as adjunct therapy has proved to reduce mortality
      and neurologic sequelae in adult patients with pneumococcal meningitis. However, use of
      dexamethasone may impair penetration of vancomycin in cerebrospinal fluid. In a purely
      observational manner, we thought to measure blood and CSF concentrations of vancomycin in
      adult patients with pneumococcal meningitis, treated with vancomycin, third-generation
      cephalosporin and dexamethasone.

NCT00226304,Evaluation of Brain Lesions in HIV-infected Patients for Diagnosis of Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma,"
      This study will evaluate the usefulness of two tests in quickly distinguishing whether a
      patient with HIV infection and focal brain lesions (an injury in a specific area of the
      brain) has a rare type of cancer called primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL), or
      a parasitic infection called toxoplasmic encephalitis.

      Toxoplasmic encephalitis is caused by a parasite and can be treated with antibiotics. PCNSL
      (lymphoma of the brain or spinal cord) must be definitively diagnosed with a brain biopsy
      (removal of a small piece of brain tissue), and the treatment is radiation therapy and
      chemotherapy.

      The tests under study for diagnosing PCNSL or toxoplasmic encephalitis are measurement of
      Epstein Barr virus (EBV) DNA in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and FDG-PET scan of the brain. EBV
      is often found in the CSF of people with PCNSL. The study also will compare the accuracy of
      two imaging techniques-TI-SPECT and FDG-PET-in distinguishing between toxoplasmosis and
      PCNSL.

      Patients 18 years of age and older who have HIV infection and at least one focal brain
      lesion without a prior history of PCNSL or toxoplasmic encephalitis may be eligible for this
      study. Each candidate is screened with a medical history, physical examination, blood and
      urine tests and MRI scans of the brain.

      Upon entering the study, all participants take medication to treat toxoplasmic encephalitis.
      They undergo lumbar puncture (spinal tap) to obtain CSF for analysis, an FDG-PET scan, and a
      201TI-SPECT scan. For the PET scan, a radioactive substance is injected into an arm,
      followed by scanning in a doughnut-shaped machine similar to a CT scanner. SPECT is similar
      to PET but uses a different radioactive tracer, and the patient lies on a table while the
      SPECT camera rotates around the patient's head. Patients whose test results indicate a low
      risk for lymphoma continue antibiotic therapy for toxoplasmosis. They have repeat MRI scans
      around 4, 7, and 14 days after starting the drug to monitor the response to therapy.
      Antiretroviral therapy is initiated in patients who are not already on such a regimen.

      Patients whose test results indicate a high risk for PCNSL have a CT scan to look for
      evidence of lymphoma elsewhere in the body and are referred for consultation with a
      neurosurgeon to discuss undergoing a brain biopsy. The brain biopsy is done in the operating
      room under general anesthesia. A small cut is made in the scalp and a small opening is made
      in the skull over the area of the brain to be biopsied. A needle is placed in the opening in
      the skull and, guided by CT or MRI, moved to the abnormal area of the brain, where a small
      piece of tissue is removed for study under a microscope.

      Patients found to have toxoplasmosis are discharged from the hospital to the care of their
      primary care physician after they are getting better and are tolerating all their
      medications. They return to NIH for follow-up visits about 4 weeks, and 6 months after
      discharge.

      Patients found to have lymphoma are referred to the National Cancer Institute for screening
      for enrollment in a treatment protocol. Patients who are not eligible for a treatment
      protocol are referred back to their primary care physician or for another NIH treatment
      protocol, if one is available. Patients with lymphoma are seen at the NIAID outpatient
      clinic for follow-up visits and laboratory examinations every 3 months for 2 years.

NCT00619203,Oral Glycerol and High-Dose Rectal Paracetamol to Improve the Prognosis of Childhood Bacterial Meningitis,"
      Bacterial meningitis remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in children,
      especially in countries with limited resources. Efforts to improve the grim outcome have
      included altering the first line antibiotic therapy, controlling seizures and managing
      fluids more carefully. Adjuvant therapy of steroids has been used with limited success in
      children in the West and with no proven value in Malawi and other resource constrained
      settings. Glycerol has been used to reduce brain oedema in neurosurgery and it has recently
      been shown to reduce morbidity in childhood meningitis in South America. Paracetamol in a
      high dosage has been shown to reduce inflammation and cytokine levels in septicaemia with
      improved outcomes in adults.

      In Malawi the investigators have tried adjuvant steroids with no improvement in outcome of
      childhood meningitis. They have recently concluded a study of ceftriaxone which has shown no
      improvement in mortality though there is less hearing loss than with chloramphenicol and
      benzyl penicillin.

      Following the encouraging results of the Childhood South American Study it is important to
      assess the use of adjuvant glycerol in children in the investigators' setting. Paracetamol
      is routinely used in meningitis because of the accompanying fever and headache. This is an
      opportunity to study its place as adjuvant therapy more carefully than has previously been
      done.

      The investigators propose a prospective, randomized, double blind 2 by 2 factorial designed
      study to assess the advantage of ceftriaxone (antibiotic) given with paracetamol and
      glycerol in combination, singly or with neither adjuvant therapy in childhood bacterial
      meningitis.

      Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is an inherited disorder of unknown etiology,
      characterized by recurrent episodes of fever, peritonitis and/or pleuritis.

      Fever is the cardinal manifestation of FMF and is present in most attacks accompanied by
      abdominal pain.

      Another clinical manifestation in patients with FMF is exertional muscle pain, usually in
      the thigh, which appears even after minor exercise or physical activity in young patients
      with generally good health (other than FMF) and in good physical condition. Some patients
      also complain of ankle edema after relatively minor physical activity, which subsides after
      a night rest. Although these manifestations are quite common in FMF patients and form part
      of the minor criteria for the diagnosis, the etiopathogenesis has not been examined.

      The purpose of the suggested study is to evaluate and characterize the anatomical and
      biochemical changes in the muscles of the thigh and in the ankle triggered by physical
      activity in FMF patients complaining of exertional lower leg myalgias and edema after minor

NCT00766064,Effects of Paliperidone in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD),"
      Chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating disorder and treatment
      response to pharmacological interventions has been modest for these patients. Chronic
      elevated anxiety and associated psychophysiological parameters including increased heart
      rate and alterations in skin conductance are key symptoms of chronic PTSD. Antidepressants,
      including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) or norepinephrine-serotonin
      re-uptake inhibitors are considered treatment of first choice for these patients, however a
      substantial portion of patients do not respond sufficiently (Zhang and Davidson 2007).
      Therefore, there is a need to establish novel and effective add-on treatment strategies for
      these patients. Recently, atypical neuroleptics have received considerable attention since
      it was shown in multiple controlled and naturalistic trials that these medications are an
      effective treatment option for patients with PTSD (Davis et al 2006). In chronic PTSD, the
      psychophysiological responses at baseline and in response to treatment have yet been
      inadequately studied and may provide novel insight into antidepressant and anxiolytic
      mechanisms of medications used in the treatment of PTSD. Therefore, in addition to
      evaluating the antidepressant and anxiolytic effects of paliperidone, a novel atypical
      neuroleptic, in the treatment of PTSD, we also aim to compare neurophysiological responses
      at baseline with post-treatment effects in antidepressant-refractory PTSD patients.

      Primary Aim 1: Evaluate the anxiolytic and antidepressant effects of paliperidone in
      patients with PTSD.

      Secondary Aim 2: Evaluate the effects of paliperidone on fear conditioned
      psychophysiological responses (including startle eyeblink, skin conductance, and
      cardiovascular inter-beat interval) at baseline and after 6 weeks of naturalistic treatment
      in chronic PTSD patients.

NCT01481922,What Needle Diameter Should Physician Use When They Perform Lumbar Puncture ? A Randomized Controlled Trial,"
      This study is intended to help guide the choice of needle diameter when performing a lumbar
      puncture.

      Smaller spinal needles have been shown to decrease rate of adverse events such as
      post-lumbar puncture headache and hearing loss.

      The main drawback to using smaller needles is diminished flow rate; some textbooks recommend
      using needles no smaller than 22 gauge because of the slow flow rate though others recommend
      smaller needles, namely 22-24 gauge.

      Some authors have described a successful use of spinal needles as small as 25 gauge when
      performing a lumbar puncture.

      The investigators do not believe that the flow-rate difference between 22 and 24 gauge
      needles is significant enough to justify using the larger needles.

      The investigators trial will compare the Whitacre 22 gauge and Whitacre 24 gauge needles for
      flow rate, and incidence of the known complications of pain during procedure and backache at
      8 and 15 days post-procedure.

NCT01503788,Bedside Sedation for the Prevention of Post Dural Puncture Headache,"
      Dural or lumbar puncture (LP), the passing of a needle into the space of the spinal cord, is
      a common procedure in everyday clinical practice. The most common use for LP is to measure
      the spinal fluid pressure and sample spinal fluid for laboratory analysis. However, it is
      also used for therapeutic purposes, such as administering chemotherapy or spinal anesthesia.

      A notorious side effect of dural puncture is headache that ranges from mild to debilitating
      and may last for several days following the procedure. Among diagnosed patients, 39%
      experience at least 1 week of impaired ability to perform activities of daily living. The
      likelihood of developing a headache after dural puncture depends on a number of factors. As
      fluid leak is assumed to be the culprit mechanism in this headache strategies to minimize
      the leak seem to offer the best path to lowering the incidence of headache after diagnostic
      LP, the commonest clinical context of dural puncture in medical practice.

      Lumbar puncture is a highly stressful event for most patients. As both pain and anxiety
      cause adrenergic stimulation, they also cause an increase in ICP. We believe that this mild
      increase in ICP, occurring before the puncture as well as during the puncture itself may
      exacerbate the pressure difference between the CSF space and the epidural space and so
      worsen the CSF leak Furthermore, this excess pressure, although mild, might cause the dural
      puncture hole to widen slightly and so further augment the leak and possibly even prolong
      it. Furthermore, the very anticipation of pain causes a rise in neurotransmitters that may
      cause a sensitization effect and worsen pain. This increase in adrenergic drive as well as
      the sensitization to pain can be effectively blunted by the periprocedural use of mild IV
      sedation. Benzodiazepines, with their sedative-hypnotic qualities are well suited for this
      task.

      This study aims to test the effect of mild peri-procedural IV sedation using Midazolam on
      the rates of headache after diagnostic LP.

      Patients undergoing a diagnostic LP will be randomized into two groups. Group 1 will undergo
      the procedure as routinely practiced. Group 2 will be given Midazolam IV 10-5 minutes prior
      to the procedure and undergo the same diagnostic procedure. All patients in the study will
      remain under observation in the hospital for at least 6 hours.

      Patients will be evaluated for headache and specifically for headache. Clinical follow up
      will continue for 72 hours by administering a short questionnaire over the telephone.

NCT01540838,Slow Initial β-lactam Infusion With High-dose Paracetamol to Improve the Outcomes of Childhood Bacterial Meningitis,"
      The main purpose of this trial is to test if mortality of childhood bacterial meningitis can
      be reduced by slow, continuous infusion of cefotaxime initially, instead of the traditional
      bolus administration four times daily (qid), combined with high-dose paracetamol orally,
      when both treatments are executed for the first 4 days. The series will be collected at
      Hospital Pediátrico David Bernardino, Luanda, Angola.

      The recruitment of patients begins, the conditions permitting, in early 2012. The criteria
      for patient participation is a child at the age of 2 months to 15 years who presents with
      the symptoms and signs suggestive of bacterial meningitis, for whom a lumbar puncture is
      performed, and the cerebrospinal fluid analysis suggests bacterial meningitis.

NCT01781247,Myocardial Infarction - Stress Prevention Intervention,"
      Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a mental disorder that may occur after someone
      experiences a traumatic event. Between 10-20% of patients may develop PTSD in response to
      the traumatic experience of myocardial infarction (MI). PTSD is associated with impaired
      quality of life, social functioning, and high economic burden to the society. Posttraumatic
      stress attributable to MI has also been shown to be predictive of poor cardiovascular
      prognosis, whereby this link might relate to several atherothrombotic processes. Therefore
      the prevention of PTSD after MI is of high relevance. Guidelines have been published for
      early interventions to prevent the development of posttraumatic stress after different types
      of trauma but not in terms of acute MI as a traumatic event.

      The overarching aim of the planned trial is to test whether a minimal behavioral
      intervention performed shortly after acute MI in patients at a high risk to develop PTSD and
      in the setting of a coronary care unit reduces the development of posttraumatic stress.

      The primary hypothesis is that posttraumatic stress levels at the 3-month follow-up will be
      at least 20% lower in the intervention group than in the control group, and that this effect
      will last up to 12 months after the intervention. The secondary hypothesis is that the
      intervention group will show better psychosocial functioning, and a more favourable
      cardiometabolic biomarker profile than the control group 3 and 12 month after the
      intervention.

NCT01799837,Norepinephrine Transporter Availability in PTSD,"
      The objective of this proposal is to collect pilot data to characterize the binding of
      [11C]MENET in combat-exposed war veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
      Approximately two hundred thousand veterans will be returning stateside upon the end of
      combat operations in Iraq, and 13% of returning veterans will have PTSD. 15% of all war
      veterans will develop chronic PTSD symptoms requiring a lifetime of mental health care.
      Little is known about the dysregulation of PTSD veteran's neurochemical state including the
      noradrenergic system which plays a primary role in memory and stress response. This includes
      heightened anxiety, fear and hyperarousal symptoms characteristic of PTSD. The noradrenergic
      system is a concentration of neurons in the brainstem nucleus, locus coerulues, that have
      projections to the amygdale and prefrontal cortex. The norepinephrine transporter (NET) is
      responsible for regulating and terminating noradrenergic transmission, and is a specific
      marker for neuronal integrity. Hyperactivity of the noradrenergic system up-regulates NET
      protein. An unresolved problem in studying the noradrenergic system is identification of
      suitable radiopharmaceutical to non-invasively measure alterations in the density of NET.
      The investigators propose to address this challenge by using positron emission tomography
      (PET) to measure stress-induced changes in NET expression in combat-exposed war veterans
      with PTSD. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that war veterans with PTSD have an
      up-regulation of NET in the locus coerulues resulting from hyperactivity of the
      noradrenergic system compared to healthy controls. Through a series of experiments, the
      investigators will determine the in vivo binding characteristics of [11C]MENET. The
      investigators will use this information to optimally design an experimental protocol to
      measure the availability of NET in a pilot group of combat-exposed war veterans with PTSD.
      The aims of this proposal are: 1) Measure the uptake kinetics and whole brain distribution
      of [11C]MENET in combat-exposed veterans with PTSD and healthy controls, 2) Develop a
      quantitative kinetic model of [11C]MENET uptake to calculate the NET availability in brain.
      The subjects undergoing imaging in this work will be recruited by Dr. J. Douglas Bremner
      (Co-Investigator) at Emory University and Atlanta Veteran Affairs Hospital. Our long-term
      goal is to develop a longitudinal study framework to assess the NETs dysregulation during
      onset of PTSD as well as its transition to chronic lifetime PTSD.

NCT01802502,Rifampicin Explorative PK Study for Tuberculous Meningitis Comparing Oral and Intravenous Preparation,"
      Tuberculous (TB) meningitis is the most severe manifestation of TB infection, leaving up to
      50% of patients dead or neurologically disabled. Current treatment is similar to treatment
      of lung TB, although penetration of some antibiotics into the brain is poor and the
      immune-pathology of TB meningitis is very different from pulmonary TB. In a recent phase II
      clinical trial from the investigators group, the first of its kind globally, intensified
      antibiotic treatment, with moxifloxacin and high dose rifampicin, strongly reduced mortality
      of TB meningitis.

      The investigators aim to examine the effect of intensified antibiotic treatment on mortality
      and morbidity of TB meningitis in a phase 3 clinical trial, preceded with an explorative
      pharmacokinetic (PK) study to examine if higher oral doses rifampicin result in exposures
      similar to the i.v. dose used in our phase 2 trial, since oral rifampicin could be
      implemented much easier in low-resource settings.

NCT01815125,Ondansetron for Pediatric Mild Traumatic Brain Injury,"
      Background: Most patients suffering from mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI) present
      persistent symptoms at one week post injury. A systematic review showed a paucity of studies
      for short term outcomes following mTBI. Among potential treatments for mTBI, ondansetron has
      shown promising results based on clinical experience and a single retrospective study.
      Objectives: The primary objective of this pilot study is to determine the feasibility of a
      randomized controlled trial evaluating the effect of ondansetron to decrease post concussion
      symptoms at one week following mTBI in children. More specifically, this pilot study will
      evaluate the proportion of participants who complete assessment at one week following
      intervention. Method: This will be a randomized, double blinded, controlled trial performed
      among children aged between 8 and 17 years old who sustained a mTBI in the previous 24
      hours. Participants visiting the emergency department will be randomized to receive one dose
      of either ondansetron or placebo. The primary outcome of interest is defined as an increase
      from pre-concussion baseline of at least 3 symptoms from the Post Concussion Symptom
      Inventory (PCSI) one week following trauma. Secondary outcomes will include time to full
      recovery, mean PCSI score, and outcomes at one month following head trauma. The primary
      analysis will compare the proportion of participants with persistence of symptoms at one
      week in both groups. The full study sample size was calculated to have 90% power to detect a
      decrease in the proportion of persistence of symptoms from 50% to 30% with an alpha value of
      0.05. Approximately 126 patients will therefore be recruited in each arm. The investigators
      plan to recruit 30 participants (10% of the final population) for the pilot study. Expected
      results: This pilot study should confirm the feasibility of the randomized controlled trial
      by showing that 90% of the recruited participants provide data on the primary outcome at one
      week following intervention. On the long term, the investigator expect that ondansetron will
      decrease the proportion of patients sustaining persistent symptoms of concussion from 50% to
      lower than 30%.

      different length. Standard one is 25 mm (contact space 1.7 mm) and the short one is 20 mm
      (contact space 1.3 mm). It was used in 50 patients with different inner ear malformations.
      Thirteen patients had gusher, and 11 patients oozing during cochleostomy. One patient with
      initial prototype of the cork electrode had to be revised because of persistent oozing
      around the electrode. Another patient had slow extrusion of the electrode most probably due
      to CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) pulsation and had to be revised. Both patients had no more CSF
      fistula.

      CSF fistula in inner ear malformations is a serious situation which may lead to recurrent

NCT02119533,Concussion and Post Traumatic Stress in Traumatic Brain Injury,"
      Mild brain injury or concussion affects about four million Americans each year. Some people
      recover completely while others, especially those with multiple concussions, develop chronic
      headaches, neurodegenerative diseases and psychiatric disorders. One of the reasons that
      concussion is difficult to treat is that it is difficult to detect. Radiographic studies
      such as CT (computed tomography scan) are by definition unrevealing of structural injury in
      concussed patients. Some MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) sequences may be useful adjuncts
      in the diagnosis of concussion but even these are not consistently present in all patients
      with symptoms. Clinical tests for concussion often require baseline studies, and thus are
      generally reserved for athletes and others at highest risk for concussion.

      The investigators have developed a novel eye movement tracking algorithm performed while
      subjects watch television or a music video that determines whether the eyes are moving
      together (conjugate) or are subtly not together (disconjugate). The investigators

NCT02263235,In Vivo Alzheimer Proteomics,"
      In France, an estimated 860 000 patients are affected by Alzheimer Disease (AD) which
      represents, as in other developed countries, a major public health issue. In many cases, AD
      diagnosis is uncertain and its clinical evolution unpredictable. The exactitude of the
      diagnosis is however particularly important in the perspective of the validation and use of
      new therapeutic strategies in AD. Detection of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diagnosis
      biomarkers fell short in the detection, of atypical/mixed cases, of some differential
      diagnosis, and in differentiating rapid or slow clinical evolutions. Hence, CSF analysis
      gives a unique opportunity to detect and validate biomarkers in many neurological disorders.
      Nevertheless, in medical practice, CSF biological analysis is currently limited to a small
      number of analytes.Quantitative and targeted mass spectrometry, especially operated in the
      Multiple reaction monitoring mode (MRM), represents an alternative to immunodetection and
      could be used to detect specific biomarkers in complex matrices such as plasma by
      specifically discriminating the proteotypic peptides corresponding to each proteins. Mass
      spectrometry has also the ability to distinguish and quantify isotopically labelled and
      unlabeled selected targets. This ability was used in a publication by the group of R.

NCT02486783,"Infection, Sepsis and Meningitis in Surinamese Neonates","
      Suriname is a small developing country in South America with a population of half a million
      people. Early neonatal death in Suriname is high with 16 per 1000 live births. Unpublished
      data from the Suriname Perinatal and Infant Mortality Survey estimate contribution of
      infection to early neonatal mortality at 25% (4 per 1000 live births) of all deaths. In
      comparison, incidence rates of neonatal sepsis alone are 3.5 per 1000 live births. These
      numbers indicate an increased burden of neonatal infection in Suriname versus the U.S. In
      any case about 40 newborns that die each year of infection are a huge loss, also considering
      the small Surinamese community. Despite this overall idea on the impact of infectious
      disease in Surinamese neonates exact information regarding incidence, type of infection
      (e.g., localized, viral, early-onset or late-onset sepsis), risk factors (e.g., insufficient
      antenatal care, maternal Group B-Streptococcus status), etiology, microbial causes,
      morbidity, antibiotic treatment (type and duration), and epidemiological determinants (e.g.,
      gestational age, sex, ethnicity) are lacking.

      From a clinical perspective, there is still a challenge to identify neonates with infection.
      Neonates are often admitted with ambivalent clinical symptoms and receive preventive
      antibiotics that are costly, promote pathogen-resistance, and have negative long-term
      effects (i.e., on the development of the intestinal bacterial flora). Currently, assessment
      of blood leukocyte or trombocyte counts and levels of CRP are insufficiently sensitive to be
      used as biomarkers, while confirmation of actual sepsis or meningitis by positive culture
      results is relatively rare (0.5-3% in the United States). This complicates decisions on
      duration of antibiotic treatment and hospitalization significantly, while no other
      biomarkers exist.

      The circulating isoforms of adhesion molecules (cAMs), which mediate interactions of
      leukocytes with the vascular endothelium, have been proposed as biomarkers for infection and
      sepsis. During infection they accumulate in the bloodstream as a result of shedding, which
      represents their removal from cell surfaces of endothelial cells and leukocytes by enzymes
      called sheddases. Recently, we have reviewed mechanisms behind shedding of cAMs in neonatal,
      pediatric and adult sepsis. The shedding process reflects a critical and active process in
      orchestrating interaction between leukocytes and the endothelium for an effective host
      response, while minimizing collateral tissue damage. As a result, both plasma levels of cAMs
      and their sheddases are subject to change during infection and sepsis. Additionally,
      compelling, albeit limited, data suggest changes of levels of cAMs in CSF in adult and
      pediatric meningitis.

      To date, some evidence exists of changes in levels of cAMs during malaria (in children from
      Malawi) and sepsis, although not sensitive enough to predict outcomes in the clinic. Those
      levels have never been assessed simultaneously with levels of their sheddases in blood or
      CSF as a diagnostic tool. We propose that this combined approach may provide more detailed
      information about the extent of inflammatory activation in neonates.While a balance in
      levels is maintained under resting conditions or mild (local) infection, it may be perturbed
      during sepsis or meningitis . Thus, simultaneous measurement of these levels could promote
      early identification of infection, and may even distinguish between mild infection, systemic
      infection or meningitis. Currently, manufacturers are rapidly developing Luminex® technology
      as an advanced, fast, high-throughput and clinically feasible bedside tool for such an
      approach.

      We hypothesize that incidence rates of neonates with infection in Suriname are high. We
      further hypothesize that, upon signs of infection, the simultaneous measurement of cAMs and
      their SEs in serum and CSF discriminates between infected and non-infected neonates. We aim
      to: 1) identify and follow neonates at the Academic Hospital Paramaribo with signs of
      infection to establish incidence rates of infection, and 2) investigate diagnostic potential
      of our proposed biomarker combination in these neonates for infection, type of infection
      (e.g., local (mild), sepsis or meningitis) and outcomes.

NCT00001220,Ultrasound and Videofluoroscopy for Diagnosing Swallowing Disorders,"
      This study will identify clinical signs and symptoms critical for diagnosing swallowing
      disorders and will characterize swallowing problems in various patient populations, such as
      patients with Parkinson's disease, stroke, post-polio syndrome, multiple sclerosis and other
      conditions that cause swallowing abnormalities.

      Patients with swallowing difficulties who are enrolled in NIH neurology or speech pathology
      protocols may be eligible for this study. Participants will undergo the following
      procedures:

        1. Oral examination-A neurologist and speech pathologist examine the patient's swallowing
           function. The patient is interviewed about difficulties with food intake, chewing and
           swallowing during meals.

        2. Ultrasound examination-Ultrasound creates image of areas inside the body using sound
           waves. With the patient in a sitting position, a 3/4-inch transducer (device for
           transmitting and receiving sound waves) is placed under the chin to visualize tongue
           movements during swallowing.

        3. Modified barium swallow-While standing or sitting, the patient swallows 1/2 teaspoon of
           flavored barium (a radioactive substance) six times (a total of 3 teaspoons), while the
           tongue and pharynx (tube leading from the mouth to the esophagus) are scanned and
           videotaped. The barium is given in three consistencies-thin, medium and thick
           (pudding-like).

        4. Electromyography-A small plastic strip with wires attached is placed under the
           patient's chin. The patient then swallows 1/2 ounce of barium three times in a row, and
           the movement of the chin muscles during swallowing is displayed. Patients may also be
           asked to swallow 5/8 cup of barium twice; once with the head tilted upward and once
           with the head untilted.

      Depending on the test results, patients may be asked to return for follow-up study and
      monitoring.

NCT00001922,Sensory Function in Idiopathic Voice Disorders,"
      This research study is designed to improve understanding about voice disorders that are due
      to uncontrolled muscle contractions affecting the voice box. The type of voice disorder
      depends on which muscles of the voice box are involved. Abductor spasmodic dysphonia may
      lead to a weak voice. Adductor spasmodic dysphonia may result in a strangled voice. Muscular
      tension dysphonia may lead to a strained voice. Some of the major goals of the study are to;

        1. understand how sensation from the voice box affects voice and speech production

        2. develop better ways to diagnose sensation abnormalities affecting the voice box

        3. determine if patients with voice disorders differ from persons without voice disorders
           in the way they respond to sensory information from their voice box

      Researchers believe that by understanding better how sensations of the voice box are
      presented and how the muscles in the larynx respond to those sensations they will be able to
      develop better treatments for patients suffering from voice disorders. ...

NCT00066911,Brain Mapping of Voice Control,"
      Some voice disorders are caused by uncontrolled muscle actions that affect the larynx or
      voice box.

      The purpose of this study is to understand 1) how the brain controls voice production; 2)
      how changes in sensation within the voice box affect brain control of the voice box; 3) how
      the central nervous system is affected when people have motor or sensory abnormalities that
      affect the voice box; and 4) whether patients with voice disorders differ from people
      without voice disorders in the way the brain controls the voice box. By better understanding
      these concepts, researchers hope to develop improved treatments for patients with voice
      disorders.

      Forty-five healthy adult volunteers and 90 patients with voice disorders will participate in
      this study. Participants must be between the ages of 20 and 70. The study will involve two
      visits to the Clinical Center. During the first visit, participants will undergo a medical
      history and physical exam. During the second visit, investigators will perform the following
      procedures on study participants: 1) look at the voice box with a nasolaryngoscope, a fine
      tube through the nose; 2) use MRI [magnetic resonance imaging] to record brain activity
      while participants use their voice to speak; 3) changing sensation in the voice box by
      dripping a topical anesthetic onto the vocal folds; and 4) using MRI to again record brain
      activity during speech immediately after applying the topical anesthetic.

      Participants will receive up to $700 in compensation for their involvement in this study.

NCT00071734,Brain Activation During Simple Vocal Behaviors,"
      This study will examine the central regions and brain activation patterns associated with
      simple vocal behaviors under conditions of normal auditory feedback-when people hear
      themselves speak. Such feedback plays a major role in learning and maintaining human voice
      control. But voice control can be harmed by neurological injury or disease, reducing the
      ability of a person to orally communicate. Research has shown that auditory feedback is
      continuously monitored, brought about by both automatic and voluntary corrections in the
      amplitude (loudness) and frequency of (pitch) of the human voice. This study aims to
      determine which areas of the brain have activity dependent on the level of blood oxygen. It
      will provide new knowledge about basic vocal motor control and provide a basis for
      investigations into the integration of hearing and speaking in human vocal expression
      throughout life.

      Participants 18 to 45 years of age with normal hearing and voice function and with a steady
      heart rate may be eligible for this study.

      Participants will be evaluated by a speech-language specialist, regarding a history of voice
      health and measures of voice function. They will be tested on their ability to vary voice
      amplitude and frequency and tested on their hearing. Also, they will undergo an
      electrocardiogram to determine their heart rate.

      For the study, participants will undergo an MRI scan. During the MRI scan, patients will lie
      still on a table that can slide in and out of a metal cylinder surrounded by a strong
      magnetic field. Scanning time varies from 20 minutes to 3 hours, with most scans between 45
      and 90 minutes. Patients may be asked to lie still for up to 90 minutes at a time. As the
      scanner takes pictures, there will be loud knocking noises, and patients will wear
      headphones to muffle the sound. The headphones will also enable patients to hear their
      voice. The patient's head will be positioned with a coil of 25 to 30 cm diameter and
      supported by a headrest. A microphone will be placed about 2 cm from the patient's mouth for
      communication and collection of data. Also, an angled mirror will be attached to the head
      coil, so that the patient can look outside of the scanner. By way of a projection screen,
      the patient will receive a visual cue to vocalize, or use his or her voice.

      Patients will be asked to repeatedly do some of the following vocalization tasks: (1) rest,
      (2) hum or sigh without voicing (exhale), (3) hum or sigh audibly, (4) hum audibly while
      increasing or decreasing voice frequency, and (5) hum audibly while increasing or decreasing
      voice amplitude. During the scan, patients will be able to communicate with the MRI staff at
      all times and may ask to be moved out of the machine at any time. Some scans may be done in
      a 3 Tesla scanner. It is the latest advance in MRI, with a stronger magnetic field than in
      the more common 1.5 Tesla scanner. Functional MRI is done while a person is performing
      tasks, such as moving a limb or speaking. The fMRI scan will take about 1 hour.

NCT00104000,Effect of Surface Electrical Stimulation on Movement of the Larynx,"
      This study will examine whether surface electrical stimulation on the skin of the throat
      will: 1) move the larynx (voice box); 2) move the vocal folds in the larynx; and 3) cause
      less movement of the larynx when applied during swallowing. It is important that the larynx
      moves up and forward while swallowing so that food does not go into the airway. A device
      called VitalStim® (Registered Trademark), which provides electrical stimulation to the skin
      on the neck and under the chin, is widely used to treat people who have problems swallowing.
      This study will determine if VitalStim can move the voice box or the vocal folds in the
      larynx. This information is important for patients who have long-term problems raising or
      closing their larynxes when they swallow.

      Healthy volunteers between 20 and 60 years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates
      are screened with a medical history, physical examination, electrocardiogram, and
      nasoendoscopy. For the latter procedure, the inside of the subject's nose is sprayed with a
      decongestant, opening the nasal passages. A small flexible tube called a nasoendoscope is
      passed through the nose to the back of the throat. The scope allows observation of the
      larynx while the subject speaks, sings, whistles and makes prolonged vowel sounds.

      Participants are familiarized with the VitalStim device before beginning the experimental
      procedures. The device consists of two sets of electrodes and a stimulation unit. The
      electrodes are placed on the neck and under the chin. Stimulation causes different
      sensations, according to the intensity level. They include ""tingling/crawling,"" ""vibrating""
      ""warm/burning,"" and ""grabbing."" Subjects then undergo the following procedures:

        -  Nasoendoscopy with muscle stimulation: The inside of the nose is sprayed with a
           decongestant and the nasoendoscope is passed through one nostril to the back of the
           throat. Electrodes are placed on the throat area and under the chin. Stimulation is
           delivered 10 times at various places on the neck and under the chin while the subject
           sits quietly. This test shows if the vocal folds in the voice box move with surface
           electrical stimulation.

        -  Videofluoroscopy with muscle stimulation at rest and during swallowing: This is an
           x-ray study of the head and neck during swallowing and at rest to determine how
           stimulation affects the level of the voice box in the neck. Electrodes are placed under
           the chin and on the throat. The subject swallows 5 milliliters of barium, a contrast
           material that can be seen easily on x-ray. The x-ray machine is turned on for a few
           seconds at a time during each swallow of the barium and another 10 times while the
           subject is remaining still without swallowing.

      in its development.

      People between 21 and 80 years of age with adductor spasmodic dysphonia may be eligible for
      this study. Candidates are screened with the following procedures:

      Medical history and physical examination.

      Nasolaryngoscopy to examine the larynx. For this test, the inside of the subject s nose is
      sprayed with a decongestant and a small, flexible tube called a nasolaryngoscope is passed
      through the nose to the back of the throat to allow examination of the larynx. The subject
      may be asked to talk, sing, whistle and say prolonged vowels during the procedure. The
      nasolaryngoscope is connected to a camera that records the movement of the vocal cords
      during these tasks.

      Voice and speech recording to measure the type and severity of voice disorder. Subjects are
      asked questions about their voice disorder and their voice is recorded while they repeat
      sentences and sounds.

      Participants undergo positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      of the brain, as follows:

      PET: A catheter is placed in a vein in the subject s arm to inject a radioactive substance
      called a tracer that is detected by the PET scanner and provides information on brain
      function. [11C]flumazenil is used in one scanning session and [11C]raclopride is used in
      another. For the scan, the subject lies on a bed that slides in and out of the
      doughnut-shaped scanner, wearing a custom-molded mask to support the head and prevent it
      from moving during the scan. For the first scan the subject lies quietly for 60 minutes. For
      the second scan, the subject lies quietly for 50 minutes and is then asked to say sentences
      during another 50 minutes. The amount of radiation received in this study equals to a
      uniform whole-body exposure of 0.9 rem, which is within the dose guideline established by
      the NIH Radiation Safety Committee for research subjects. The guideline is an effective dose
      of 5 rem received per year.

      MRI: This procedure uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves instead of X-rays to obtain
      images of the brain. The subject lies on a table that slides into the scanner, a narrow
      metal cylinder, wearing ear plugs to muffle loud knocking sounds that occur during the scan.
      Images of the brain structure are obtained while the subject lies still in the machine for
      10 minutes. This is followed by functional MRI (fMRI) for 60 minutes, in which pictures are
      taken while the subject speaks, showing changes in brain regions that are involved in speech

NCT00938353,Efficacy of Nebulized Beclomethasone Dipropionate (BDP) in the Treatment of Moderate Croup,"
      Acute laryngotracheobronchitis, better known as croup, is one of the common respiratory
      complaints among children and the most common cause of airway obstruction in children aged
      six months to six years. Patients with croup are typically visited by physicians during two
      peak time periods throughout the year. The first one is in the autumn, usually as a result
      of parainfluenza virus, and the second peak occurs in early winter, a consequence of RSV.
      Croup affects males more commonly than females and affects children between the ages of 6
      months to 6 years. The incidence of croup peaks in children at 2 years of age; croup in
      older children is uncommon, and recurrent episodes are frequently observed.

      Croup symptoms are generally short-lived, with about 60% of children showing resolution of
      their barky cough within 48 h. However, a few children continue to have symptoms for up to 1
      week. Although most children with croup recover without specific treatment, up to 15%
      require hospital admission, and, among those admitted, up to 5% may require intubation.

      Nebulised adrenaline is effective but it has a short duration of action and potentially
      dangerous side effects, and it is therefore not recommended for use in the community in
      mild-moderate Croup.

      Oral and intramuscular steroid treatment, when given in adequate doses in hospital, has been
      shown to be effective for moderate to severe croup in a number of trials and a meta
      analysis.

      It has been suggested that nebulised administration is superior to the oral or intramuscular
      route of administration for a more rapid onset of action and fewer side-effects.

      This study is aimed to demonstrate the effectiveness of nebulised steroid administration as
      beclomethasone dipropionate in croup patients compare to placebo.

NCT01194232,Sildenafil Trial in Children and Young Adults With CF,"
      Cystic Fibrosis (CF), the most common inherited disease in Caucasians, is characterized by
      chronic pulmonary inflammation and progressive loss of gas exchange units that eventually
      results in respiratory failure. There is strong evidence that, in CF, abnormally low
      perfusion carries a high risk of death independent from the presence of pulmonary
      hypertension. However, the evolution of pulmonary vascular disease in CF and how it might
      contribute to the rate of decline in lung function is not known. Our knowledge remains
      limited to the results of old observational studies which concluded that the major causes of
      pulmonary vascular remodeling and hypertension in CF are hypoxic respiratory failure and
      destruction of lung tissue. Our recent data obtained by state-of-the-art Magnetic Resonance
      Imaging (MRI) of the pulmonary circulation, challenges the existing paradigm. We demonstrate
      that in the absence of hypoxia, significant changes in pulmonary perfusion and in surrogate
      measures of vascular resistance as well as in collateral blood flow begin early in the
      course of CF. Newly developed therapeutics have altered dramatically the course of patients
      suffering from pulmonary vascular disease. Through this 8 week trial, we will examine by
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging the effect of Sildenafil on pulmonary perfusion and systemic
      vascularization of the lungs in subjects with mild to moderate disease.

NCT01198210,The Effect of Peritonsillar Infiltration of Ketamine and Dexamethasone for Postoperative Pain Relief in Children Following Adenotonsillectomy,"
      The immediate postoperative period after tonsillectomy, , is often difficult. These children
      frequently have severe pain but postoperative airway edema along with increased sensitivity
      to the respiratory-depressant effects of opioids may result in obstructive symptoms and
      hypoxemia. Opioid consumption may be reduced by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, but
      these drugs may be associated with increased bleeding after this operation.

      Methods: One hundred sixty ASA I-II children 3-12 were randomized four groups of 40 each.
      Group P received a local peritonsillar infiltration of 2 ml saline, group D dexamethsone
      (0.2 mg/kg)) , group K ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) and group KD combination of ketamine0.5mg/kg
      dexamethasone 0.2mg/kg. All medications were 2 ml in volume which was applied 1 ml per
      tonsil 3 min prior to tonsillectomy. Study drugs were marked only with a coded number label.
      A computer-generated table of numbers guided randomization. Modified Hannallah pain scale
      [observational pain scores (OPS)], nausea, vomiting, bleeding, rescue analgesia, sedation
      and Aldrete scores were recorded at first, 15th, 30th and 60th min postoperatively. Patients
      were interviewed on the day after surgery to assess the postoperative pain, nightmares,
      hallucinations, vomiting and bleeding. All the children were premedicated with midazolam
      hydrochloride 0.3 mg/kg) and fentanyl 1micro g/kg intavenously. Anesthesia was induced with
      thiopental 5mg/kg and atracurium0.3mg/kg. Anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane 1.5% and
      nitrous oxide 30% in oxygen. The two surgeon used the same dissection and snare technique
      for all cases and hemostasis done with bipolar cutter. At the end of the surgery
      neuromuscular blockade was reversed by neostigmine 0.03 mg/kg) and atropine 0.01 mg/kg

      room when patients were deep. After extubation the patients were taken to the postanesthesia
      care unit (PACU) where an nurse who were unaware of the study drug observed the patients.
      The pain scoring observer nurse in PACU was consistent. Time to awaken (from the end of
      anesthesia until the patients opened their eyes on command) and time to the first
      administration of postoperative analgesia were recorded. Pethidine in a titrated dose (total
      1 mg/kg) was administered intravenously for rapid pain relief to patients with a OPS score >
      4 or who were crying during two consecutive five minute observation periods until the child
      was comfortable. Postoperative pain during the first 24 h was assessed using a four-point

NCT01249300,Comparison of Ultrasound and Videofluoroscopic Imaging Techniques in Diagnosing Dysphagia in Stroke Patients,"
      Introduction Patients with stroke may be silent aspirators or at risk for laryngeal
      penetration or aspiration because of abnormal oropharyngeal functioning and thus are at risk
      for aspiration pneumonia and its serious effects. By providing identification of the
      components of the abnormal swallow, and comparing swallowing across tasks, the investigators
      may avoid aspiration and can instruct patients on preventative or compensatory swallowing
      techniques.

      Materials and methods

        1. Oral examination-A neurologist and speech pathologist examine the patient's swallowing
           function. The patient is interviewed about difficulties with food intake, chewing and
           swallowing during meals.

        2. Ultrasound examination-Ultrasound creates image of areas inside the body using sound
           waves. With the patient in a sitting position, a 3/4-inch transducer (device for
           transmitting and receiving sound waves) is placed under the chin to visualize
           epiglottis movements during swallowing.

        3. Modified barium swallow-While standing or sitting, the patient swallows 1/2 teaspoon of
           flavored barium (a radioactive substance) six times (a total of 3 teaspoons), while the
           tongue and pharynx (tube leading from the mouth to the esophagus) are scanned and
           videotaped at the same time epiglottis movement will be trace with ultrasound. The
           barium is given in three consistencies-thin, medium and thick (pudding-like).

      The investigators will study the oral, pharyngeal and upper esophageal phases of swallow
      using videofluoroscopy and correlate with ultrasound tracing of epiglottis movement in
      patients with stroke conditions. Most of the previous studies of swallowing have utilized
      diagnostic imaging technique to provide a complete swallowing assessment, but limited
      capabilities for screening large population of patients.

      INCLUSION CRITERIA: The Stroke Center inpatients and outpatients with known or suspected
      dysphagia can be included for study as well as patients who are admitted specifically for
      this protocol. (Difficulty swallowing food or pills,changed swallowing ability,coughing or
      choking when eating, shortness of breath during swallowing, food backing up into the mouth
      or nasal passage, fever or voice changes after swallowing, pain when swallowing, unexplained
      loss of weight.

      EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Patients who are severely demented or severely compromised will be
      excluded if they do not have sufficient cognitive ability to follow directions.
      Non-ambulatory patients will be excluded if they cannot be braced or supported within the
      fluoroscopy unit. Highly agitated individuals will also be excluded if they are unable to
      remain confined in the equipment.

      Analytic Methods The Student t test will be used to analyze the difference in epiglottis
      movements during swallowing amongst different phases. Levene's test for equality of
      variances will be applied to examine the variability of epiglottis movements during
      swallowing between the groups. All statistical analysis will be performed with SPSS.

      A laryngeal mask airway (""LMA"") is an airway device that is commonly used and placed under

      is similar to an ""endotracheal tube"" (a breathing tube) but is less invasive. It is also
      placed as a backup when the Anesthesiologist is unable to pass a breathing tube and the
      patient is not adequately ventilating. Unfortunately, an LMA may lead to complications
      similar to those of breathing tube placement, such as sore throat and hoarse voice. Previous
      studies have examined several variables that may affect how often complications occur; these
      variables include giving anti-inflammatory medications and inflating the LMA to different
      pressures (the ""working"" end of the LMA, which rests in the patient's throat, has a cuff

NCT01817907,The Effects of Trazodone on Sleep Apnea Severity,"
      In Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), the upper airway closes over and over again during sleep.
      This leads to disrupted sleep (waking up during the night), daytime sleepiness, and an
      increased risk for developing high blood pressure. Currently, the best treatment for
      obstructive sleep apnea is sleeping with a mask that continuously blows air into the nose
      (i.e. Continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP] treatment). While CPAP treatment stops the
      upper airway from closing in most people, many people have difficulty sleeping with the mask
      in place and therefore do not use the CPAP treatment. This research study is being conducted
      to learn whether using a sedative will improve OSA severity by altering some of the traits
      that are responsible for the disorder.

NCT01833676,To Compare Effect of Sevoflurane Versus Desflurane on the Return of Swallowing Reflexes in the Elderly,"
      Anaesthesia and surgery has become more common in the elderly as the population survives
      longer. Anaesthesia in the elderly confers a higher risk which is related to the aging
      process and the diseases that accompany seniority. As such, there is a need to provide
      optimal anaesthetic management in order to minimize complications and risks perioperatively.
      One of the changes associated with ageing is the progressive decrease in protective
      laryngeal reflexes. Any depression of upper airway reflexes increases the chance of
      pulmonary aspiration and compromises the maintenance of the airway.

      Desflurane is an inhalational agent strongly favored due to its lower solubility in blood,
      lean tissue and fat as compared to sevoflurane. This enables the agent to be quickly
      eliminated at the end of surgery, with minimal metabolic breakdown, thus facilitating more
      rapid emergence as compared to sevoflurane anesthesia in elderly undergoing general
      anaesthesia. McKay et al conducted a study in 2005 in US, which showed that the choice of
      inhalational agent itself can influence the return of protective airway reflexes. In the
      study, the inhalational agent sevoflurane was found to cause significant impairment of
      swallowing, in comparison with desflurane(1). However, the aforementioned study focussed on
      the general population. As such, the purpose of this study is to determine whether the
      choice of inhalational anesthetic (sevoflurane versus desflurane) has similar influence on
      the return of protective airway reflexes in the geriatric population in Malaysia, and
      whether the significance is greater in the elderly population.

NCT02264353,The Impact of Arousal Threshold in Obstructive Sleep Apnea,"
      The investigators hypothesis is that obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients with a low
      arousal threshold may wake up too early during a respiratory event, before upper airway
      muscles can be activated to achieve stable ventilation. Thus, strategies to manipulate the
      respiratory arousal threshold could potentially improve the quality of sleep and sleep
      disordered breathing. Agents that raise arousal threshold are therefore likely to benefit
      some patients with OSA. The overall goal of this project is to determine the importance of
      the arousal threshold in OSA, determine which patients might benefit from a raised arousal
      threshold, and test this hypothesis by using pharmacological manipulation of the arousal
      threshold to achieve this goal.

NCT02264392,US Guided Versus BlindI&D for Treatment of Soft Tissue Abscesses in the ED,"
      Standard treatment for a soft tissue abscess involves incision over the area of maximum
      fluctuance with drainage of purulence from the abscess cavity. The use of bedside ultrasound
      to guide this drainage has the potential to improve treatment outcomes by ensuring complete
      drainage of the cavity.

      Our hypothesis is that the use of ultrasound for guidance of incision and drainage of soft
      tissue abscesses will decrease treatment failure rate compared to standard blind incision
      and drainage.

      This hypothesis will be tested utilizing a blinded, randomized trial comparing standard
      incision and drainage to ultrasound guided incision and drainage.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of Family Nurture Intervention in
      preschool aged children between 2.5 and 4 years of age who were born prematurely and exhibit
      developmental deficits. The new approach is based on improving aspects of maternal nurturing
      behaviors as well as mother-child co-regulation, which are important to early development.
      Since young children with developmental deficits are often easily upset, mothers will be
      taught how to co-regulate with their child through comfort and calming interactions during 6
      clinic visits. Assessments in the follow-up clinic will test the immediate and long-term
      effects of this new approach to the nurture of children who were born early and demonstrate

NCT02428478,Effect of Desipramine on Genioglossus Muscle Activity in Healthy Adults Study A,"
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is common and has major health implications but treatment
      options are limited. OSA patients show a marked reduction in upper airway (UA) dilator
      muscle activity at sleep onset and this phenomenon leads to increased collapsibility of UA
      compared to normal subjects. Until recently, the search for medicines to activate pharyngeal
      muscles in sleeping humans has been discouraging. However, exciting new animal research has
      shown that drugs with noradrenergic and antimuscarinic effects can restore pharyngeal muscle
      activity to waking levels. In this protocol the investigators will test the effect of

NCT00001716,Effects of Nitric Oxide and Nitroglycerin in Patients With Sickle Cell Anemia,"
      Sickle cell anemia is the most common genetic disease affecting African-Americans. About 1
      in every 1000 African-Americans has the disease and 1 in every 12 carry the genes that could
      be passed on to their children. People with sickle cell anemia have abnormal hemoglobin, the
      molecules responsible for carrying oxygen in the blood. The abnormal hemoglobin can cause
      damage to the red blood cells. The damaged red blood cell may then stick in the blood
      vessels and cause pain and injury to organs. Some of the complications caused by the
      sticking of blood cells are called acute pain crisis and acute chest syndrome (ACS).

      Nitric oxide (NO) is a gas that has been proposed as a possible therapy for the ACS
      complication of sickle cell anemia. Studies have shown that NO may favorably affect sickle
      cell hemoglobin molecules, thereby improving blood flow through small vessels.

      This study is designed to evaluate the effects of NO, when taken in combination with a drug
      called nitroglycerin on patients with sickle cell anemia and normal volunteers. The effects
      of these two drugs only last while the patient is receiving them. Researchers hope the
      information learned from this study will help to develop new therapies for sickle cell

      This study will evaluate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI ) methods for measuring changes in
      the brain's blood flow during hypercapnia (a condition of excess carbon dioxide in the
      blood). MRI is a diagnostic tool that uses a large magnet and radio waves to produce images
      of the body without X-rays.

      Healthy normal volunteers in this study may have as many as six MRI scans over a 2-year
      period. For this procedure, the person lies on a stretcher placed in a strong magnetic field
      produced by the MRI machine. During the scan, the person's blood carbon dioxide (CO2 )
      levels will be increased either by: 1) breathing air mixtures containing up to 5% CO2; or 2)
      receiving an intravenous (I.V.) injection of a drug called acetazolamide.

      Persons who breathe CO2 will have their heart rate, blood pressure and oxygen levels
      monitored throughout the procedure. Those receiving acetazolamide will have the drug
      injected intravenously (I.V.) into an arm vein. If the volunteer experiences any unpleasant
      side effects from the CO2 or acetazolamide, the study will be stopped.

      The information gained from this study will be used to develop better ways to study brain

NCT00006318,Role of Prostaglandins in the Regulation of Brain Blood Flow,"
      This study will use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to examine the role of prostaglandins-a

      results will provide information on how to better use this technique to study brain
      function, which, in turn, may lead to a better understanding of certain illnesses and more
      effective treatments.

      Healthy normal volunteers 18 years of age and older may be eligible for this study.
      Participants will fill out a health questionnaire and undergo a history, physical
      examination and MRI studies. MRI is a diagnostic tool that uses a strong magnetic field and
      radio waves instead of X-rays to show structural and chemical changes in tissues. During the
      scanning, the subject lies on a table in a narrow cylinder containing a magnetic field. An
      intercom system allows the subject to speak with the staff member performing the study at
      all times during the procedure. Four separate studies will be done-two carbon dioxide
      inhalation studies and two functional activation studies-as follows:

      Carbon dioxide inhalation (indomethacin): This study is done in two parts. In both parts, an
      MRI brain scan is done. During the scan, the subject inhales an air mixture containing 6%
      carbon dioxide through a facemask or mouthpiece. Blood pressure and heart rate are monitored
      during inhalation of the mixture. For the second part of the study, indomethacin-a
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-is injected through a catheter (thin flexible tube) in
      an arm vein. Indomethacin inhibits prostaglandin production. Total scan time averages
      between 45 and 90 minutes, with a maximum of 2 hours.

      Carbon dioxide inhalation (rofecoxib and celecoxib): This study is identical to the one
      above, except either rofecoxib or celecoxib is given instead of indomethacin. Both of these
      drugs are also non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that inhibit prostaglandin production.
      Unlike indomethacin, rofecoxib and celecoxib are given orally instead of through a vein, so,
      to allow time for the drug to be absorbed, the second scan is delayed for 2 hours.

      Functional activation (indomethacin): This study is done in two parts. In both parts, a MRI
      brain scan is done. During the study, the subject performs a simple motor task, such as
      finger tapping. For the second part of the study, indomethacin is injected through a
      catheter in an arm vein.

      Functional activation (rofecoxib and celecoxib): This study is identical to the indomethacin
      functional activation study, except either rofecoxib or celecoxib is given instead of
      indomethacin. Because they are given orally instead of through a vein, the second scan is
      delayed 2 hours to allow time for the drug to be absorbed.

NCT00287378,Effect of Ozone on Airway Inflammation in Allergic Asthmatics Treated With Omalizumab,"
      Ozone can cause acute airway inflammation in both asthmatics and normal volunteers. However,
      in asthmatics ozone can cause episodes of worsening of asthma. We want to learn if chronic
      allergic response, known as ""IgE-induced airway inflammation"" is what causes the increased
      inflammation in response to ozone. To do this we will examine the response to ozone in a
      group of asthmatics treated with omalizumab, a medicine available and approved for use in
      people with asthma, or a placebo control. The placebo for this study is inert physiologic
      saline (""salt water"") which contains no omalizumab. Both the omalizumab and the placebo will
      be administered as an injection under the skin. Omalizumab, also called Xolair, is a
      humanized monoclonal antibody, which means that it originally was produced in mice, then
      genetically engineered to look more like human than mouse antibody. Omalizumab inactivates
      IgE, a protein our own immune systems make as part of allergic reactions. The purpose of
      this study is to test the hypothesis that omalizumab, by blocking this aspect of allergic
      reactions, will decrease the number of inflammatory cells in the airway after ozone
      challenge. We also hypothesize that omalizumab will decrease the effects of ozone on changes
      in lung function, mucociliary clearance (a measure of how quickly mucus clears form the
      airway) and airway reactivity. Airway reactivity is a measure of how sensitive the airways
      are to a medication used to diagnose asthma, called methacholine. We will examine these as
      additional information we can learn during the course of the study. This is a blinded study,
      meaning that neither you nor the researchers know if you get the active drug or placebo, but
      that information can be obtained if needed. The placebo is an injection of inert
      physiological saline (""salt water"") which contains no omalizumab.

      in New Orleans post-Hurricane Katrina affect symptoms in children with asthma. It will also
      determine if having an asthma counselor (AC) can reduce a child s asthma symptoms in this
      setting. An AC helps the families in the study obtain appropriate health care, medicines and
      social services for their asthmatic child and instructs them about avoiding allergens and
      ridding allergens from the home.

      Children between 4 and 12 years of age living in Orleans Parish or surrounding areas
      impacted by flooding who have moderate to severe asthma may be eligible for this study.

      Parents provide a family medical history and information about the child s asthma symptoms,
      medications and medical history. The children undergo the following procedures:

        -  Medical examination and blood tests

        -  Spirometry (for children 6 and older) or peak flow (for children under 6) test: For
           spirometry, the child wears a nose clip and breathes into a mouthpiece attached to a
           machine that measures how fast air moves out of the child s lungs. For the peak flow
           meter test, the child blows into a plastic tube after taking a deep breath.

        -  Allergy skin testing: 24 common allergens are applied to the arm by little pricks or
           scratches and the skin is observed for reactions to the allergens.

      Study staff visit the participants homes three times during the 1-year study to test for
      moisture, mold and other allergens. After the first visit, families are randomly assigned to
      one of two groups. Group 1 participants attend two educational group sessions about asthma
      and then three individual sessions. An AC visits the home one time during the study to
      instruct the family on how to use supplies provided to reduce allergens in the home. Group 2
      participants have an individual special teaching meeting with the AC at the end of the
      study. After the meeting, the AC visits the home to instruct the family on use of the
      supplies.

      Families are surveyed by phone every 3 months during the study to answer questions about the
      child s asthma attacks, medicines used, doctor visits, school days, missed, or work days
      missed to care for the child. At the end of the study, the child has a final medical

NCT00660322,Using the Telephone to Improve Care in Childhood Asthma,"
      Asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood and a major cause of morbidity in the
      United States. If asthma symptoms are controlled, a child with asthma can stay well and lead
      a normal life. Daily use of inhaled steroids controls symptoms and reduces morbidity and
      emergent health care utilization in children with persistent asthma, and is safe for
      long-term use. However, inhaled steroids are underused in community asthma care.

      The Telephone Asthma Program (TAP) is a series of brief, telephone calls with a trained
      coach to help the parent manage the child's asthma care. The coach will teach
      self-management skills, help the parent to use the child's asthma medicines effectively,
      provide support and remind the parent to go for follow-up care with the pediatrician. We
      hypothesized that the Telephone Asthma Program will reduce the incidence of acute
      exacerbations of asthma that require emergent care, improve the quality of life of children
      with asthma and their parents, and increase the daily use of inhaled steroids in children
      with persistent asthma. We evaluated the Telephone Asthma Program in a randomized controlled
      trial involving 362 children aged 5 to 12 years old cared for by community pediatricians.

NCT00731575,Viral Inception of Asthma: Prospective Study From Infancy to School-age,"
      The purpose of this study is to study prospectively the early clinical and immunological
      events in children susceptible to rhinovirus induced early wheezing (i.e., recently found
      highest risk factor for recurrent wheezing/asthma) and the efficacy of systemic
      corticosteroid to modify these events.

      Up to 50% of children suffer from acute wheezing before school-age. The prevalence of
      childhood asthma is 5-7%. Although pediatric asthma is mainly allergic, the exacerbations
      are associated with respiratory viral infections in 95% of cases. The means to predict
      asthma from environmental factors have been limited mainly to sensitization to aeroallergens
      (3-fold risk), which start to develop usually at 2-3 years of age. VINKU 1-study (orig.
      VINKU-study) discovered simultaneously with two other groups, that early wheezing associated
      with rhinovirus, the ""common cold"" virus, is the strongest predictor of recurrent
      wheezing/asthma (up to 10-fold risky). Noteworthily, viral infections work as risk markers
      already during infancy, a lot earlier than the sensitization to aeroallergens. The
      investigators also found retrospectively that early wheezers affected by rhinovirus
      responded to 3 day course of oral prednisolone (inexpensive and widely available treatment):
      recurrent wheezing decreased by 50% during following 12 months and the difference appeared
      to continue. VINKU 5V-study is currently investigating the clinical history, prevalence of
      asthma and airway hyperreactivity of these same children at school-age. The mechanism of
      rhinovirus associated risk or why they respond to prednisolone are largely unknown. However,
      the susceptibility to rhinovirus infections is associated with atopy and therefore it is
      possible these children may have impaired anti-inflammatory (Treg) responses and more likely
      to wheeze with any pro-inflammatory response (Th1 or Th2). Moreover, they may not
      effectively clear viruses, because they can not limit rhinovirus to nose and it spreads to
      lower airways and causes wheezing. VINKU 2-study will prospectively investigate the
      immunological events in young first-time wheezers affected by rhinovirus, and prospectively
      study the clinical efficacy of systemic corticosteroid in them. Most likely these children
      will benefit from the drug in terms of less recurrent wheezing, the investigators will also
      explore immunological effects of the drug and their link to clinical efficacy. The results
      are expected to give basis for the prevention of asthma and for the development of new
      treatment strategies and they can be directly applied to clinical medicine.

NCT00860418,Pediatric Asthma Alert Intervention for Minority Children With Asthma,"
      Young inner-city children with asthma have the highest emergency department (ED) visit
      rates. Relying on the emergency department for asthma care can be a dangerous sign of poorly
      controlled asthma. This research will focus on whether having a specialized asthma nurse
      join the family at a child's doctor visit after an ED visit for asthma to make sure the
      child and parent keep the follow-up appointment and have the nurse remind the child's doctor
      to prescribe preventive asthma medicines and an asthma action plan for home (PAAL
      intervention) will result in young children with asthma having fewer days with wheezing and
      cough.

      The investigators hypothesize that:

        1. Significantly more children receiving the PAAL intervention will attend greater than 2
           non-urgent visits and greater than 6 refills for the child's anti-inflammatory
           medications over 12 months when compared to children in the control or standard asthma
           education group.

        2. Children in the PAAL intervention group will experience less morbidity and caregivers
           will experience increased quality of life compared to children in the control of

      The highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus arrived in the Middle East in 2005
      and has since established itself in local domestic birds and is now considered endemic in
      several Middle Eastern countries.Few studies indicate the presence of low pathogenicity
      avian influenza (LPAI) viruses of the H9 type among Lebanese poultry and wild birds. These
      studies also provide some evidence suggesting that humans exposed to these sick birds are
      showing elevated antibody titers against these LPAI H9 viruses.

      This study will focus on the following objectives:

        -  To determine the seroprevalence of AI in poultry-exposed and non-exposed human
           populations.

NCT01113489,Assessment of Oxidative Stress Markers in the Upper and Lower Airways of Atopic Children Treated With Nebulized Beclomethasone,"
      Although it is well known that the presence of uncontrolled inflammation in upper airways
      may compromise the control of asthma and may favor the progression of asthma toward more
      severe grades of disease, few studies addressed whether therapies aimed to control both
      upper and lower airway inflammation may be more effective in controlling asthma. Markers of
      oxidative stress and of inflammation such as Nitrotyrosine and IL-5 are increased in the
      airways of children with atopic asthma and correlated with the levels of oral and nasal
      FeNO, and with the grade of atopy. We hypothesize that the treatment with Beclometasone
      nebulized with a facial mask (for treating both upper and lower airways) will be able to
      reduce the production of oxidants as well as of IL5 in both districts thus promoting
      clinical and functional improvements in mild intermittent asthmatic children. The results
      provided by this study will contribute to further clarify the relationship between nasal and

      community stakeholders, and 2) yield reduced asthma morbidity (symptom-free days,
      absenteeism, and emergency room / urgent care use for asthma care). The investigators
      anticipate that enhancing preventive healthcare for young urban children with asthma through

NCT01721291,Inhaler Lung Deposition in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD),"
      Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) experience breathing difficulties
      because the airways deep in their lungs become narrowed. COPD patients use inhaler drugs to
      provide relief from breathlessness. However, current inhalers are inefficient as they
      deliver a 'coarse-mist' of drug-droplets that do not reach the deep airways.

      In our study, we will use an inhaler of 'fine-mist' drug-droplets, tagged with a radioactive
      tracer to track them. We will take images of the lungs to see if the fine-mist droplets
      reach the deep airways, and assess if this improves the breathing capacity in our patients.
      Our research may allow the development of new, more efficient inhalers to improve treatment
      for patients with COPD.

      Studies suggest that lutein and n-3 fatty acids may influence the development of a child's
      brain and may be related to how well children learn. Both lutein and the n-3 fats (also
      known as omega-3 fats) are not made by the body and must be obtained in the diet. The
      investigators are interested to understand the importance of n-3 fats and lutein to child
      brain development. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will make it possible to
      look into the brain from the outside and see which parts of the brain are being used as
      children complete working memory tasks. The investigators will study brain function using
      fMRI among children with different intakes of n-3 fats and lutein.

      Hypothesis:

        1. Children 6 years of age consuming < 25 mg/day DHA and < 400 μg lutein/day will show

NCT01855659,A Single-center Study to Assess Peak Inspiratory Flow (PIF) in Different Stages' COPD Patients by Using the In-check Method.,"
      Peak Inspiratory Flow Rate (PIFR) is defined by the fastest flow rate noted during the
      inspiratory cycle.

      Inhaled medication plays an important role in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease (COPD), with dry powder inhalers (DPIs) increasingly replacing metered dose inhalers
      (MDIs). DPIs are interesting as they do not require the need for coordinate actuation of the
      MDI device with inhalation or the use of a large spacer device 1-3. Several DPIs are
      available for the administration of inhaled corticosteroids, as well as bronchodilators,
      with each of them corresponding to a different type of inhaler (e.g. Diskus®, Turbuhaler®,
      Aeroliser®, etc.). During the inspiratory effort the patient generates a pressure drop with
      a consequent airflow across the DPI. This inspiratory flow has to be high enough to
      disaggregate and adequately disperse the drug powder into an aerosol cloud of drug particles
      and to guarantee an optimal deposition of the medication in the lung. Such peak inspiratory
      flows (PIFs) are not only dependent on a patient's inhalation effort but also on the
      internal resistance of the device.

      It has been shown that optimal deposition of medication with DPIs is not achieved in some
      patients with low inspiratory flow rates, such as children or patients with COPD, especially
      during acute exacerbations. In such conditions the use of a DPI with low internal resistance
      has been suggested, ensuring an optimal deposition despite the lower flow rate. In addition,
      many clinicians are nowadays confronted with an important number of COPD patients who are

NCT02544035,Determining Age Appropriateness of Children's Products and Toys: An Interagency Agreement With the Consumer Product Safety Commission,"
      Background:

      Play during childhood is an important part of healthy development, and children can learn
      many things when they play. Much of the time that children spend playing is with toys.
      However, children at different ages need different types of toys to engage in healthy play.

      Understanding children s play with toys is important to the National Institute of Child
      Health and Human Development (NICHD), and to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission
      (CPSC). The CPSC rates toys that are currently available in the United States for children
      for age appropriateness. NICHD will share the findings of this study with CPSC to aid in
      their toy rating process.

      Objective:

      To categorize traditional and contemporary children s products and toys into age appropriate
      groups.

      Eligibility:

      Healthy children 6 months to 12 years old.

      Their parents.

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with a phone call with the parents.

      Participants will complete surveys online or on paper, and by phone. These will ask about
      demographic facts, behavior, thoughts on parenting and toys, and child development.

      Participants will have 1 study visit. The child will play with toys by himself or herself.
      Then they will play with their parent. A researcher will observe. The sessions will be
      videotaped.

      Children will share their thoughts about the toys by pointing at a smiley face scale.

      Parents will fill out a short survey. Then can choose to participate in a 1-hour focus
      group.

NCT00119509,The IMAP Study Improving Management of Mildly Abnormal Pap Smears,"
      The study compares the psychosocial outcomes of different management strategies for women
      with minor atypia (including ‘HPV effect’) detected on Pap smears: conventional management
      (a repeat Pap smear at 6 months) versus Human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing, a new method
      proposed for the management of minor atypia and the informed choice of either management
      supported by a decision aid.

      The study examines women’s informed preferences for each of these options and compares the
      psychosocial outcomes in women who are or are not given the choice of management.

      HPV DNA testing offers considerable changes to the management of women with minor atypia and
      there is evidence from the USA which suggests that the use of HPV DNA testing as a triage
      strategy is effective for women within this group (Solomon et al 2001). The introduction of
      HPV DNA testing may bring both benefits and harms to women. These harms and benefits are not
      well understood. Examination of the psychosocial outcomes of HPV DNA testing compared to
      conventional management and women’s preferences for each is needed to guide decisions
      concerning HPV DNA testing in cervical screening in Australia and also internationally.

      Human Papilloma virus (HPV) are viruses that cause a common infection of the skin and
      genitals in men and women. Several types of HPV infection are transmitted by sexual activity
      and, in women, can infect the cervix (part of the uterus or womb). This infection often goes
      away by itself, but if it does not go away (this is called persistent infection), it can
      lead in women over a long period of time to cancer of the cervix. If a woman is not infected
      by HPV, it is very unlikely that she will get cervical cancer. This is an observer blind
      follow up study of the study HPV-001, which evaluated the ability of the HPV vaccine to
      prevent HPV infection. The current study invites all of the 1113 subjects in the HPV-001
      study that received all three doses of vaccine/placebo to be enrolled and followed-up for
      several additional years to see if the HPV vaccine prevents HPV-16 and HPV-18 infections and
      to evaluate the safety of the vaccine. Subjects will remain in the same study group as in

NCT00435214,Human Papillomavirus (HPV) and Risk of Cervical Precancer and Cancer,"
      Background:

        -  In most women, HPV infection does not cause symptoms and the infection goes away on its
           own. In a small percentage of women, the HPV infection does not go away and sometimes
           can result in cervical precancer or cancer.

        -  There are several different types of HPV. A better understanding of which types are
           related to cervical precancer and cancer may help guide doctors in clinical management
           of women who test positive for HPV and better understand why some women develop disease
           while others do not.

      Objectives:

        -  To determine whether certain types of HPV are more risky than others and if so, whether
           they warrant separate detection in screening for cervical precancer and cancer.

        -  To determine if lasting infection by different HPV types carry different risk of
           cervical precancer and cancer.

        -  To determine what viral and genetic factors influence the development of cervical
           precancer and cancer.

        -  To evaluate new HPV tests and new biomarkers of cervical cancer risk.

NCT00443313,Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Testing to Improve Cervical Cancer Screening in the Mississippi Delta,"
      Background:

        -  Cancer of the cervix (bottom third of the uterus, or womb) can be prevented by regular
           Pap tests (also called Pap smears), which check for changes in the cells of the cervix.
           Because many women in the United States have regular Pap smears, cervical cancer is not
           common in this country. However, the disease is common among women in the Mississippi
           Delta because of poor participation in screening programs.

        -  The major causes of cervical cancer are persistent human papillomaviruses (HPV)
           infection by cancer-associated HPV types and lack of screening. These viruses cause an
           infection that often goes away by itself, but if it does not go away, over a long time
           lead to cervical cancer. HPV causes cervical abnormalities, which are detected by Pap
           smears and then treated.

      Objectives:

      -To determine whether an at-home self-collection method for obtaining cells from the cervix
      can be a simple, safe and inexpensive way to screen for cervical cancer for women who don t
      go to the health clinic regularly.

        -  Women who reside in the counties of Leflore, Sunflower, Washington or Tallahatchie,
           Mississippi.

        -  Women between 26 and 65 years of age who are not pregnant and who have not had a
           hysterectomy.

      Design:

      Screening study participants undergo the following:

        -  The doctor takes a cervical sample using the same self-collection device that women
           will use at home to self-collect.

        -  Pelvic examination and Pap test. For this test, the woman lies on an exam table and the
           doctor inserts an instrument called a speculum into the vagina, opening it to see the
           cervix. A special brush is used to take a few cells from the cervix. The cells are
           placed on a glass slide and sent to a lab for examination.

        -  Cervical cell specimen collection using an at-home self-collection kit that
           participants will use at home after 2 weeks

        -  At-home self-collection by participant after 2 weeks.

        -  Referral to a doctor for follow-up care, if needed.

        -  Colposcopy (see below) in all women with a Pap test that is abnormal or positive for
           HPV and for some women with a normal smear.

      Colposcopy study participants undergo the following:

        -  The doctor takes a cervical sample using the same self-collection device that women
           will use at home to self-collect.

        -  Colposcopy, an exam in which the doctor examines the cervix using a light and looks
           through a magnifying device to see if there is any abnormal tissue on the cervix.
           During this exam, the doctor may remove a small sample of tissue to diagnose any
           abnormality. Participants also have a sample collected using the self-collection kit.

        -  At-home cervical sample collection by participant after 2 weeks.

NCT01097356,The Effect of Probiotics on the Clearance of the Human Papillomavirus and on Cytological Lesions Caused by the Virus,"
      Aim: In this project proposition the investigators would like to examine the effect of
      immune modulation by probiotics on the clearance of HPV-infections.

      This study provides a model for viral infection but also for cancer precursors. This would
      be an excellent model (and the only possible short-term model) to examine an effect on
      cancer precursors. Cancer precursors (cytological abnormalities such as L-SIL) are a
      scientifically accepted surrogate endpoint for cervical cancer, for example in HPV-vaccine
      studies.

      Research question: Does daily intake of probiotics lead to a better immune-response in
      HPV-infected women, i.e. does it facilitate clearance of the virus and/or regression of
      cytological lesions?

NCT01131312,Randomized Clinical Trial on Clinical Management of ASCUS and LSIL (ALTS),"
      Approximately 65 million Pap smears are performed each year in the United States. The vast
      majority of results are negative (no abnormality identified) but about 5 percent to 8
      percent are reported as abnormal. Most low-grade changes regress spontaneously; only a
      minority of such lesions would progress to a cancer precursor without treatment. However,
      there is no way to determine morphologically which patients are at risk or progression.
      Therefore, both high- and low-grade lesions were often managed with colposcopy and directed
      biopsy. It was anticipated that determining alternative management strategies would yield
      important potential benefits including fewer medical complications from over treatment,
      reduced patient anxiety associated with referral for cytologic abnormalities, as well as
      cost savings.

      Epidemiologic, virologic and molecular studies have clearly demonstrated that human
      papillomavirus (HPV) is the central cause of cervical cancer. The motivation for the ALTS
      trial was to use the information we have gained about the role of HPV to design better
      treatment and prevention strategies to reduce the burden of cervical cancer and its
      precursors.

      ALTS consisted of three management strategies: (1) immediate colposcopy of all women; (2)
      repeat cytology with colposcopy only if the results show a high grade lesion; and (3) HPV
      testing and repeat cytology in combination, with referral to colposcopy if either the HPV
      test is positive or the cytology shows a high grade lesion. Four Clinical Centers University
      of Alabama, Birmingham AL; Magee-Womens Hospital, Pittsburgh PA; University of Oklahoma,
      Oklahoma City OK; and University of Washington, Seattle WA enrolled approximately 5,000
      women with recent diagnosis of ASCUS or LSIL. Participants were followed at six month
      intervals for a total of 2 years. The main results from ALTS showed that for women with
      ASCUS cytology, HPV triage was at least as safe as universal immediate colposcopy in the
      detection of high-grade lesion and would allow approximately half of women to return to
      routine follow up without additional procedures (colposcopy). No efficient triage strategy
      was identified for women with LSIL cytology.

      The ALTS database and ALTS specimens continue to be a valuable research resource in studies
      of cervical cancer precursors, screening tests, visual assessment of the cervix and
      investigation of biomarkers.

NCT01231945,Low-Cost Molecular Cervical Cancer Screening Study,"
      Background:

      - Low-cost molecular human papillomavirus (HPV) testing may offer a more robust alternative
      to Pap smears and visual inspection for cervical cancer screening of underserved women. Two
      low-cost molecular tests for human HPV, the HPV E6 Test and the careHPV test, have been
      developed to detect cervical cancer by testing for HPV DNA. These tests take between 2 and 3
      hours to run and may provide point-of-care (diagnostic testing at or near the site of
      patient care) testing for HPV. Researchers are interested in evaluating both tests to
      determine the best strategy for HPV testing of women who live in rural or underserved areas
      that have a high prevalence of cervical cancer diagnoses.

      Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the clinical performance of the HPV E6 Test and careHPV in detecting
           cervical cancer and precancerous lesions.

        -  To evaluate the best low-cost test or combination of tests for women who have been
           referred for cervical cancer screening or treatment.

        -  To compare the clinical performance of self-collected specimens versus
           clinician-collected specimens in detecting cervical cancer and precancerous lesions.

      Eligibility:

      - Women between 25 and 65 years of age who live in rural China.

      Design:

        -  This study involves an initial testing visit and a 1-year followup visit for a
           high-risk subgroup.

        -  Participants will have the HPV E6 test, careHPV, and a visual inspection test for
           cervical cancer. For comparison, participants will also have the standard HPV test
           approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

        -  Participants who test positive for HPV on any of the above tests will also have
           colposcopy to collect samples of cervical tissue for further study.

        -  A random sample of women who test negative for HPV will also have colposcopy.
           Participants may also have biopsies if there is visual evidence of cervical
           abnormalities.

        -  At the 1-year followup visit, participants in the high-risk subgroup will have the same
           tests as in the previous visit..

      25-69, attending for cervical screening or for routine follow-up will be invited to
      participate in the 2-arm trial. A liquid-based cytology (LBC) sample will be taken from

NCT02561208,Evaluation of an Mhealth Intervention to Increase Adherence to Triage of HPV+ Women,"
      Cervical cancer remains a serious health problem, particularly in developing countries. It
      is the leading cause of cancer death among women and mainly affects women of low
      socioeconomic status.

      Evidence has shown that HPV-test self-collection can reduce social and health services
      barriers to screening and increase coverage. However, high coverage will not result in a
      decrease of disease burden if women are not diagnosed/treated. The HPV-test indicates
      whether a woman is positive or not, and a triage test is needed to identify HPV-positive
      women who need to perform diagnostic procedures. Several triage methods are available. In
      Argentina, cytology is used as triage method; therefore, all HPV-positive women who have
      performed self—collection at home need to attend health centers to undergo cytology.
      However, the proportion of women who have completed triage is low, therefore new innovative
      strategies are needed to increase attendance to cytology of these women.

      This study will be carried out in Jujuy, one of the Argentinian provinces with highest
      cervical cancer mortality rates and where HPV- self-collection has been introduced as
      programmatic strategy for screening under-users.

      This trial is population-based cluster-randomized study that aims to evaluate the
      effectiveness of a mHealth intervention versus usual care to increase adherence to
      cytological triage among women with HPV-positive self-collected tests.

      An overall number of 240 Community Health Workers (CHWs) from the Primary Health Care System
      (PHCS) of the Province of Jujuy will be randomized into two groups:

        1. mHealth Intervention Group: Women with HPV self-collected tests will receive a mixed
           intervention which includes counseling through an interactive Apps specifically devised
           to increase adherence to triage which will be run on a tablet, and SMS text messages to
           remind them to attend triage. In addition, Heads of CHWs, chiefs of gynecology services
           and CHWs will receive reminders via e-mails and SMS message to contact women if after
           60 days from the HPV-results HPV+ they have not performed triage.

        2. Usual Care Group: Women with HPV self-collected tests receive usual care.

      A database built specifically for the study will be used; it will include data about
      randomization Group, agreement to participate in the study and socio-demographic data. Data
      on HPV-testing and triage will be uploaded importing the data from SITAM, using the Unique
      Identification Number (DNI).

      Data Analysis

      Effectiveness to enhance adherence to cytological triage: Adherence to triage will be
      considered for each CHW. This will be defined as the number of women with triage smears
      within 30, 60 and 90 days. There will be a comparison of the percentage of HPV-positive
      women that did the Pap test within those time intervals in the mHealth intervention group

      infarction. Several recent clinical trials with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors
      (ACEI) have shown that they also reduce the incidence of myocardial infarction, but the
      mechanisms underlying this anti-ischemic effect are poorly understood. ACEI reduce
      angiotensin II synthesis and prevent bradykinin degradation. Results from ongoing studies in
      the Cardiology Branch (Protocol 95-H-0099) designed to investigate the link between ACEI and
      the vascular endothelium indicate that ACEI improve peripheral endothelial function, an
      effect that is partially mediated by bradykinin. The current protocol is designed to
      investigate whether the beneficial effects of ACEI on peripheral endothelial function are

      Heart failure is very common in the elderly, in whom it may lead to functional and
      intellectual problems. Functional problems include loss in the ability to perform basic
      tasks of daily living such as bathing or dressing. No studies have yet described the rate at
      which heart failure causes these problems to develop. This study aims to find out whether
      nursing home patients deteriorate more quickly with respect to function and intellect if
      they have heart failure. Participants will undergo a thorough health history and physical
      examination and will be followed every 3 months for up to a year. Over 30 nursing homes in
      Kitchener, Waterloo, Cambridge, and Hamilton, in South Central Ontario (Canada), are

NCT00208806,Resynchronization Therapy in Young Patients With and Without CHD,"
      Pacemakers can be attached to one or more than one of the heart chambers. After watching
      pacemakers work over time, doctors have found that the pacemakers that stimulate only one
      chamber of the heart sometimes lead to problems later. These problems may be changes in the
      size and shape of the heart. The heart cannot work as well when some of these changes
      happen. We need to learn more about these changes and how to prevent them. There has not
      been an easy way to do this. A new treatment called Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT)
      is associated with biventricular pacing where two chambers of the heart are stimulated
      simultaneously. Tissue Doppler Imaging,Tissue Synchronization Imaging and 3 dimensional
      echocardiography are new forms of technology that look at the heart while it works. They are
      similar to a moving x-ray that can watch the heart muscles moving. The movement can be
      measured. Doctors will check for changes that happen over time. This has not been studied in
      children before because this kind of is new to this group of patients. This technology is
      noninvasive which means it can be done from the outside of the body and is painless.

      The hearts of children grow fast. It is important to be able to know if the pacemaker or
      problems from dilated cardiomyopathy are causing any changes in the heart that might cause
      problems. We expect to be able to use information we learn from this study to improve how we
      use pacemakers in the future to avoid problems that can happen over time.

      Recently, heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction (HFNEF) was found in up to 50% of

NCT00597077,Atrial Fibrillation and Congestive Heart Failure Trial,"
      Heart failure is a clinical syndrome where the heart is unable to pump enough blood to
      satisfy the organism's metabolic needs. Heart failure has become a major clinical and public
      health problem with approximately 300,000 Canadians being affected. Atrial fibrillation is a
      rhythm disorder in which the upper chambers of the heart (the atria) are paralyzed by
      continuous electrical activity. Some of the continuous chaotic electrical activity in the
      atria travels to the lower cavities of the heart (the ventricles) causing then to beat
      irregularly and very rapidly. It is the most frequent cardiac arrhythmia, affecting 5% of
      individuals 65 years and older and it is associated with an increased risk of stroke. Both
      conditions (heart failure and atrial fibrillation) often co-exist in the same patient. Heart
      failure promotes atrial fibrillation and atrial fibrillation aggravates heart failure. The
      Atrial Fibrillation and Congestive Heart Failure (AF-CHF) trial is investigating whether
      preservation of normal cardiac rhythm influences mortality and morbidity. The AF-CHF study

NCT00767195,Power Spectral Analysis of Breath Sound in Pulmonary Edema,"
      Pulmonary edema can be classified into ""cardiogenic pulmonary edema"" and ""non-cardiogenic
      pulmonary edema"" according to the underlying etiology. Cardiogenic pulmonary edema is caused
      by the dysfunction in the cardiac pumping capability, leading to the transudation
      accumulation in the pulmonary peri-capillary space. The predisposing factors of
      non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema are numerous, including severe infection, renal failure,
      auto-immun reaction, etc. The mortality rate of pulmonary edema is relatively high,
      especially the non-cardiogenic one. To distinguish the type of pulmonary edema at the early
      stage is important for its treatment.

      Lung sound analysis via stethoscope is a simple diagnostic method to lung diseases
      clinically. Among many kinds of lung sounds, the ""crackle"" and ""rale"" are frequently found
      in pulmonary edema. ""Rale"" is also called ""moist rale"". It is considered as low-frequency
      wheezes and is often seen in cardiogenic pulmonary edema. On the other hand, ""crackle"" is
      also called ""dry rale"", which is a kind of high-frequency wheezes and usually seen in Acute
      Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) that is classified into non-cardiogenic pulmonary
      edema.

      This proposed project intends to establish a digital diagnostic method for pulmonary edema.
      The lung sound of patient with pulmonary edema will be collected by the lung sound
      acquisition system. By identifying the significant spectrum characteristics of cardiogenic
      pulmonary edema and non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, the diagnostic system might be

      not pump as well, this reflex is exaggerated. The result is a vicious circle: blood CO2
      levels fluctuate wildly and as a result breathing also fluctuates with patients
      hyperventilating at times and briefly stopping breathing at others. During sleep this is
      called central sleep apnoea (CSA).

      Patients with CSA wake up throughout the night and whilst some patients are oblivious to
      this, others are consciously breathless and many patients are tired during the day and feel
      unable to perform their daily activities.

      As part of the body's stress response to the erratic pattern of breathing, both blood
      pressure and heart rate may rise to a level that is harmful in a failing heart, exacerbating
      the underlying heart failure. Indeed patients who demonstrate this CSA die sooner than those
      who have heart failure and stable breathing.

      There are no proven specific therapies for CSA that stabilise breathing, improve sleep
      quality, and prolong life. We have designed a system which delivers very small doses of CO2,
      when the blood level of CO2 is predicted to be low. During short daytime recordings, using
      this system, we have demonstrated that it is possible to stabilise the body's CO2 levels.

      We aim to test what happens when CO2 is given overnight whilst the patient is sleeping to
      see whether we can stabilise their breathing over longer durations and whether sleep quality
      could be improved so that patients are less tired during the day. In addition, we would like
      to measure whether the stress response is lessened if the breathing is successfully
      stabilised.

NCT01148719,Triage of Reduced Exercise Tolerance in Frail Elderly,"
      Background of the study:

      Many elderly suffer from reduced exercise tolerance or exercise induced shortness of breath
      (dyspnoea) which causes decreased mobility and restrictions in physical, psychological and
      social functioning. Patients commonly attribute this symptom to their age, and simply adjust
      their life style to it. Reduced exercise tolerance/dyspnoea is very common with prevalence
      rate of 20-60% of those aged 65 years and over. The main causus in the elderly are heart
      failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Both diseases have a high negative
      impact on the quality of life and are associated with frequent hospital admissions.
      Over-diagnosis, but more often under-diagnosis of heart failure and COPD is rather common in
      primary care. Establishing a diagnosis early in the course of the disease is useful because
      both diseases can be adequately and evidence-based treated. Therefore, an easy diagnostic
      triage-strategy followed bij direct treatment would be of great importance to asses and
      treat heart failure and COPD in elderly patient with shortness of breath.

      Objective of the study:

      Quantify how many frail elderly aged over 65 years with reduced exercise tolerance and/or
      exercise induced dyspnoea have previously unrecognised COPD and heart failure. Quantify the
      difference in prevalence of unrecognised COPD and heart failure between those who underwent
      the diagnostic triage compared to those who received care as usual. Quantify the effect of
      the diagnostic triage plus the additionally treatment changes on functionality and quality
      of life after 6 months compared to those who received care as usual. Quantify the
      cost-effectiveness of the diagnostic triage strategy compared to care as usual

      Study design:

      A clustered randomized diagnostic (follow-up) study

      Study population:

      First, pre-selection of patients aged over 65 years from 50 general practices is based on
      frailty. Frailty is based on the next criteria: use 5 or more different types of medical
      drugs chronically in the last year and/or have 3 or more chronic or vitality treating
      diseases (such as diabetes mellitus, COPD, heart failure, impaired vision). This will be
      done from the electronic medical files of the general practices. These elderly will receive
      the MRC questionnaire of dyspnoea and three additional questions related tot exercise
      intolerance. Those with any dyspnoea and/or reduced exercise tolerance will be invited to
      participate, except those with established heart failure and COPD.

      Study parameters/outcome of the study:

      Prevalence of latent heart failure and COPD. Difference in prevalence of latent heart
      failure and COPD between both groups.

      Differences in functionality and quality of life after 6 months between both groups.

NCT01294111,Tai Chi Training for Elderly People With Chronic Heart Failure,"
      Physical activity is recommended in the treatment of heart failure. Elderly people demand
      various forms of physical activity. Tai chi has shown to be an appreciated form of physical
      activity among elderly, although there is a lack of studies focusing people aged 70 years
      and older.

      The overall goal with the project is to find a form of physical activity that is safe and
      free from side effects, suitable for elderly people with chronic heart failure. The
      hypothesis is that for patients participating in tai chi training during three months the
      degree of self rated fatigue will be reduced and health-related quality of life will
      increase, compared with a control group receiving ordinary care. The primary aim is to study
      the effect of tai chi training on fatigue and health-related quality of life. A second aim
      is to study effects on physical function and levels of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) in
      blood plasma. A tertiary aim is to describe the experience of participating in tai chi
      training.

      A randomized controlled clinical study is planned. Ninety patients with a verified diagnosis
      of heart failure in the age of 70 years or older, who experience fatigue according to the
      Multi Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20), will be randomized to intervention or control group. Three
      groups with 15 participants each will complete a tai chi training programme twice-weekly for
      16 weeks. Data will be collected at baseline, directly after the 16 weeks of training, and 6
      and 12 months thereafter. The programme is worked out by an expert in Chinese traditional
      medicine to suit elderly people with chronic heart failure, and the classes are led by
      experienced leaders. Before the start of the study a small pilot study was conducted to test
      the feasibility of the programme. A group of seven patients completed the programme for
      eight weeks without any problems.

      If tai chi has a good effect on fatigue, health-related quality of life and physical
      function, this form of physical activity can be a valuable complement to other medical
      treatment. Tai chi has a potential to be offered to many patients to a relatively low cost.
      It can be practiced in groups or in private, and also through internet connection.

NCT01307722,Left Atrial Distensibility Guiding Management in Advanced Chronic Heart Failure,"
      Background and Purpose- According to our prior studies, left atrial (LA) distensibility was
      associated significantly with left ventricular filling pressure in patients with acute
      myocardial infarction (AMI), chronic stable angina, and severe mitral regurgitation. LA
      distensibility can be used as noninvasive Swan-Ganz catheter. Additionally, it could predict
      in-hospital mortality in AMI patients. In the current study, left atrial distensibility
      guiding management in advanced chronic heart failure will be performed to assess whether
      those management could influence long-term prognosis including mortality rate,
      rehospitalization rate and the duration of rehospitalization.

      Materials and Methods- Advanced chronic heart failure (HF) is defined as left ventricular
      ejection fraction less than 35%, creatinine less than 2 mg/dL, and CHF NY functional class
      III-IV for more than 3 months. Enrolled patients should be admitted to hospital due to heart
      failure requiring adjustment of inotropic agents or diuretics within recent 6 months. Three
      hundred HF cases will be recruited - 100 with sinus rhythm, and 100 with atrial fibrillation
      served as LA distensibility guided treatment group (guide group) and another 100 patients,
      either sinus rhythm or atrial fibrillation, served as control group. The management of guide
      group will be adjusted by LA distensibility, including the dose of inotropic agents,
      diuretics, beta-blocker, ACEI, and AIIB. Initially, the guide group will be followed 1 time
      per 2 week at first 3 months, then 1 time per month later. The control group will be treated
      by conventional management and traditional echocardiography can be performed as in-charge
      doctor request. The necessity of hospitalization for heart failure will be adjusted by 2
      cardiovascular specialists and all patients admitted for heart failure will be managed by
      the same one cardiovascular specialist (Shih-Hung Hsiao). The total duration of follow-up
      will be 2 years. For life-threatening heart failure, intravenous nitroprusside drip under
      continuous A-line monitor, percutaneous coronary intervention, Swan-Ganz catheter insertion,
      intra-aortic balloon pump, and ECMO can be done according to the order of in-charge doctor.
      The primary end-point will be all-cause mortality. The second end-points will be heart
      failure with hospitalization and the duration of each hospitalization. Additionally, the
      ratios of medication changes in 2-year follow-up, including diuretics, inotropic agents,
      beta blockers, ACEI, and AIIB, will be assessed. Analysis will also be performed to estimate
      the trends of heart function (either systolic or diastolic) and renal function during 2-year
      follow-up according to whether guiding by LA distensibility is done or not.

NCT01519115,Comparison of Outcomes Between Early Physical Therapy Intervention and Usual Care Following Anterior Cervical Fusion Surgery,"
      Background: Early physical therapy (PT) intervention with emphasis on spinal stabilization
      has been shown to benefit individuals undergoing lumbar spinal surgery. Further, training
      cervical spine stabilizers (deep cervical flexors and cervical multifidus) has been shown to
      be effective in reducing neck pain, restoring cervical spinal function and mobility in many
      types of cervical spine dysfunction. However, the training of stabilizers has not been
      studied in individuals undergoing cervical spinal surgery, even though these individuals
      often have problems with residual pain and weakness after the surgery.

      Purpose: The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of clinical outcomes
      between an early PT intervention and usual care in patients who have undergone anterior
      cervical spine fusion (ACF) surgery. A study hypothesis is that outcomes will be improved
      with early PT intervention.

      Methods: This study is a double-blinded randomized clinical trial with a two-factor (2x3)
      research design. The patients following ACF surgery will be randomly assigned in one of the
      two treatment groups: usual care and early intervention. Three outcome measures will be
      collected pre-operative for baseline, and then at 6-week and 12-week post-operative
      follow-up visits, including: (1) deep cervical flexor (DCF) strength as determined by the
      cranio-cervical flexion (CCF) performance test, (2) patient's perceived disability
      associated neck pain as determined by the Neck Disability Index (NDI) questionnaire, and (3)
      neck pain level using the numeric pain rating scale (NPRS). In addition, at 6 and 12 weeks,
      the global rate of change (GROC) scale will be obtained to determine the patient's
      perception of overall improvement as a result of surgery. The investigator performing the
      outcome measures will be blinded to group assignment, and therefore will not participate in
      treatment. After randomization, the usual care group will receive only one visit of PT for
      post-operative instruction. The early intervention group will receive verbal and written
      instructions for posture and training cervical spine stabilizers in addition to the usual
      care. The early intervention group also will be asked to perform these exercises at home and
      keep a log of the exercise.

      Data Analysis: Two 2x3 MANOVAs with repeated measures will be used to examine the
      differences in the CCF strength and the NDI scores between groups and at the three different
      time frames with the α level set at 0.05. Non-parametric tests (Mann-Whitney U tests) will
      be used to compare the differences in the NPRS and GROC data over time and between groups.

NCT01566890,Microvascular Blood Flow in Sickle Cell Anemia,"
      Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited blood disorder that causes the red blood cells to
      change their shape from a round shape to a half-moon/crescent or sickled shape.
      Sickle-shaped cells can cause problems by getting stuck in blood vessels, blocking blood
      flow, and can cause inflammation and injury to important body parts. There are no specific
      treatments that improve this condition and promote blood flow hindered by sickle cell
      blockages. Another big challenge in managing sickle cell disease is that there are no good
      measures to determine changes and improvements in blood flow.

      Contrast-enhanced ultrasound is a technique currently used to detect blood flow in the
      heart, muscles, and other organs. It is extremely sensitive and can detect blood flow in the
      smallest of blood vessels. It would be very useful in helping healthcare providers know
      whether treatment strategies are improving blood flow during sickle cell blockages.

      Purpose: To compare the hemodynamic effects of dobutamine and milrinone in hospitalized
      patients who are receiving Beta Blocker Participants: Patients who are admitted to the
      General Cardiology and Heart Failure Services at the University of North Carolina Hospitals
      with acute decompensated heart failure, who have maintained steady state concentrations of
      beta blocker therapy (carvedilol or metoprolol), and who are deemed by the health care team
      to require pulmonary artery catheter placement and inotropic therapy with dobutamine or
      milrinone by continuous infusion. Patients that are not currently receiving beta blocker
      therapy will be enrolled for comparative purposes; however, any patient not at steady state
      (on or off beta blocker therapy) will not be enrolled.

      Procedures: After obtaining informed consent, patients will be assigned to the appropriate
      sub-study group based on beta blocker use (Study A: patients on stable doses of metoprolol
      and Study B: patients on stable doses of carvedilol). All patients should receive dobutamine
      followed by milrinone as outlined in the dosing algorithm (see inotrope dosing algorithm
      attached, as part of the usual standard of practice). Baseline pulmonary artery catheter
      hemodynamic parameters will be collected prior to administration of inotrope trial of
      dobutamine followed by milrinone. Hemodynamic parameters will be recorded per the dosing
      algorithm following initiation and dose titration. Dose titration will be determined by the
      health care team based upon patient response or lack thereof and tolerability. Changes in
      hemodynamic parameters in response to dobutamine or milrinone will be compared within study
      groups. Additionally, data will continue to be collected on patients receiving not beta
      blocker therapy for comparative purpose.

NCT02203383,The Effect of CRT on the Hypercapnic Ventilatory Response,"
      Central Sleep Apnoea (CSA) affects up to half of patients with severe heart failure and is
      associated with a poor prognosis. CSA is manifest as episodes of deep breathing interspersed
      with very shallow or absent breathing and is largely due to an exaggerated response to
      rising carbon dioxide in the blood, which normally drives how hard we breathe. Cardiac
      Resynchronization therapy (CRT), in which a pacemaker is implanted to improve co-ordinated
      contraction of the heart, has been shown to reduce the severity of CSA in some patient
      groups. We aim to determine whether this improvement is due to normalization of the body's
      response to carbon dioxide in the blood. Our hypothesis is that CRT improves CSA by
      normalizing the brain's response to carbon dioxide.

      Objective:

      The Ultrasonic Cardiac Output Monitor (USCOM) is a non-invasive, quantitative method for
      measuring and monitoring cardiovascular haemodynamic parameters in patients. The aims of
      this study are:

        1. To investigate whether USCOM-derived haemodynamic parameters such as Cardiac output
           (CO), inotropy and oxygen delivery (DO2) have a role in the diagnosis of patients with
           a compensated heart failure syndrome (cHFS) or acute decompensated heart failure
           syndrome (adHFS)

        2. To investigate whether USCOM-derived haemodynamic parameters such as CO, inotropy and
           DO2 correlate with heart failure staging, especially New York Heart Association (NYHA)
           class and American Heart Association (AHA) stage.

        3. To investigate whether USCOM-derived haemodynamic parameters such as velocity time
           interval (vti), stroke volume (SV), CO, SV index (SVI), CO index (CI), inotropy and DO2
           correlate with ejection fraction.

        4. To investigate whether USCOM-derived haemodynamic variables may be used as prognostic
           indicators of 30-day, 6-month and 1-year Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE).

        5. To evaluate the agreement between hemodynamic measurements obtained using the
           Ultrasonic Cardiac Output Monitor (USCOM®; USCOM Ltd., Sydney, Australia), and
           reference standards as determined by 2 Dimensional echocardiography (2D-echo)

      ejection fraction (HFrEF) when compared to similar white cohorts. This study will seek to
      confirm the previous genetic sub-study from AHeFT which suggested a functional polymorphism
      of guanine nucleotide binding protein beta polypeptide 3 subunit (GNB3), C825T in exon 10,
      influences the therapeutic efficacy of FDC I/H. This study will initiate treatment with FDC

      be followed for up to two years on therapy. Clinical outcomes (survival, heart failure
      hospitalizations, and change in quality of life) on FDC I/H will be compared by GNB3
      genotype subset. The hypothesis to be confirmed is that subjects homozygous for the T allele
      (those with the GNB3 TT genotype which is present in approximately 50% of black subjects)

      Introduction: Heart Failure (HF) generates multiple hospital admissions and mortality, which
      are reduced with the administration of Beta-Blocker (BB), Angiotensin Converting Enzyme
      Inhibitor (ACEI), Angiotensin II Receptor Blocker (ARB) and Mineralocorticoid Receptor
      Antagonist (MRA) drugs (Level of Evidence A). The effect is dose-dependent. Nevertheless,
      dosages are suboptimal. European Guidelines 2012 recommend close monitoring and up-titration
      of drugs by HF nurses. Trials are needed to evaluate their effectiveness and safety.
      Objective: To compare doses achieved by patients of BB, ACEI, ARA II and ARM in 4 months ( %
      relative to target doses) in the intervention group (HF nurse) and in the control group (
      cardiologist), adverse events, Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF), New York Heart
      Association (NYHA), 6 min. walking test, quality of life, Nt-proBNP, readmissions and

      (""de novo"") HF patients with LVEF ≤ 40%, NYHA II-III, without contraindications to BB of 17
      Spanish hospitals will be included. Intervention: The cardiologist prescribes drugs and,
      driven by protocol, the HF nurse implements the up-titration. In the control group doses are
      decided by the cardiologist clinical support and education being provided by nurses.

      To evaluate the relative effectiveness and safety of foscarnet versus ganciclovir for the
      treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis in people with AIDS; to evaluate the relative
      effect on survival of the use of these two anti-CMV agents in the treatment of CMV
      retinitis; to compare the relative benefits of immediate treatment with foscarnet or
      ganciclovir versus deferral of treatment for CMV retinitis limited to less than 25 percent
      of zones 2 and 3.

      CMV retinitis is a common opportunistic infection in patients with AIDS. Ganciclovir is
      currently the only drug approved for treatment of CMV retinitis in immunocompromised
      patients. Ganciclovir suppresses CMV infections, and relapse occurs in virtually all AIDS
      patients when ganciclovir is discontinued. Because of their similar hematologic (blood)
      toxicities, the simultaneous use of ganciclovir and zidovudine (AZT) is not recommended.
      More recently the drug foscarnet has become available for investigational use. Studies so
      far indicate that remission of CMV retinitis occurs in 36 to 77 percent of patients, and
      that relapse occurs in virtually all patients when the drug is discontinued. The relative
      effectiveness of foscarnet compared with ganciclovir for the immediate control of CMV
      infections is unknown. Further, the long-term effects of foscarnet or ganciclovir on CMV
      retinitis, survival, and morbidity are unknown. There is also no definitive information on

      AMENDED: 8/8/90. Changes made in neutrophils count from < 500 to < 750 cells/mm3.
      Nonrandomized eyes will not be used for the primary efficacy evaluation.

      ORIGINAL DESIGN: To determine the effectiveness and safety of ganciclovir (DHPG) therapy in
      AIDS patients suffering from active cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection of the retina of the eye
      (retinitis) when the drug is administered directly into the fluid-filled vitreous cavity of
      the eye by injection.

      CMV retinitis is the most frequently seen opportunistic infection of the eye in AIDS
      patients, and left untreated can lead to severe visual loss and blindness. While systemic
      administration of DHPG has been shown to be an effective treatment for CMV retinitis, the
      chronic administration required may be complicated by decreased blood cell counts
      (granulocytopenia) which may require discontinuation of treatment. While withholding
      treatment may allow recovery from the granulocytopenia, interruption of therapy may result
      in reactivation of the retinitis. Injection of DHPG into the vitreous cavity of the eye may
      be of benefit to severely neutropenic patients with CMV retinitis.

      disease in AIDS patients. The manner in which foscarnet breaks down in the body and the
      effect of increasing periodic intravenous doses are also studied. Foscarnet is active in
      vitro (test tube) against herpes viruses, including CMV, by inhibiting the virus DNA
      polymerases, enzymes necessary for virus replication, without affecting cellular DNA
      polymerases. Opportunistic CMV disease in AIDS is usually seen as retinitis, colitis,
      esophagitis, hepatitis, pancreatitis, encephalitis, or pneumonia. Ganciclovir has been used
      to treat AIDS patients with CMV disease but can cause severe neutropenia (very low
      neutrophil cell counts). Foscarnet does not suppress the production of neutrophils or other
      leukocytes (myelosuppression) and has shown in vitro activity against HIV.

      together or alternately; to determine the interactive pharmacokinetics (blood level) profile

      are to examine the effect of these treatments in controlling time to cytomegalovirus (CMV)
      retinitis progression and to examine the antiviral activity of combined and alternating
      ganciclovir/foscarnet treatment and development of antiviral resistance. Sight-threatening
      CMV retinitis occurs in at least 6 percent of AIDS patients. By 1991 (US), there may be 6000
      to 10000 patients with CMV retinitis. Many clinical reports suggest that both ganciclovir
      (DHPG) and foscarnet have an antiviral effect against CMV that is often associated with
      clinical stabilization. Effectiveness of ganciclovir and foscarnet is correlated with weekly
      maintenance and since toxicity is dose-limiting in up to 20 percent of patients receiving
      either drug for long periods, it may be beneficial in long-term maintenance treatment to
      combine or alternate these two drugs at a lower total weekly dose of each drug.

      This strategy may result in a greater net antiviral effect with less toxicity than is seen
      with either drug alone, because the toxicities of each drug are quite different.

      following multiple doses of FIAC. (An example of another nucleoside analog effective against

      opportunistic disease in patients with HIV-related infection. The purine nucleoside
      ganciclovir has been used to treat AIDS patients with CMV disease. Although ganciclovir is
      useful in treating CMV disease, such treatment is frequently complicated by hematologic
      (blood) toxicity. Also, treatment is difficult because it requires daily intravenous dosing.
      Test tube studies show that FIAC and its primary breakdown product FIAU are highly and
      specifically active against several viruses including CMV. A single-dose, pharmacokinetic
      (blood level) study showed that FIAC, when taken orally, is readily absorbed into the
      bloodstream, and most of it is converted to FIAU.

        -  Lymph node biopsies (patients only) Patients will have no more than four lymph node
           biopsies, performed no more frequently than once a month. The biopsy is done by a
           surgeon and may require a 2- to 3-day hospital stay. The skin above the lymph nodes is
           numbed with a local anesthetic, an incision is made and the tissue is removed.
           Alternatively, a needle biopsy may be done, in which a small amount of lymph tissue is
           withdrawn through a special needle injected into the site.

        -  Intestinal biopsies (patients and volunteers) Volunteers will have one intestinal
           biopsy procedure. Patients may have up to six intestinal biopsy procedures, each
           separated by at least 10 days. This is done by a gastroenterologist as an outpatient
           procedure. A flexible tube (sigmoidoscope or colonoscope) with a light and special lens
           at the tip is inserted into the rectum and large bowel. Wire instruments passed through
           the tube are used to extract small tissue samples.

NCT00001890,Effects of Hormone Therapy on the Immune Systems of Postmenopausal Women With Chronic Infections,"
      Hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis) and heart disease are much more common in men
      than in women. However, as women grow older, especially after menopause the incidence of
      atherosclerosis and heart disease increases. These findings suggest that estrogen may be
      protective and help in preventing heart disease.

      Studies of large groups of post-menopausal women suggest that hormone replacement therapy
      (therapy that includes estrogen) reduces the risk of heart disease. Estrogen causes
      favorable changes in particles that carry cholesterol in the blood stream and improves
      function of blood vessels. Estrogen may also stimulate the immune system's ability to fight
      off infections that may lead to or contribute to atherosclerosis.

      Researchers believe two specific infectious agents (Chlamydia pneumoniae and human
      cytomegalovirus) may cause damage to the lining of blood vessels resulting in inflammation
      and the development of atherosclerosis.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if estrogen treatment can change how the immune
      system responds to chronic infections, by Chlamydia pneumoniae and human cytomegalovirus, in
      postmenopausal women.

NCT00034437,Immune Response to Cytomegalovirus,"
      This study will evaluate immune responses against cytomegalovirus (CMV). About 80 percent of
      adults have been exposed to this virus. CMV typically remains dormant (inactive) in the
      body, causing no problems. In people with immune suppression, however, the virus can become
      reactivated and cause life-threatening pneumonia. The knowledge gained from this study may
      be useful in developing ways to improve immune responses to CMV in stem cell transplant
      recipients.

      Healthy normal volunteers between 18 and 65 years of age who have been exposed to
      cytomegalovirus are eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical
      history and blood tests. Those enrolled will provide a 30-milliliter (6-tablespoon) blood
      sample once a week for 4 weeks and a final sample 2 months later. The blood will be used to

NCT00077909,Study of Lung Proteins in Patients With Pneumonia,"
      This study will examine the different types of proteins present in the lungs of patients
      with pneumonia to explore the causes of different types of the disease. Pneumonia is a
      condition that causes lung inflammation AND is often caused by an infection. It is usually
      diagnosed by lung x-rays and listening to the chest with a stethoscope. This method can
      diagnose pneumonia, but it does not provide information on the cause of the inflammation -
      information that might be helpful in guiding treatment. This study will measure proteins in
      the lungs of patients to see if certain proteins are associated with specific forms of
      pneumonia, and can thus serve as biomarkers for disease.

      Patients undergoing diagnostic bronchoscopy at the NIH Clinical Center may participate in
      this study. Patients will undergo bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage as scheduled for
      their medical care. For this procedure, the patient's mouth and throat are numbed with
      lidocaine; a sedative may be given for comfort. A thin flexible tube called a bronchoscope
      is advanced through the nose or mouth into the lung airways to examine the airways
      carefully. Saline (salt water) is then injected through the bronchoscope into the air
      passage, acting as a rinse. A sample of fluid is then withdrawn for microscopic examination.
      Researchers in the current study will use some of the fluid obtained from the lavage to
      examine for protein content.

      In addition to the bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage, participants will have about 2
      tablespoons of blood drawn to compare blood test results with the results of the lung
      washings. Patients' medical records will be reviewed to obtain information on past medical
      history, current medical treatment, vital signs, and results of x-ray tests.

NCT00225394,Long Term Use of Valganciclovir for Prophylaxis of CMV Disease in Kidney and Pancreas Transplant Patients,"
      CMV viral disease negatively affects transplant patients. CMV is the most prevalent
      infection in transplant patients and 3 month drug regimens to prevent the virus have been
      mostly unsuccessful, usually after the drug has been stopped, the patient develops the viral
      disease. Extended use of anti-viral drugs may, in fact, may lead to the development of
      resistant virus. We hypothesize that extended use (12 months) of valganciclovir
      (Valcyte™)will not only be efficacious but will not be associated with the development of
      resistant CMV.

      from your transplant donor's blood, called T-cells, that have been grown and immunized
      against the CMV virus in the test tube. If the transplant donor is immune to CMV (ie: the
      donor has antibody to CMV in the blood), the T-cells will be selected and grown from the
      blood of the transplant donor. However, if the transplant donor is not immune to CMV, or if
      T-cells from the donor are not readily available, CMV-immune T-cells grown from the blood of
      another normal donor who is partially matched to the patients tissue type can be used. The
      transplant physician will explain which of these treatments is available to the patient.

      This trial is called a phase I trial because phase I trials are designed to test the safety
      of different doses of an experimental treatment. We want to find out what effects, good
      and/or bad, a dose/doses of these immune T-cells will have on the patient and on the CMV

NCT00907686,TT-CMV Observational Birth Cohort Study,"
      The spread of viruses through transfusions is the cause of serious illness and death in
      recipients whose immune systems are unable to fight infection. Another group of patients
      whose immune systems are underdeveloped and can be affected by a particular virus known as
      cytomegalovirus (CMV) is low birthweight infants (LBWIs). CMV can be spread through the
      placenta, during the birth process, through breast milk, while in the hospital or while
      caring for someone carrying the virus as well as through a transfusion, known as
      transfusion-transmitted (TT-CMV).

      The spread of TT-CMV in LBWIs can be curtailed by transfusing blood products that are CMV
      negative as well as to filter the white cells in blood that carry the virus
      (leukoreduction). The purpose of this study is to see if the use of these two strategies can
      lower the spread of CMV through a transfusion. How ""safe"" the blood actually is through
      leukoreduction is not known and CMV still occurs in LBWIs. It is not clear whether this
      approach is optimal or whether additional safety steps are needed to completely prevent
      TT-CMV. Specific actions that could tell us when virus has reached the blood product or
      breast milk is to test each of these to determine if virus slipped ""unnoticed"" and/or when
      the product was not thoroughly filtered.

      In this study, the investigators believe that the use of both prevention strategies will
      result in a lower rate of TT-CMV, and that the ""cause"" of TT-CMV may be found in the
      presence of CMV at the DNA level or by unfiltered white cells that remain in the blood
      product. Thus, the most significant clinical question that remains to be addressed is
      whether this double strategy for transfusion safety actually provides a ""zero CMV-risk""
      blood supply or whether further safety measures (DNA testing + 100% leukoreduction) must be
      used to protect this extremely vulnerable patient group from CMV infection. This birth
      cohort study will be done with 6 participating NICUs, and will study both CMV positive and
      negative mothers in order to estimate the rate and pathway of CMV transmission to the LBWI
      who receives a transfusion. Another study goal is to compare or link any CMV infection by
      either transfused units where the virus was undetected, or filter failure. If CMV disease
      occurs, the investigators will be able to describe the course and outcome in LBWIs who
      develop TT-CMV.

NCT00954200,Ibuprofen as a Possible Preventer of Post Bronchoscopy Fever,"
      Scientific background: Bronchoscopy is a procedure commonly performed in the management of
      persistent respiratory illness. In the last decades this exam has become a routine and safe
      procedure even in children and there are few side-effects. However, one known side effect is
      transient fever and even high fever a few hours after the bronchoscopy. This side effect is
      not dangerous but very uncomfortable for the patients and it would be interesting to try to
      reduce this phenomena. This fever is due to a release of cytokines during the
      broncho-alveolar lavage procedure and not to sepsis. In a previous study a single dose of
      dexamethasone was shown to prevent the fever post bronchoscopy with no apparent detriment to
      the child. It is well known that steroids are immunosuppressive. Even though the
      post-bronchoscopy fever is not caused by an infection, it seems preferable to use other
      anti-inflammatory drugs to fight this very inconvenient side effect.

      Ibuprofen (Nurofen*) is known as an effective medication to reduce fever in infectious
      illnesses and is even considered as superior to paracetamol. It has no immunosuppressive
      effect and is usually well tolerated by children with very few side effects when taken in
      the normal therapeutic dose of 10mg/Kg. The investigators postulate that a dose of Nurofen
      prior to bronchoscopy could significantly reduce fever post bronchoscopy.

NCT01128907,Galactomannan Antigen in Bronchoalveolar Lavage in the Diagnosis of Invasive Aspergillosis in Neutropenic Patients,"
      Invasive Aspergillosis (IA) is a very serious fungal infection. Hematological patients are
      the most affected group. IA has a very high morbimortality due to its rapid progression and
      because it is very difficult to be early diagnosed. Diagnosis is used to be done too late or
      even post-mortem. They are two new methods (techniques) trying to make the diagnosis on an
      early stage: detection of Galactomannan antigen of Aspergillus species and real - time
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of its DNA in blood. IA in immunocompromised patients is
      mainly located in lungs, so our hypothesis is that in patients where the investigators
      suspect IA the investigators should find earlier Galactomannan antigen or real -time PCR of
      Aspergillus in respiratory samples such as bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and its detection
      could be useful for diagnosis.

      Objectives: To detect Galactomannan Antigen and Real Time - PCR for Aspergillus DNA in
      bronchoalveolar lavage. To validate the routine utility of these tests in BAL as a
      diagnostic method of IA and investigate if Galactomannan Antigen and Real Time - PCR for
      Aspergillus DNA in bronchoalveolar lavage can optimize blood test sensibility.

      Methods: Prospective study. The investigators will include 200 patients. 100 of them will be
      hematological patients, neutropenic and at high risk to develop an IA. The other 100 will be
      patients without risk or no suspicion at all of IA. The investigators will perform a BAL in
      all patients. And blood detection of Galactomannan Antigen in hematological patients. The
      investigators will perform a standard microbiological culture of BAL and Galactomannan
      Antigen in both samples (bronchoalveolar lavage and blood). The investigators also will

NCT01376778,A Randomized Trial to Prevent Congenital Cytomegalovirus (CMV),"
      Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common virus that usually presents with few if any side effects.
      When first infected, some people may have symptoms similar to mononucleosis (i.e., fatigue,
      weakness, fever, swollen glands). Most people in the United States are infected during
      childhood or as adults if they work around children. Pregnant women, who have not been
      infected with CMV in the past and become infected during pregnancy (i.e. a primary
      infection), may cause their babies to get infected with CMV. Babies that are infected may
      develop permanent disabilities including hearing loss and a small portion will die from the
      infection.

      Currently it is not routine practice to screen pregnant women for CMV infection.
      Additionally, there is no agreement about how to evaluate and manage pregnant women infected
      with CMV for the first time. There is also no evidence that treatment is beneficial for the
      baby.

      The purpose of this research study is to determine whether treating pregnant women who have
      a primary CMV infection with CMV antibodies will reduce the number of babies infected with
      CMV.

      Subjects have a type of blood cell cancer, other blood disease or a genetic disease for
      which they received a stem cell transplant. After transplant while the immune system grows
      back the subjects have an infection with one or more of three viruses - Epstein Barr virus
      (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV) or adenovirus - that has persisted or come back despite
      standard therapy.

      Adenovirus is a virus that causes symptoms of a common cold normally but can cause serious
      life-threatening infections in patients who have weak immune systems. It usually affects the
      lungs and can cause a very serious pneumonia, but it can also affect the gut, the liver, the
      pancreas and the eyes.

      CMV is a virus that can also cause serious infections in patients with suppressed immune
      systems. It usually affects the lungs and can cause a very serious pneumonia, but it can
      also affect the intestinal tract, the liver and the eyes. Approximately 2/3 of normal people
      harbor this virus in their body. In healthy people CMV rarely causes any problems because
      the immune system can keep it under control. If the subject and/or the subject's donor are
      positive for CMV, s/he is at risk of developing CMV disease while his/her immune system is
      weak post transplant.

      EBV is the virus that causes glandular fever or kissing disease. It is also normally
      controlled by a healthy immune system, but when the immune system is weak, it can cause
      fevers, enlarged lymph nodes and sometimes develop into a type of cancer called lymphoma.

      This treatment with specially trained T cells (called CTLs) has had activity against these
      viruses when the cells are made from the transplant donor. However, as it takes 2-3 months
      to make the cells, that approach is not practical when the subject already has an infection.
      We want to find out if we can use CTLs which have already been made from another donor that
      match the subject and his/her donor as closely as possible and if the CTLs will last in the
      body and have activity against these viruses.

      In a recent study these cells were given to 50 patients with viral infections post
      transplant and over 70% had a complete or partial response. The purpose of this study is to
      make CTL lines leftover from that previous study available to patients with viral infections
      that have not responded to standard treatments.

      These virus-specific CTLs are an investigational product not approved by the FDA.

      Background: The presence of low-grade viral infection in the airways of patients with stable
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) could potentially have implications in the
      pathogenesis and progression of the disease, but previous studies have reported very
      different rates of human rhinovirus (HRV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) genome
      detection in nasal and sputum samples. However, no study has investigated the presence of
      these viruses directly in the lungs by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and bronchial biopsies.
      This study aimed to investigate whether HRV and RSV are present in the lungs of stable COPD
      patients by performing BAL and bronchial biopsies, and relate their presence with disease
      severity.

      diagnostic (e.g., lung cancer) and/or therapeutic (e.g., hemoptysis) fibreoptic bronchoscopy
      in a university hospital in Athens, Greece, were enrolled. The collected BAL and bronchial

NCT02630537,Validation of Lophius Kits T-Track® CMV and T-Track® EBV in Hemodialysis Patients,"
      Cell-mediated immunity (CMI) and in particular T cells play a critical role in the rejection
      of transplanted organs. Thus, in transplant recipients a life-long and individualized
      immunosuppressive medication is required to avoid graft rejection. However, a too weak
      suppression of CMI causes acute and chronic graft damage leading to transplant loss, whereas
      a too potent suppression of CMI supports opportunistic infections and reactivation of
      persistent viruses.

      One of the biggest challenges in the field of transplantation is to provide a personalized
      immunosuppressive and antiviral therapy based on reliable assessment and monitoring of CMI.
      This could lead to a reduction of graft rejections and virus reactivations in transplant
      recipients.

      With the development of both assays T-Track® CMV and T-Track® EBV, Lophius Biosciences GmbH
      has implemented its novel proprietary T-activation technology for an improved assessment of
      the functionality of CMI in cytomegalovirus (CMV)- and/or Epstein-Barr virus
      (EBV)-seropositive individuals. In contrast to other existing systems the Lophius assays
      open up the opportunity to characterize the functionality of CMI as an entire network.

      The planned clinical multicenter study aims to verify the suitability of the two assays for
      a reliable assessment of the functionality of CMI.

      Hemodialysis patients have been identified as an appropriate patient cohort for
      investigating the clinical sensitivity of the Lophius assays as these patients closely
      resemble kidney transplant recipients prior to an immunosuppressive therapy.

      The determination of the functional CMI in the course of an immunosuppressive treatment may
      in future enable physicians to optimize the individual immunosuppressive and antiviral
      therapy in transplant recipients to reduce the risk of rejection as well as virus
      reactivations and associated diseases.

      who live at home with family caregivers. The innovative intervention, the Tailored Activity
      Program (TAP-VA), involves 8 sessions over 4 months in Veterans' homes. An occupational
      therapist conducts a systematic assessment to identify a Veteran's preserved capabilities
      and deficit areas, and previous roles, habits and interests from which to develop and
      introduce activities tailored to the Veteran's profile. Family caregivers are then trained
      to incorporate tailored activities into daily care routines. The intervention was pilot

      Palliative care for end-stage organ failure patients has been included as one of the key
      programs to be implemented in 2011-2012 in the Hospital Authority, Hong Kong. Among all the
      disease groups, end-stage heart failure patients have the highest mortality rate. Patients
      at the end stage of heart failure have health concerns shared by other end-stage patients
      including cancer patients. Many guidelines, local and world-wide, have advocated a
      palliative approach of care for those heart failure patients who are at end stage. Studies
      have shown that end-stage heart failure patients tend to have frequent emergency room visits
      and repeated hospital admissions. Also, these patients suffer from a number of health
      problems that adversely affect their Quality Of Life.

      There is scarcity of experimental studies informing practitioners which models work best for
      palliative patients in Hong Kong. There were randomized controlled trials conducted outside
      Hong Kong which suggest multidisciplinary approach of palliative care is possible to reduce
      readmissions but evidence is not present for other outcomes such as symptom control and

NCT02271750,IGF and Other Neurotrophic Factors in Patients With Dementia,"
      The global prevalence of dementia is close to 36 million (2010). Furthermore the number is
      predicted to double in the next 20 years, primarily due to the demographic ageing. A
      perspective that will challenge the current healthcare systems and national economies.

      Dementia is characterized by progressive deterioration in cognition, function and behavior
      that is sufficiently severe to compromise social and occupational functioning.

      The pathogenesis of dementia remains elusive. Thus, there is a need to increase our
      understanding of the mechanisms leading to the most common forms of dementia. A better
      understanding of the disease may enable an earlier diagnosis and importantly, a causal
      treatment of Alzheimer as opposed to the merely symptomatic options available to day.

      An experiment with rats and memory might already have taken the first step towards this. The
      experiment has demonstrated that administration of IGF-II to rats significantly enhances
      memory retention and prevents forgetting. Furthermore inhibitory avoidance learning leads to
      an increase in the hippocampal expression of IGF-II. Finally, yet importantly, injections of
      recombinant IGF-II into hippocampus after training or memory retrieval significantly enhance
      memory retention and prevent forgetting.

      The spinal fluid and the serum will be analysed at the Medical Research Laboratory. The
      immunological concentrations of IGF-I and -II are measured by validated in-house analyses.
      Furthermore, Aarhus University Hospital has a unique technique, whereby it is possible to
      measure the bioactivity of IGF-I and -II in the cerebrospinal fluid. The concentrations of
      NGF, BDNF and sCD-163 in spinal fluid and serum will be analysed by already established
      techniques.

      The purpose of this study is therefore to define the concentration and biological activity
      of IGF-I, IGF-II, BDNF, NGF and sCD-163 in the cerebrospinal fluid and serum in patients
      with Alzheimer's compared with controls.

      Freezing of gait (FOG) is among the most disabling motor features of Parkinson disease (PD)
      and is present in other forms of parkinsonism as well. FOG is a brief (usually lasting <30
      seconds) episode of absence or a greatly reduced forward movement of the feet despite
      intention to walk. It typically occurs when patients initiate gait (so-called ""start
      hesitation"") and when attempting to turn. It is a leading cause of falls and often results
      in a wheelchair-dependent state. FOG greatly interferes with activities of daily living,
      causes social isolation and poor quality of life.

      FOG is one of the least understood features of PD. It possibly may develop independent of
      the other motor features of the disease, and be caused by specific pathological changes in
      the brain. Previous studies on FOG have shown conflicting information and have not lead to
      clear understanding of the pathophysiology. One key reason for this is that there appears to
      be multiple subtypes which have rarely been taken into account.

      The purpose of this study is to show that different types of FOG exist and to see if there
      is a connection to cognitive differences or gait patterns.

      on a battery of cognitive, affective, and behavioural measures. They will be compared to a

      9-year period occurred in individuals over the age of 74 years. Although many infectious
      diseases are more problematic in the elderly because of a decline in immune function and a

      The most common soil transmitted helminthic infections(STHI) includes infection with Ascaris
      lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura, and Hookworm. Growth retardation, malnutrition, anemia,
      impaired cognitive function and immunosuppression are main manifestations in children. Even
      within the developing world, wide differences exist in prevalence rates. The poorest
      countries have higher levels of STHI than those with a lower incidence of poverty. According
      to an estimate made by the WHO, the prevalence of A. lumbricoides, T. trichiura and Hookworm
      in South Asia was 27%, 20% and 16% respectively. Given that the prevalence of STHI in urban
      slums in Bangladesh is much higher than the other parts of the world and Asia and that there
      are major health and socio-economic consequences of such infections, it is important that we
      come up with effective means of reducing the prevalence of such infections. 60-80% of
      preschool children in urban slums of Bangladesh are infected with these STHI due to poor
      hygiene . At present deworming at six months interval is recommended but the effectiveness
      of this regimen of dewormig is questionable.

      2. Hypothesis: Ante-helminthic treatment at every three month is more effective than
      ante-helminthic treatment at every six months to reduce soil transmitted helminthic
      infection, to reduce diarrheal and respiratory illness to improve nutritional status in
      preschool children.

      3.Objective: The main objectives of the proposed study is to compare the relative efficacy
      of two different ante-helminthic treatment regimens to reduce the prevalence of STHI,
      diarrheal diseases, respiratory illness and to improve nutritional status in children 4.
      Design: The population of the study will be preschool children aged 2-5 year and will be
      selected randomly from an urban of Dhaka. They will be divided into two groups randomly. One
      group will get ante-helminthic at every three months interval and the other groups will get
      at six months interval for one year. Stool samples will be collected at the baseline and
      after three months completing one-year treatment of the above mentioned regimen. Blood
      haemoglobulin and nutritional status will also be measured at baseline and after three
      months of completion of treatment as mentioned above. The treatment will be 400 mg of
      Albendazole in a single dose.

      Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common, complex clinical syndrome characterized by alterations
      in the normal vaginal flora. Bacterial vaginosis has been associated with a variety of
      adverse health outcomes including endometritis; post-abortion endometritis; nongonococcal,
      nonchlamydial pelvic inflammatory disease; and an increased risk of acquiring and
      transmitting HIV infection. In pregnancy, BV is associated with premature rupture of the
      membranes, chorioamnionitis, amniotic fluid infection, preterm labor, preterm birth, and
      postpartum endometritis. Several studies have documented increased postpartum complications
      in the newborn and infants. The etiology of BV is poorly understood but recurrence is quite
      common despite treatment. Documented recurrence rate of up to 30% within three months are
      reported. Small studies have shown that adding vaginal acidifying gel to standard antibiotic
      regimens may reduce recurrence rates of BV. We plan an RCT comparing standard antibiotic
      therapy to antibiotics plus vaginal acidifying gel. Our hypothesis is that the addition of
      an acidifying gel will decrease the chance of recurrence of BV within 3 months.

      Conduct of the study

        -  The study consists of four testing days in the University Hospitals Leuven,
           Gasthuisberg campus.

        -  On each test day you come at the agreed time in fasting State to the Gastroenterology
           Department at UZ Leuven (Gasthuisberg, floor 0, Orange arrow). Fasted state means that
           you have eaten nothing for 12 hours for the investigation and only have been drinking
           water.

        -  A basic clinical anamnesis will be taken by a doctor to make sure that you are a
           healthy volunteer for our study. For making sure that you are HIV negative, you will
           undergo an HIV test. In case of a female volunteer, a pregnancy test will be taken in
           account to make sure you are not pregnant.

        -  Upon arrival at the hospital through the nose or the mouth two probes: one in the
           stomach and one in the gut. The position of both probes is controlled using fluoroscopy
           (x-ray).

        -  After a stabilisation period of ca. 20 min you will be asked for taking a single dose
           of Gabbroral® oral tablet formulation. On four different test days, with an
           intermediate period of at least 7 days, we will follow every one of following intake
           conditions:

             1. intake of Gabbroral® oral tablet formulation, which will be dissolved in a glas of
                240mL water, in fasted state.

             2. intake of Gabbroral® oral tablet formulation in fed state.

             3. Intake of 2 tablets of Motilium® (API: domperidone 10 mg) 20 minutes before the
                intake of Gabbroral® oral tablet formulation, which will be dissolved in a glas of
                240mL water.

             4. Intake of 2 tablets of Motilium® (API: loperamide HCl 2 mg) 20 minutes before the
                intake of Gabbroral® oral tablet formulation, which will be dissolved in a glas of
                240mL water.

        -  After intake of the medicine at regular intervals, gastrointestinal fluids will be
           aspirated over 4 hours. You sit in a comfortable position in bed; eating and sleeping
           is not permitted (after 2 hours you have the possibility to drink some water).

        -  After 4 hours, the gastrointestinal catheters will be removed and you may eat and roam
           freely.

      healthy adults, ages 18-39, and 48 healthy children, ages 5-9, will participate in this
      study. Once the vaccine is proven safe and tolerable in adults, then it will be tested in
      the children. This study will require volunteers to stay in the research facility for
      several nights for the first dose; they will not be required to stay overnight for the
      second and third doses. Participants will be assigned to receive 1 of 3 vaccine dose levels
      by mouth. Study procedures include: stool samples, blood samples and documenting side
      effects. Participants will be involved in study related procedures for about 8 months.

NCT01837862,A Phase I Study of Mebendazole for the Treatment of Pediatric Gliomas,"
      This is a study to determine the safety and efficacy of the drug, mebendazole, when used in
      combination with standard chemotherapy drugs for the treatment of pediatric brain tumors.
      Mebendazole is a drug used to treat infections with intestinal parasites and has a long
      track record of safety in humans. Recently, it was discovered that mebendazole may be
      effective in treating cancer as well, in particular brain tumors. Studies using both cell
      cultures and mouse models demonstrated that mebendazole was effective in decreasing the
      growth of brain tumor cells.

      This study focuses on the treatment of a category of brain tumors called gliomas. Low-grade
      gliomas are tumors arising from the glial cells of the central nervous system and are
      characterized by slower, less aggressive growth than that of high-grade gliomas. Some
      low-grade gliomas have a more aggressive biology and an increased likelihood of resistance
      or recurrence.

      Low-grade gliomas are often able to be treated by observation alone if they receive a total
      surgical resection. However, tumors which are only partially resected and continue to grow
      or cause symptoms, or those which recur following total resection require additional
      treatment, such as chemotherapy. Due to their more aggressive nature, pilomyxoid
      astrocytomas, even when totally resected, will often be treated with chemotherapy. The
      current first-line treatment at our institution for these low-grade gliomas involves a
      three-drug chemotherapy regimen of vincristine, carboplatin, and temozolomide. However,
      based on our data from our own historical controls, over 50% of patients with pilomyxoid
      astrocytomas will continue to have disease progression while on this treatment. We believe
      that mebendazole in combination with vincristine, carboplatin, and temozolomide may provide
      an additional therapeutic benefit with increased progression-free and overall survival for
      low-grade glioma patients, particularly for those with pilomyxoid astrocytomas.

      High grade gliomas are more aggressive tumors with poor prognoses. The standard therapy is
      radiation therapy. A variety of adjuvant chemotherapeutic combinations have been used, but
      with disappointing results. For high-grade gliomas this study will add mebendazole to the
      established combination of bevacizumab and irinotecan to determine this combinations safety
      and efficacy

NCT01840891,Secondary Lactose Intolerance Due to Chronic Norovirus Infection,"
      The objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of secondary lactose intolerance
      in renal transplant recipients (RTR) with chronic norovirus infection.

      In the investigators cohort of 1000 renal transplant recipients (RTRs) in the University
      Hospital of Zurich, the investigators are currently aware of 10 patients with chronic
      norovirus infection, which was proven by positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis
      of recent stool samples, whereas chronic virus shedding is defined as more than two PCR
      positive samples in an interval of at least one month. Concomitant viral (other than
      norovirus), bacterial or parasitic (particularly Gardia lamblia) intestinal infections are
      excluded by negative stool cultures and PCR analyses, respectively. Main exclusion criterion
      for the present case series is a concomitant intestinal infection (other than norovirus) and
      primary lactose intolerance, which is previously excluded by absence of the CC genotype of
      the DNA variant -13910 T/C upstream in the LCT gene. After obtaining written and oral
      informed consent, the investigators perform a lactose hydrogen breath (LH2BT) test and a
      lactose tolerance test (LTT) in all eligible RTRs with proven chronic norovirus infection
      irrespective of current abdominal symptoms.

      The study population (N=10) is divided into two groups according to the gastrointestinal
      symptoms (asymptomatic versus symptomatic, such as chronic diarrhoea or diffuse abdominal
      discomfort). The investigators chose the cut-off three or more stools per day as indicative
      of diarrhoea for the purpose of this study. RTRs with otherwise unexplainable chronic
      diarrhoea but absent norovirus infection serve as control group (N=10).

NCT01959048,Efficacy and Safety of Fecal Microbiota Transplantation for Severe Clostridium Difficile Associated Colitis,"
      Clostridium difficile has become one of the leading causes of hospital acquired infections,
      and is associated with increased mortality. Patients with C. difficile associated disease
      (CDAD) possess deficiencies in 'normal' fecal microbial composition, most likely as a result
      of earlier antibiotic usage. The current standard of care treatment for severe C. difficile,
      which consists of antibiotics, does not restore the microbiota. Restoration of the normal
      colonic microbiota by fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) may enable reversion colonic
      microbial population to a more 'normal'state and lead to cure.

      A few patients develop severe CDAD which may be complicated by adynamic ileus, or toxic
      megacolon. The management in this context is based on limited data, and for some the only
      available option is sub-total colectomy.

      Although FMT is by no means a new therapeutic modality, there is limited information on its
      use for the treatment of acute CDAD, including severe CDAD. Because of the high morbidity
      and mortality associated with treatment of patients with severe CDAD, and because the
      evidence supporting the current recommendations is weak and based upon the demonstration
      that FMT is an effective strategy to re-establish a balanced intestinal microbiota with
      resultant cure of recurrent CDAD, we propose to study the efficacy and safety of FMT for
      severe CDAD.

      Patients with severe CDAD can be divided into two operational groups; those that have
      diarrhea and those that suffer from adynamic ileus. We propose to apply FMT through
      colonoscopy for all patients because current data suggest that the overall success rate of
      FMT for recurrent CDAD with lower gastrointestinal tract FMT was higher than FMT through the
      upper gastrointestinal tract. In addition, for patients with adynamic ileus and toxic
      megacolon (i.e., the population with the highest CDAD-associated morbidity and mortality),
      intra-colonic FMT administration is the preferred alternative.

NCT01973465,Fecal Microbiota Therapy for Recurrent Clostridium Difficile Colitis,"
      This study was developed in response to the July, 2013 FDA draft guidance regarding FMT for
      CDI. The weight of the evidence in the literature suggests that FMT is the most effective
      treatment for ambulatory outpatients affected by recurrent CDI who fail conventional
      therapy.

      The anticipated benefits to research patients enrolled in this study include resolution of
      chronic diarrhea, return of bowel habits and nutritional status to normal, and resolution of
      chronic recurrent CDI.

      FMT involves the endoscopic instillation of freshly obtained stool with millions of live
      bacteria into the recipient's colon by endoscopic lavage. With any endoscopic procedure,
      there is a risk of perforated viscous. This is very rare, but the risk is increased with
      severe CDI. The risk of acquisition of communicable enteric or blood borne pathogen appears
      to be negligible.

      females and males over 5 years of age who live in filariasis and onchocerciasis endemic
      areas. Subject selection will not be based on health status.

      Two sites will be studied, and each study will last for 4 years. Participants will be

NCT02105714,Diagnosis of Neglected Tropical Diseases Among Patients With Persistent Digestive Disorders,"
      NIDIAG is an international collaboration on integrated diagnosis-treatment platforms, funded
      by the European Commission (EC). NIDIAG aims to develop an improved, patient-centred system
      for delivering primary health care in resource-constrained settings. NIDIAG will investigate
      three clinical syndromes, namely (i) persistent digestive disorders, (ii) persistent fever
      and (iii) neurological disorders, due to neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). The current
      study focuses on persistent digestive disorders, which are defined as diarrhoea or abdominal
      pain that last for at least 2 weeks.

      While acute diarrhoea has been studied globally, few research activities have focused on the
      epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment of long-lasting diarrhoeal episodes (2 weeks and
      longer) in the tropics. The spectrum of possibly involved pathogens includes more than 30
      bacterial, parasitic and viral infectious agents. This lack of data may be explained by the
      fact that people suffering from NTDs might only seek care at a late stage of the disease.
      Furthermore, health systems in affected regions are often weak and their primary health-care
      centres are often under-staffed and lack essential diagnostic equipment.

      The hypothesis of this study is that development of an evidence-based syndromic approach can
      lead to better diagnosis and management of NTDs in patients with persistent digestive
      disorders. The study will be carried out in two West African countries (Côte d'Ivoire and
      Mali) and in two Asian countries (Indonesia and Nepal). The study will follow a
      ""case-control"" design and patients and controls will be prospectively enrolled. In order to
      address the knowledge gaps, three specific objectives will be pursued. First, the
      contribution of NTDs to the 'persistent digestive disorders syndrome' will be assessed.
      Second, the value of clinical features and rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for the diagnosis
      of target NTDs that give rise to persistent digestive disorders will be determined. Third,
      the clinical response to standard empiric and targeted treatment of several NTDs in patients
      with persistent digestive disorders will be evaluated. These objectives will provide a
      long-term benefit for the communities by improving the clinical decision-making process for
      the target NTDs and thus, better diagnostic work-up and patient management can be achieved
      in the study countries and other similar resource-constrained countries

NCT02551289,MAgnetic Resonance Imaging in COeliac Disease,"
      One in 100 people suffers from coeliac disease. It affects the lining of the bowel and
      causes many symptoms such as diarrhoea, wind, stomach pain, constipation and nausea. The
      only treatment so far is a strict glutenfree diet for life which reverses the bowel damage
      and often improves symptoms. Up to 25% of patients however may have persistent symptoms
      despite the gluten free diet but the reasons for this are not clear.

      This research aims to help us understand how the gluten free diet works. Investigators will
      use medical imaging (magnetic resonance imaging or MRI) to measure the volumes of fluid in
      the small bowel, the size of the large bowel and the time it takes for foods to go through
      the entire bowel in patients who have just been diagnosed with coeliac disease by their
      hospital doctor. Investigators will also carry out a breath test and collect a stool sample
      for basic analysis of the stool bacteria.

      Investigators will also collect questionnaires about their feelings and their bowel habits
      and will try to see how the MRI measurements relate to the patients' symptoms. Investigators
      will observe how all these measures change after one year of the gluten free diet that
      doctors will have prescribed as part of the coeliac patients' standard care. As such there
      is no dietary intervention in this study, investigators will simply study changes in the
      patients due to their standard treatment. Investigators will also look at a matched group of
      healthy volunteers to gather a likely reference range of the measurements. This research
      will be carried out in Nottingham with the help of the specialist coeliac clinics and it
      will last 3 years. There is a dedicated Coeliac Patient Public Involvement group who have

      defecation, characterized either as diarrhea predominant or constipation predominant. About
      one third of pediatric IBS subjects have d-IBS. There are no FDA approved treatments for
      children with d-IBS. There is evidence that diarrhea predominant irritable bowel syndrome
      d-IBS may be caused by a mild inflammation in the intestinal lining. Oral serum-derived
      bovine immunoglobulin protein isolate (SBI) is a medical food, believed to treat mild
      inflammation in the small intestine associated with some cases of d-IBS, especially those
      arising after acute gastroenteritis. It improved pain and diarrhea in adults with d-IBS. Our

NCT01856205,Safety and Efficacy Study of Intravenous Immunoglobulin to Treat Japanese Encephalitis,"
      Japanese encephalitis is caused by a viral infection of the brain transmitted by the bite of
      an infected mosquito. Patients with Japanese encephalitis can rapidly develop worsening
      conscious level and seizures. Around a third will die from the infection and half of
      survivors have serious long-term neurological disability. The majority of those affected are
      children. There are many causes of viral encephalitis, however Japanese encephalitis virus
      is the most common cause worldwide with over 60,000 cases annually. It occurs over much of
      Asia and the geographical range is expanding. There is no specific treatment for Japanese
      encephalitis virus, although several have been trialed. In this study we examined the effect
      of a new treatment, called intravenous immunoglobulin, on children with Japanese
      encephalitis in Nepal. Prior studies have suggested intravenous immunoglobulin may
      neutralize Japanese encephalitis virus and suppress damaging inflammation in the brain. It
      has previously been used in individual cases but never examined in a randomized trial. There
      was recently a trial of IVIG in West Nile encephalitis in the United States, in which
      Professor Solomon was on the Scientific Advisory Committee. In this study we will look if
      intravenous immunoglobulin is safe in this context, and that this treatment may alter the
      way the immune system manages the infection. Therefore, in this pilot study we will test the
      hypothesis that IVIG can be safely given to children with suspected JE, with no increased
      risk of serious adverse events compared with placebo. The aim of this proposal is to conduct
      a pilot safety and tolerability randomized placebo controlled trial of intravenous
      immunoglobulin (IVIG) in patients with Japanese encephalitis, to explore the relationship
      between JEV viral load, pro-inflammatory markers called cytokines and blood brain barrier

NCT02114190,Family-Based Mindful Eating Intervention for Overweight Adolescents,"
      With currently 35% of U.S. adolescents being overweight and one in six having metabolic
      syndrome, adolescent obesity is one of the major global health challenges of the 21st
      century. Few enduring treatment strategies have been identified in adolescent populations
      and the majority of standard weight loss programs fail to adequately address the impact of
      psychological factors on eating behavior and the beneficial contribution of parental
      involvement in adolescent behavior change. A critical need exists to expand treatment
      development efforts beyond traditional education and cognitive-behavioral programs and to
      explore alternative treatment models for adolescent obesity. Meditation-based mindful eating
      programs may represent a unique and novel scientific approach to the current adolescent
      obesity epidemic as they address key psychological variables affecting weight. Furthermore,
      the recent expansion of mindfulness programs to include family relationships shows the
      immense potential for broadening the customarily individual focus of this intervention to
      include broader factors thought to influence adolescent health outcomes. Thus, we propose to
      develop a mindful eating approach to eating behavior and weight loss specifically tailored
      for adolescents and their families. The first phase of our three phase development process
      will be devoted to adapting an adolescent protocol (Mindful Eating-A) based on an
      established mindful eating program currently being used with adult populations. We will then
      develop a 'family enhanced Mindful Eating-A' (Mindful Eating-A+F) protocol that integrates a
      family systems perspective. The goal of Mindful Eating-A+F is to expand the focus of Mindful
      Eating-A to include family factors that influence adolescent eating behaviors. The second
      design phase will consist of an initial test of both intervention components to provide
      feedback on usefulness and acceptability (N = 10 families). The final phase will examine the
      overall efficacy of the optimized Mindful Eating-A+F, relative to the Mindful Eating-A
      intervention with 30 overweight adolescents (BMI > 85th percentile) ages 14-17 and at least

NCT02510638,The Clinical Epidemiology of Hospitalized Dengue Cases in Malaysia,"
      Dengue infection has been identified as the fastest spreading mosquito-borne viral disease
      by World Health Organization (WHO), which affects more than 2.5 billion people living in the
      subtropical and tropical regions. Malaysia is hyper-endemic with all four dengue virus
      serotypes circulating and responsible for the escalating number of cases over the years. As
      of 28 February 2015, there are 62 deaths secondary to dengue infection being reported in
      Malaysia; and the total number of dengue cases reported in the same period was 23,966 which
      is 46% higher than the same reporting period of 2014. Although dengue virus has been
      identified for so many years and plenty of research work has been carried out, it was proven
      that there are still many aspects that we are not too sure about the disease. Therefore,
      this multi-center, observational cohort study is designed to investigate the clinical course
      of hospitalized dengue infection in Malaysia. The study population of this study consists of
      male or female patients with dengue to be randomly sampled from hospitals in Malaysia. This
      study will be conducted in 2 stages whereby the 1st stage will only focus on the basic
      social and clinical data to describe the clinical course of dengue as general and the 2nd
      stage will collect the more detailed clinical and management data to describe the detailed
      clinical course, management and prognosis of dengue. All hospital participation in this

      infections, associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality and is highly significant
      economically since all respiratory infections, and pneumonia especially, cause about 80% of
      antimicrobials use in the community. The high frequency of respiratory infections and the
      excessive use of antimicrobials are major contributors to the development of pathogens
      resistant to antimicrobials. In addition, in CAP almost all patients are treated

      treated by different antibiotics. The investigators hypothesize that antibiotic therapy can
      be targeted and improved by doing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of nose swabs to
      identify probable implicated organisms and their antibiotic resistance patterns. This pilot

NCT00873522,Microbiology and Clinical Outcome of Pneumonia,"
      1. BACKGROUND

           Pneumonia occurring outside of the hospital setting is regarded as community acquired
           pneumonia. However, pneumonia occurring in non-hospital long-term care facilities
           constituted a distinct type of pneumonia from CAP. Kollef et al has justified health
           care associated pneumonia (HCAP) as a new category of pneumonia [1]. The HCAP patients
           are associated with severe disease, higher mortality rate, and greater length of stay
           and increased cost [1]. HCAP are often at risk for multi-drug resistant bacterial
           pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase Klebsiella
           pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) [2].

           Health care facilities have not been defined in Taiwan. Respiratory care ward (RCW) is
           a special unit to take care long-term ventilatory dependent patients in Taiwan. Some of
           the patients get pneumonia and are referred back to medical centers. Besides,
           community-acquired P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii or MRSA have been reported
           [3-8]. Therefore, the core-organisms of HCAP in Taiwan might be multi-drug resistant
           and the causes of inadequate initial antibiotics treatment. The common pathogens were
           also unknown.

           Till now, there are no data about the pathogens of HCAP in Taiwan. We define the
           health-care facilities and initiate a retrospective study to characterize the
           microbiology and clinical outcome of Community acquired pneumonia and
           Health-Care-Associated pneumonia in Taiwan. Further analysis will perform to confirm
           the differences between CAP an HCAP in Taiwan.

NCT00977366,Neurophysiology of Cough Reflex Hypersensitivity,"
      Central sensitisation is an increase in the excitability of nerves within the central
      nervous system, which can lead to heightened sensitivity to certain stimuli. This process is
      involved in some chronic pain conditions e.g. migraines and non−cardiac chest pain. Recent
      work by our group suggests central sensitisation may be an important mechanism leading to
      chronic cough.

      The main questions in this study include:

        1. Can the investigators induce temporary central sensitisation of the cough reflex in
           healthy volunteers for testing of new medications?

        2. Can the investigators demonstrate exaggerated sensitisation in patients with chronic
           cough (indicating these patients are already centrally sensitised)?

      In animal studies, acid infusion into the gullet (oesophagus) is able to induce central
      sensitisation of the cough reflex. Acid infusion into the oesophagus has also been shown to
      induce central sensitisation in human healthy volunteers, increasing the sensitivity to pain
      on the front of the chest but this study did not test the the cough reflex. Using human
      participants, the investigators plan to test whether acid infusion into the oesophagus
      increases the sensitivity of the cough reflex in healthy volunteers and also patients
      complaining of chronic cough.

NCT01071421,Sleep Apnea Syndrome and Community Acquired Pneumonia,"
      The association of sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (SAHS) with the infections of the lower

      colonization by microorganisms is considered a main event in most of the cases of community
      acquired pneumonia (CAP) , and specially in the nosocomial pneumonia. The silent aspiration
      to the lower airway is a common phenomenon in normal subjects during the sleep and some
      studies has reported that the patients with SAHS present an increase of the risk to
      pharyngeal aspirations. In fact, the presence of nasal and bronchial inflammation in
      patients with SAHS is a recognized event. The patients with SAHS could have a risk increased
      to develop pneumonia due to predisposition to the pharyngeal microaspiration to lower
      airways during the sleep and other mechanical factors associated. The prevalence of SAHS in
      patients with CAP could be increased as regards the data published for the same Spanish
      population. The presence of an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) could be a risk factor not only to
      to CAP but to to present a unfavorable clinical evolution in comparison to patients with CAP
      with a normal AHI. The aim of this study will establish a relation between SAHS and the

      This study seeks to assess whether coma patients really benefit from the use of antibiotics

      Our hypothesis is that neurological patients in coma state, requiring mechanical

      Two-arm cluster randomized controlled trial located in Hala district, Pakistan to determine
      the impact of using Lady Health Workers (LHW) of National Program for Family Planning and
      Primary Health Care to diagnose and manage severe pneumonia with oral amoxicillin on
      treatment failure rates at day 6 among 2-59 month old children. LHWs in the control arm
      receive a refresher in standard pneumonia case management. LHWs in the intervention arm
      receive standard training that is enhanced to include training in the recognition of severe
      pneumonia and its home management with oral amoxicillin. Clusters are by Union Council (UC),
      administrator units consisting of 7 to 25 LHWs; each UC is randomized to either enhanced
      pneumonia case management with oral amoxicillin therapy (intervention) for severe pneumonia
      or standard case management and referral to the nearest health facility for treatment
      (control). Process indicators reflecting the LHW's ability to assess, classify and treat
      pneumonia in the intervention group and cost-effectiveness data is also being collected.

      Primary Hypothesis:

      Enhanced pneumonia case management and oral amoxicillin therapy for severe pneumonia
      delivered by LHWs in the community will result in a reduction in treatment failure among
      children 2 - 59 months of age with severe pneumonia who are treated by the LHW compared with
      those referred for care by the LHW.

      Secondary Hypotheses:

        1. The proportion of treatment failure, [persistence of lower chest indrawing (LCI) or

      using clinical stability criteria as a reference to establish the duration of antibiotic

NCT01800942,Prevention of Bacterial Infections in Newborn,"
      The last decade has witnessed an important reduction of the mortality in children under 5
      years but such reduction has not impacted in neonates. Mortality in neonates contributes 40%
      of all deaths occurring in children below 5 years of age.

      Severe bacterial disease is among the leading causes of neonatal deaths. Bacterial disease
      follows bacterial infection. Individuals can be infected without developing disease
      (carriage stage) but infection is needed to subsequently develop disease. In sub-Saharan
      Africa, bacterial carriage (i.e. in the birth canal and/or nasopharyngeal tract) is very
      common in all age groups, with the consequence that occurrence of bacterial disease is one
      of the highest in the world.

      Newborns can be infected during labour - when passing through the birth canal - and during
      the first days/weeks of life, as a consequence of the close physical contact with the
      mother, if the latter carries bacteria in the nasopharyngeal tract.

      If the mother is an important source of bacterial infection to the newborn, treating mothers
      with a powerful antibiotic during labour should decrease bacterial carriage and therefore
      diminish the risk of bacterial transmission to the newborn during the first days/weeks of
      life, which should in turn result in the lower occurrence of severe bacterial disease and
      hence lower mortality.

      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the impact of a single oral dose of azithromycin
      given to women in labour on bacterial carriage of the newborn as well as the women during
      the first month after delivery.

      The investigators have selected an antibiotic (azithromycin) that in sub-Saharan Africa has
      already shown both a strong impact on bacterial nasopharyngeal carriage and on all-cause
      mortality when administered to everybody in a community (mass drug administration). This
      specific antibiotic has several advantages for being deployable as a simple intervention in
      rural Africa, i.e. it requires a single oral administration, it has no special storage
      requirements and it has the potential to eliminate many of the bacteria commonly causing
      severe disease in newborn.

      This clinical trial will be conducted in a peri-urban health facility in Western Gambia. If
      an impact is shown, the next step would be to conduct a larger study aiming at establishing
      if the intervention, implemented at a lower level of care (most African women deliver at
      home assisted by traditional birth assistants), decreases the occurrence of neonatal
      bacterial disease

NCT01952470,Preliminary Study of Dornase Alpha to Treat Chest Infections Post Lung Transplant.,"
      Patients who have undergone lung transplantation are at an increased risk of developing
      chest infections due to long-term medication suppressing the immune response. In other
      chronic lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF) and bronchiectasis, inhaled, nebulised
      mucolytic medication such as dornase alpha and isotonic saline are often used as part of the
      management of lung disease characterized by increased or retained secretions. These agents
      act by making it easier to clear airway secretions, and are currently being used on a
      case-by-case basis post lung transplantation.

      To the investigators knowledge, these agents have not been evaluated via robust scientific
      investigation when used post lung transplant, yet are widely used in routine practice.
      Patients post lung transplant must be investigated separately as they exhibit differences in
      physiology that make the clearance of sputum potentially more difficult when compared to
      other lung diseases. Lower respiratory tract infections are a leading cause of hospital
      re-admission post lung transplant. Therefore, this highlights the need for a randomized
      controlled trial. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of dornase alpha, compared
      to isotonic saline, in the management of lower respiratory tract infections post lung
      transplant. Investigators hypothesize that dornase alpha will be more effective than
      isotonic saline.

      The effect of a daily dose of dornase alpha and isotonic saline will be compared over a
      treatment period of 1 month. Patients admitted to hospital suffering from chest infections
      characterized by sputum production post lung transplant will be eligible for study
      inclusion. Patients will be followed up through to 3 months in total to analyze short-medium
      term lasting effect. Investigators wish to monitor physiological change within the lung
      non-invasively via lung function analysis whilst assessing patient perceived benefit via
      cough specific quality of life questionnaires. These measures will be taken at study
      inclusion and repeated after 1 month and 3 months. Day to day monitoring will be performed
      via patient symptom diaries, incorporating hospital length of stay and exacerbation rate.

NCT02107001,Lung Ultrasound in Pleuritic Chest Pain,"
      Chest pain is an alarming symptom and one of the most frequent causes of access to the
      Emergency Departement. Although chest X-ray remains an essential step in the diagnostic
      process, several studies showed numerous limitations of radiography which frequently is
      inconclusive. Ultrasonography is a non-radiating imaging technique. Albeit a wide use of
      ultrasound, the utilization of ultrasound in the study of the lung has only recently been
      introduced in the clinical practice. Several studies proved that lung ultrasound is useful
      in the diagnosis of lung consolidation in community acquired pneumonia. Nowadays, ultrasound
      is not routinely used in the presence of chest pain. Our hypothesis based on clinical
      experience is that, in patients with pleuritic chest pain, lung ultrasound is very sensitive
      in detecting pneumonia and other lung diseases (such as pneumothorax) thus performing better
      than radiography. The primary aim of this study is to verify, in patients affected by
      pleuritic chest pain, the accuracy of lung ultrasound compared to chest-X-ray. The secondary
      aim is to evaluate the accuracy of lung ultrasound consolidations in distinguishing lung

      Community acquired pneumonia (CAP) is an important health problem with significant
      morbidity, mortality and cost. The most identified pathogen in CAP is Streptococcus
      pneumoniae. This was also the causative agent most frequently found in the Ovidius and
      Triple-P study, two consecutive clinical trials initiated by the St. Antonius Hospital
      Nieuwegein. Diagnosis of pneumococcal pneumonia can be based on positive blood cultures,
      sputum cultures, urine antigen testing or a serotype specific antibody response. When
      pneumococcal pneumonia is diagnosed by a positive culture, a matching serotype specific
      antibody response is expected. However not all patients in the Ovidius and Triple-P study
      with a culture proven pneumococcal pneumonia showed an antibody response against the
      infecting pneumococcal serotype. Patients who survived pneumococcal pneumonia are considered
      as a high-risk population for pneumococcal disease in the future. Possibly these patients
      have an impaired immune response against S. pneumoniae. In this study, pneumococcal
      vaccination of patients with S. pneumoniae CAP in the past enables investigating their
      immune response after vaccination compared to patients with CAP due another causative agent.
      Furthermore this study provides information to determine if there is a difference in
      vaccination response between pneumococcal pneumonia patients who had a culture matching
      serotype specific antibody response and between pneumococcal pneumonia patients who failed
      to elicit this response previously. Possibly these latter patients had a temporarily low

      impaired immune response against S. pneumoniae or certain serotypes.

NCT02244723,Diagnostic Value of Lung Ultrasound for Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia,"
      Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is the most common nosocomial infection acquired by

      clinical and economic consequences, as it is associated with considerable morbidity,
      increased mortality, and excess health care costs. Appropriate antibiotic therapy for

      This application is for support of a prospective, multi-centered study to evaluate the

NCT02264756,Improving Antibiotic Use in Hospitalized Patients With Pneumonia,"
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether an antimicrobial stewardship program can
      decrease the length of hospital stay for patients with pneumonia. The antimicrobial
      stewardship program is run by a pharmacist and doctor with extensive training in managing
      infectious diseases. These two health care professionals are responsible for reviewing the
      records of patients admitted to hospital with pneumonia, and then making specific
      recommendations to the patient's attending physician about how to manage antibiotic
      treatment. These recommendations might include discontinuing the antibiotic, or changing the
      way antibiotics are delivered from intravenous form to pill form, among many other potential
      options. The attending physician considers whether these recommendations should be followed
      or rejected. The study has a control group of patients who are not reviewed by the
      antimicrobial stewardship team, and their length of hospital stay will be compared to the
      reviewed group of patients. Any differences between these two groups will be assumed to be
      due to the impact of the antimicrobial stewardship program. So far, no previous study has
      been able to demonstrate that an antimicrobial stewardship program can reduce the length of
      stay of patients admitted to hospital with pneumonia. This study has some important
      differences from previous studies that may make its conclusions more accurately reflect the
      true impact of antimicrobial stewardship programs. The most important difference is how the
      timing of the review is modelled in the analysis of the study results. Because the timing of
      the review varies between patients, with some patients being reviewed at earlier and some at
      later times, this subtle difference, if not accounted for in the analysis, can mask a true
      positive effect of the program on length of stay. The investigators study will account for

NCT02467192,The Place of Imaging and Microbiology in the Diagnosis of Pneumonia in the Elderly,"
      Diagnosis of pneumonia in the elderly is difficult because of the poor sensitivity and
      specificity of clinical signs as well as images from chest radiography (RT). New diagnostic
      tools such as thoracic low-dose computed tomography (CT), which exposes the patient to a
      weak dose of irradiation, could improve diagnosis. Moreover, low-dose CT could provide
      additional accuracy in the etiological clarification of pneumonia in elderly people.

      As a first step, the investigators aim to perform a 1 year (12 months of inclusion + 3
      months of follow-up) prospective study including the Divisions of Internal Medicine,
      Rehabilitation, Geriatrics and Radiology of the University Hospitals of Geneva. In this
      study, patients >65 years old with a clinical suspicion of low respiratory tract infection
      (LRTI) will be included. They will be prescribed antimicrobial therapy. Both chest
      radiography and low-dose thoracic CT will be performed within the first 72 hours after
      admission, as will blood tests and a nasopharyngeal swab.

      The clinician's diagnosis, both before and after the results of the CT, will be compared at
      the end of the study to the adjudication committee's diagnostic opinion which will have
      access to all available clinical, laboratory and chest X-ray data and which will be
      considered the gold standard. At the end of the study, all the CT images will be
      blind-reviewed by two experts in radiology. The impact of CT scanning in the diagnosis of
      pneumonia will be assessed, both for its sensitivity and specificity in this population.

      During the first 12 months of the study, all patients will undergo a systematic
      nasopharyngeal swab at admission and at discharge, from which eluates will be conserved.
      During the next 12 months, virological and bacteriological polymerase chain reactions (PCR)
      will be performed, using new diagnostic tools, in order to determine the etiological
      diagnosis in this population and to evaluate the impact of the new tools in the management
      of pneumonia for this population.

      Analysis of these data will allow clinical, radiological and microbiological correlation.

NCT00313365,Surgical Lavage vs Serial Needle Aspiration for Infected Joints,"
      Joint spaces are aseptic areas, meaning that they do not contain microorganisms. Any injury
      to the joint space could cause the entry of microorganisms, with the potential to cause
      infection. Septic arthritis refers to the infection of a joint space with microorganisms,
      usually bacteria. This invasion initiates a process of inflammation and causes irreversible
      damage to a joint cavity. Patients typically present with pain, swelling, decreased motion,
      and inability to use the joint. When bacteria enter a joint space, the host immune system
      responds by concentrating inflammatory cells within the joint. While inflammatory cells
      serve to eliminate the bacteria, they also produce substances that not only attack bacteria
      but also could destroy the joint space. These substances are called enzymes, and they could
      damage the cartilage (translucent fairly elastic tissue around the joint) and adjacent bone
      in the process. Because cartilage has a poor ability to cure itself, this process may lead
      to irreversible damage and chronic joint dysfunction. Studies have found that signs of early
      joint damage can be found within hours following joint infection. This is true even if
      antibiotic therapy (medicine to fight the infection) is started within 24 hours of
      infection. Also, delay in treatment has been related to poor outcome. However, the best
      method of treating septic arthritis has yet to be determined. Currently, there are two
      accepted ways for treating septic arthritis: serial needle aspiration (introducing a needle
      in the joint to aspirate the inflammatory liquid), and surgical lavage (opening and cleaning
      the joint space in the OR under anesthesia). Antibiotics are also used with these two forms
      of treatment. Supporters of surgery believe that the most dependable method of eliminating
      bacteria from a joint space is through arthrotomy (opening the joint with a surgical
      incision) and lavage (irrigation of the joint with copious saline solution) .Promoters of
      serial needle aspiration support this method because it is quick, does not require opening
      the joint space, and can be performed without anesthesia.At present, there are no conclusive
      studies comparing the two techniques. Hopefully, this study will help delineate the best
      course of management.

      Primary:

        1. To evaluate the feasibility and potential usefulness of measuring early changes in
           tumor metabolic activity, assessed by Fludeoxyglucose-Positron Emission Tomography
           (FDG-PET) imaging and alkaline phosphatase activity, as early predictors of
           histological response rate at 12 weeks in osteosarcoma patients.

        2. To explore whether histological response can be assessed by a computer algorithm using
           virtual microscopic images of pathology material, and whether quantifying necrosis in
           this way correlates with microscope slide-based review.

      Secondary:

      1. To gather pilot data on the histological response rate, 3-year event-free survival, and
      toxicity when children and young adults with resectable osteosarcoma are treated using a
      chemotherapy regimen of alternating courses of doxorubicin/cisplatin (DC) and
      doxorubicin/ifosfamide/etoposide (IDE).

      All patients will receive 4 courses of preoperative chemotherapy courses. With the exception
      of high-dose methotrexate, which is given weekly, preoperative and postoperative
      chemotherapy courses are planned to begin every 21 days.

      Patients with good histological response (those patients with > 90% tumor necrosis at time
      of definitive resection) will receive three postoperative chemotherapy courses. The 1st will
      consist of doxorubicin, dexrazoxane, cisplatin and Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor
      (G-CSF)(or Polyethylene Glycol filgrastim). The 2nd course will consist of doxorubicin,

      The hypotheses of the present study of Freeman-Sheldon syndrome (FSS) and related conditions
      are: (1) that exercise capacity is lower in FSS patients versus normal controls, and the
      lower exercise capacity is due to changes in the muscles' normal structure and an inability
      of sufficient quantity of the energy molecule to bind to muscle; (2) this muscle problem
      reduces amount of air that can get in the lung and amount of oxygen carried in the blood,
      which then has the effect of increasing heart and respiration rates, blood pressure, and
      deep body temperature, and produces muscle rigidity; (3) the events noted above, when they

NCT01499784,Urinary Incontinence in an Inpatient Rehab Unit,"
      Urinary incontinence (UI) is a very common condition in women, with estimates of prevalence
      varying from 10% to 40% in most studies and showing a gradual increase with age. UI is a
      serious medical problem that can lead to urinary tract infections, low back pain,
      respiratory disorders, pressure sores, and an increased risk of falls. It also leads to
      social problems, creating embarrassment and negative self-perception for those who suffer
      from it. Women with urinary incontinence find themselves isolated and relatively inactive. A
      wide range of treatments has been used in the management of women's UI, including
      conservative interventions, pharmaceutical intervention, and surgery. A Cochrane Review from
      2008 stated that pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) is better than no treatment for UI and
      supports the recommendation that PFMT should be the first treatment line in conservative
      management programs for women with UI. Recently, there have been a few articles published
      that looked at the effectiveness of treating UI in a group-like setting with both behavioral
      modifications and pelvic floor exercises. One study was able to prove that group training of
      behavioral modification helped to reduce UI severity, increase pelvic floor strength, and
      reduce voiding frequency when compared to a control group.

      All of the studies cited were performed in community-dwelling persons with out-patient
      services and interventions. Dr. Fitzgerald and her colleagues from The Rehabilitation
      Institute of Chicago (RIC) were able to confirm in a poster presentation that many patients
      admitted to an inpatient rehabilitation facility do have UI. In 2005, out of 403,697
      Medicare beneficiaries admitted to a rehab hospital, 24% were incontinent. These studies
      were able to illustrate that UI affects all diagnoses. UI was shown to make a significant
      contribution to patient outcomes independent of functional status at admission. It is also a
      large determinant of discharge destination. In the United Kingdom in 2004, 62% of
      incontinent stroke patients were discharged to a sub acute home with only 5% placement for
      continent stroke survivors. Another study determined that urinary incontinence after having
      a stroke predicted a higher likelihood of an adverse outcome when controlled for age, type
      of stroke, and length of hospital stay. May, et. al., was able to state while in an acute
      rehab setting that patients with spinal cord injuries ranked bowel and bladder care, along
      with skin care, as most important in an education class with 12 different topics. This shows
      that patients find bladder function a large priority in their care, even in an in-patient
      setting. In the poster presentation mentioned above, many patients with UI in an acute care
      rehab setting do not improve Functional Independence Measure (FIM) status from admission to
      discharge. Currently there is no research available for the treatment of UI in an acute care
      rehab hospital, though it has been shown to be an issue with many of those admitted. So the
      question arises, ""Would addressing urinary incontinence with physical therapy interventions
      and behavioral modifications improve incontinence in this population during the acute rehab
      stage?""

      In this Phase II randomized controlled clinical trial, generally healthy male and female
      children from 24 through 59 months of age will be enrolled in Kamalapur (Dhaka), Bangladesh.
      The study is expected to continue for at least 6 months following vaccination. The
      experimental intervention is Serum Institute of India Ltd's Trivalent, Seasonal Live
      Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (SIIL LAIV). The study vaccine has been formulated according to
      WHO recommendations for the 2011-2012 Northern Hemisphere influenza season. The SIIL LAIV is
      administered in a 0.5 ml intranasal dose (one spray of 0.25 ml per nostril) via a reusable
      sprayer device and a single-use nozzle that produces a fine mist that is primarily deposited
      in the nose and nasopharynx. The comparator vaccine will be an inactive placebo identical in
      appearance to the active vaccine.

      The primary study hypothesis is that LAIV is safe and well tolerated by children aged 24
      through 59 months in Bangladesh. A secondary hypothesis is that LAIV is immunogenic among
      children receiving study vaccine as compared to children receiving placebo.

      PLEASE NOTE - THIS STUDY IS CURRENTLY ONLY RECRUITING PARTICIPANTS WITH OSTEOSARCOMA.

      The purpose of this study is to find the largest safe dose of GD2-T cells (also called
      iC9-GD2-CAR-VZV-CTLs), and additionally to evaluate if a VZV vaccine can improve the
      expansion and persistence of infused T cells, to learn what the side effects are, and to see
      whether this therapy might help patients with advanced sarcomas. Because there is no
      standard treatment for recurrent/refractory sarcomas at this time or because the currently
      used treatments do not work fully in all cases, patients are being asked to volunteer to
      take part in a gene transfer research study using special immune cells.

      The body has different ways of fighting infection and disease. No single way seems perfect
      for fighting cancers. This research study combines two different ways of fighting cancer:
      antibodies and T cells. Antibodies are types of proteins that protect the body from
      infectious diseases and possibly cancer. T cells, also called T lymphocytes, are special
      infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells, including cells infected with
      viruses and tumor cells. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with
      cancers. They have shown promise, but have not been strong enough to cure most patients.

      Investigators have found from previous research that a new gene can be put into T cells that
      will make them recognize cancer cells and kill them. Investigators now want to see if a new
      gene can be put in these cells that will let the T cells recognize and kill sarcoma cells.
      The new gene is called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) and consists of an antibody called
      14g2a that recognizes GD2, a protein that is found on sarcoma cells (GD2-CAR). In addition,
      it contains parts of the CD28 and OX40 genes which can stimulate T cells to make them live
      longer.

      Investigators have found that CAR-T cells can kill some of the tumor, but they don't last
      very long in the body and so the tumor eventually comes back. T cells that recognize the
      virus that causes chicken pox, varicella zoster virus (VZV), remain in the bloodstream for
      many years especially if they are stimulated or boosted by the VZV vaccine. Investigators
      will therefore insert the GD2-CAR gene into T cells that recognize VZV. These cells are
      called iC9-GD2-CAR-VZV-specific T cells but are referred to as GD2-T cells for simplicity.

NCT02018952,Ultrasonography Assessment of Septic Arthritis on Native Joint,"
      The aim of this trial is to study the interest of ultrasonography among patients with septic
      arthritis.

      Currently, ultrasonography is useful for detecting small fluid effusions, for examining
      otherwise inaccessible joints, such as the hip and for helping the joint aspiration.

      Accurate assessment of disease activity and joint damage in septic arthritis is important
      for monitoring treatment efficiency and for prediction of the outcome of the disease.

      Nowadays, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides better resolution than radiography or
      tomography for the detection of joint effusion and for differentiation between bone and soft
      tissue infectious. The sensibility is reported to be nearly 100% with a specificity of more
      than 75%.

      However, MRI is expensive and not rapidly accessible.

      Therefore, ultrasonography, a non invasive, painless, inexpensive, and non radiating exam
      can be used to assess the presence and extent of inflammation, destruction, and tissue
      response.

      The objective is to describe, using ultrasonography, the abnormalities joint structure
      influenced the septic arthritis evolution and prognosis.

      The investigators hope, at the end of this study, to evaluate ultrasonography interest in
      septic arthritis and to establish ultrasonography prognosis factors to predict treatment
      efficiency and functional outcome.

NCT02067078,Protracted Effect of Combined Nerve Blocks After Total Knee Arthroplasty,"
      Purpose:

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the postoperative analgesic effect of a combined
      Saphenous nerve block and Obturator nerve block with local infiltration analgesia in the
      tissue around the knee after surgery with knee replacement. In the combined nerve blocks we
      use a mixture of Bupivacaine, Adrenaline, Clonidine and Dexamethasone (""protracted mixture"")
      and the local infiltration consist of Ropivacaine, Adrenaline and Toradol. Our hypothesis is
      that the combined nerve blocks with protracted mixture prolongs block duration, reduces pain
      and reduces the need for morphine and thus reduce side effects such as nausea, vomiting and
      lethargy compared to the current treatment with local infiltration analgesia.

      Background:

      Nerve blocks as analgesic treatment after orthopedic surgery is a recognized and proven
      procedure. The nerve blocks have the disadvantage that not only do they anesthetize the
      sensory nerve fibers but also the nerve fibers to the muscles of the leg. The Saphenous
      nerve block causes only stunning of sensory nerves to the knee region. The Obturator nerve
      block causes both stunning of the sensory nerves to the knee region and the thighs inward
      leading muscles, and does not affect the patient's mobilization capacity.

      Both blocks are known to be a good addition to the analgesic treatment. Bupivacaine is a
      well-known local anesthetic. Adrenaline, Clonidine and Dexamethasone have also been used in
      other studies, in addition to the local anesthetic agent, and has been shown to prolong the
      effect of the nerve block. Saphenous and Obturator nerve block with all four drugs
      Bupivacaine, Adrenaline, Clonidine and Dexamethasone has not been systematically
      investigated in knee replacement surgery, and it is not known whether this method will
      provide better pain treatment.

      Method

      The patient can receive one of three treatments, determined randomly:

        -  A. Saphenous and Obturator nerve block with active anesthetics (Bupivacaine,
           Adrenaline, Clonidine, Dexamethasone) and local block around the knee joint with
           placebo medicine (normal saline).

        -  B. Saphenous block with active anesthetics and both Obturator nerve block and local
           block around the knee joint with placebo medicine (normal saline).

        -  C. Both block with placebo medicine (normal saline) and local block around the knee
           joint with effective local anesthetic.

      Neither patient, investigator or staff around the patient will have knowledge of which
      treatment the patient has received.

NCT02107963,A Phase I Trial of T Cells Expressing an Anti-GD2 Chimeric Antigen Receptor in Children and Young Adults With GD2+ Solid Tumors,"
      Background

      GD2 is a well-characterized tumor antigen in neuroblastoma, which is also expressed on
      osteosarcomas and some other sarcomas. T cells expressing 1st generation anti-GD2 chimeric
      antigen receptors (CARs) were safe and mediated modest antitumor activity in some patients
      with refractory neuroblastoma.

      A 3rd generation anti-GD2-CAR (GD2-CAR.OX40.28.z.ICD9) has been produced and holds promise
      for increased activity compared to the 1st generation GD2-CAR already studied in clinical
      trials. As an added safety measure, the vector includes a suicide switch comprising a
      caspase dimerization domain (ICD9) that can be activated by a small molecule to induce death
      of the genetically engineered cells if they were induce untoward toxicity.

      Objectives

      Primary:Determine the feasibility of producing anti GD2-CAR cells meeting the established
      release criteria and to assess the safety of administering escalating doses of anti-GD2-CAR
      engineered T cells in children and young adults with GD2+ solid tumors, including
      neuroblastoma, following cyclophosphamide-based lymphodepletion.

      Secondary:

        1. Determine if administration anti-GD2-CAR engineered T cells mediate antitumor effects
           in children and young adults with GD2+ solid tumors;

        2. Measure persistence of adoptively transferred anti-GD2-CAR T cells and correlate this
           with antitumor effects;

        3. Extend information regarding the prevalence and intensity of GD2 expression in
           non-neuroblastoma, non-osteosarcoma solid tumors in children and young adults;

        4. If unacceptable toxicity occurs that is possibly, probably or likely related to
           anti-GD2-CAR T cells, assess the capacity for AP1903, a dimerizing agent, to mediate
           clearance of the genetically engineered cells and resolve toxicity; and

        5. Assess toxicity of AP1903 if administered to mediate clearance of anti-GD2-CAR T cells.

      Eligibility

      Patients 1-35 years of age, at least 15 kg, with osteosarcoma or a GD2+ solid tumor
      (including neuroblastoma) that has recurred after or not responded to standard therapy and
      is deemed incurable by standard therapy.

      Design

      After apheresis to collect T cells for transduction, patients receive cyclophosphamide
      1800mg/m(2)/d as a lymphodepleting regimen. A phase I cell dose escalation scheme will used
      at 4 dose levels (1 x 10(5) transduced T cells/kg; 1 x 10(6) transduced T cells/kg; 3 x
      10(6) transduced T cells/kg; and 1 x 10(7) transduced T cells/kg), using a standard 3 plus 3
      dose escalation design. An expanded group of a total of 12 patients will be treated at the
      highest dose, comprising at least 6 osteosarcoma patients.

      Patients will be monitored for toxicity, antitumor effects and persistence of anti-GD2-CAR T
      cells.

      Patients with a PR, SD may receive a 2nd cycle at the next higher dose level a minimum of 60
      days following completion of the first cycle if eligibility criteria are met.

      A maximum of 36 patients may be treated on this study. Given that there is likelihood that
      some patients with non-osteosarcoma will not meet the criteria for GD2 expression to be
      eligible for enrollment, up to 72 subjects will be screened to enroll a maximum of 36
      patients for treatment. Up to 2-3 patients will be accrued per month, and therefore this
      study may require up to 2-3 years to complete enrollment and treatment.

      The Lokomat is a robotic treadmill gait trainer that is used to help people who have
      neurologic conditions walk better. Early research with children with cerebral palsy (CP)
      shows that it may help to improve walking skills. The purpose of this two-group randomized
      study is to compare Lokomat training to regular physiotherapy (PT) as far as impact on
      walking abilities and related function. The primary (alternate) hypothesis is that children
      will improve more with Lokomat training in terms of gross motor skills and walking
      endurance.

      The investigators are enrolling 40 ambulatory children who are ages 5 to 12 years, have CP
      and are in Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) Level II (n=20) or III (n=20).
      In this crossover randomized clinical trial (RCT), whether PT or Lokomat intervention is
      done first is decided by an independent randomization process that occurs after the first
      baseline assessment. In the Lokomat phase, children receive 8 to 10 weeks of twice weekly
      therapy for a maximum of 16 sessions. Each session is 35 minutes plus the time needed for
      set-up. The 35 minute PT program is also given twice weekly for 8 to 10 weeks for a maximum
      of 16 sessions, and focuses on a menu-based strength, co-ordination, fitness, walking and
      balance activities. There is a 6 week break between the Lokomat and PT interventions.

      Each child has four study assessments during their ~6 months in the study. The first
      assessment is done before starting the Lokomat or physiotherapy phase. The second happens
      after the first intervention has finished. The child then has a 6-week break period. The
      third assessment is done at the end of this break, and the fourth occurs after the second
      intervention. The PT assessor who does these assessments will not be the same as the PT who
      gives the intervention. The assessor is blinded to the child's intervention phase and
      previous assessment results. The primary outcome measures are the Gross Motor Function
      Measure and 6 minute walk test. Secondary measures evaluate gait, functional abilities,
      participation, health related quality of life and individualized goals.

      The randomized aspect of the study lets us look at outcome differences between children for
      Lokomat and PT within their first intervention phase (n=20/group). The cross-over phase
      evaluates within-child outcomes across the two phases. A qualitative component is
      concurrently underway to examine child/parent experiences and their views of Lokomat
      outcomes.

      This is an un-blinded Phase 1 study in which 21 patients suffering from solid advanced
      paediatric malignancies (14 sarcoma and 7 non-sarcoma patients) are treated with AV0113, an
      anti-tumour immune therapy with autologous Dendritic Cells (DCs) loaded with tumour cell
      lysates, in order to investigate its safety and feasibility.

      For obtaining a clearer picture of AV0113's utility in the treatment of bone and soft tissue
      sarcoma, a long-term (LT) follow-up investigation of the 14 sarcoma patients, which will be
      treated using the AV0113 Dendritic Cell Cancer Immune Therapy (DC-CIT) technology is
      planned, in order to gather first evidence for a potential LT effect of DC-CIT with AV0113.

NCT00131716,Prevention of Severe Anaemia in Gambian Children,"
      Severe anaemia is a frequent cause of admission to hospitals in tropical Africa and about
      10% of such children die. In endemic countries, anaemia has multiple causes such as
      nutritional deficiencies, infections and haemoglobinopathies. However, Plasmodium falciparum
      infection is believed to be the major contributory factor to the aetiology of severe
      anaemia. Severe anaemia is usually treated by blood transfusion although transfusion carries
      the attendant risk of transmission of HIV and other blood-borne infections. Thus, there is a
      need to explore novel strategies to reduce the incidence of severe anaemia in high-risk
      groups such as children with suboptimal haemoglobin levels because these children are at
      increased risk of developing severe anaemia if they develop a malaria infection before their
      haemoglobin level has normalized. Therefore, it is proposed to study whether monthly
      chemoprophylaxis with sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine (S/P) given during malaria transmission
      season can protect Gambian children from developing severe anaemia. After receiving
      treatment from the hospital, 1200 children admitted to the hospital with a haematocrit of
      less than 21% were randomised to receive either monthly S/P or placebo during the rest of
      the malaria transmission season. Morbidity was monitored throughout the rainy season. Study
      subjects were seen at the end of the dry season to document morbidity and mortality.

      Malaria is fatal and increases the risk of death among children with sickle cell anemia.
      Chemoprophylaxis significantly improves quality of life in these children. In Uganda
      Chloroquine is the drug of choice for prophylaxis and yet it's effectiveness is limited due
      to high levels of resistance throughout the country. Intermittent presumptive treatment with
      sulfadoxine - Pyrimethamine a new approach to malaria prevention, has shown great potential
      in reducing incidence of malaria and anaemia among high risk groups such as pregnant women
      and infants. However no studies have been done in Uganda to determine if presumptive
      treatment with sulfadoxine- pyrimethamine reduces the incidence of malaria in children with
      sickle cell anaemia.

      Hypothesis : Presumptive treatment with sulfadoxine- Pyrimethamine is better than weekly
      chloroquine in reducing incidence of malaria in children with sickle cell anaemia.

NCT00439595,A Trial of 2 'Point of Care' Diagnostic Methods to Improve Detection and Treatment of Anaemia in African Children,"
      A high proportion of children under the age of 5 years and pregnant women in Tanzania is
      anaemic, particularly in areas of high malaria transmission. The symptoms of anaemia are
      often non-specific or absent and clinical judgement is generally insensitive in estimating
      Hb levels, especially in infants who are assessed by basic grade health staff. Thus while
      treatment for the common causes of anaemia is available, many cases are not treated due to
      difficulties in recognising anaemia.

      New diagnostic tools can increase the sensitivity of anaemia detection compared to clinical
      diagnosis but no studies have demonstrated their effectiveness in increasing case-detection
      and treatment of anaemic patients at the first level of healthcare. In addition, the costs
      of their use in relation to any increase in numbers of cases treated are not known and this
      knowledge is needed to guide public health decisions.

      Two methods of measuring anaemia are currently suitable for use at the first level of care;
      Copack Haemoglobin colour scale (HBCS) and Hemocue portable photometry. We propose to
      compare the effectiveness in basic health facilities of these 2 simple diagnostic tools
      compared to control dispensaries (current practice) in increasing rates of detection and
      treatment of anaemia in children under the age of 5 years and pregnant women over the course
      of 1 year in a cluster-randomised trial in 30 dispensaries in a malaria-endemic area of NE

NCT00473837,Chloroquine and Post Malaria Anaemia Study,"
      The pathogenesis of post-malaria anaemia is multifactorial. Iron supplementation remains the
      mainstay of management of moderate and severe anaemia; however the management of mild
      anaemia (Hb 80-110g/l) is problematic as population supplementation studies of children in
      malaria endemic areas demonstrate adverse effects in children with mild anaemia. We
      hypothesize that the anti-inflammatory, anti-malarial and anti-macrophageal iron loading
      effects of chloroquine could make it a useful drug in the management of mild post malaria
      anaemia. To test this hypothesis, we plan to randomize children (aged 12 months to 6 years)
      with post malaria anaemia (Hb 70-110g/l) to receive a standard anti-malarial treatment,
      co-artemether . All children with parasitologic cure after three days on treatment will be
      randomised to receive either weekly chloroquine or weekly placebo starting from day 10 till
      day 90. By comparing the curve of haemoglobin change between day 3 and day 30 in the placebo
      arms of the two groups, we will test the effect of chloroquine vs. ACT treatment on
      macrophageal iron loading and release in acute clinical malaria. By comparing the
      haemoglobin change between day 3 and day 90 between the weekly chloroquine arms and the
      weekly placebo arms we will test the longer-term anti-inflammatory and anti- malarial
      effects of weekly chloroquine prophylaxis. In addition to the primary endpoint, we plan to
      assess potential mechanisms of action by determining parasite clearance, peripheral cytokine
      production and iron flux

NCT00944684,High Dose Ribavirin in the Treatment of Chronic Hepatitis C,"
      Treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis C infected with genotype 1 hepatitis C virus
      (HCV) consists of combined peginterferon/ribavirin for 48 weeks. Approximately 50% of
      patients experience sustained virological response which equals cure. All other patients
      either do not respond or experience recurrence of HCV virus and chronic hepatitis. Important
      predictors of successful treatment are sustained dosing of both peginterferon and ribavirin.
      With regard to the latter, clinical evidence indicates that higher ribavirin doses may in
      fact even improve treatment outcome. However, high ribavirin doses cause hemolytic anemia
      which require dose reductions. Recent clinical experience show that erythropoetic growth
      factors, including erythropoetin, can counteract hemolytic anemia caused by antiviral
      treatment in chronic hepatitis C patients. Therefore, the current trial aims to test whether
      higher ribavirin doses adapted to a target plasma concentrations instead of a weight-based
      dosing result in better healing rates, and whether ribavirin-associated hemolytic anemia can
      be compensated by concommitant erythropoetin treatment.

      Using a randomized, controlled, open-label design, the investigators hypothesize that
      patients with high ribavirin doses adapted to plasma levels experience better viral
      clearance than patients treated with standard weight-based ribavirin doses. In addition, the
      investigators hypothesize that erythropoetin treatment will counteract hemolytic anemia
      induced by ribavirin thereby allowing maintenance of target plasma concentrations without
      ribavirin dose reductions.

NCT01050361,Echocardiography Management for Patients Requiring Care for Non-Cardiac Surgery,"
      The growing population of University of Nebraska Medical Center patients with heart failure
      combined with the increasing number of surgical procedures performed each year supports the
      need for a critical analysis of how to most appropriately manage these patients during the
      perioperative period, especially for non-cardiac surgery. Echo-guided hemodynamic management
      (EGHEM) is the use of echocardiography data to normalize and/or optimize in real-time,
      cardiac output and ventricular filling pressures in the perioperative period for non-cardiac
      surgical cases. The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that EGHEM compared to
      standard management practices will result in a reduced length of hospital stay in the
      noncardiac surgery population. The primary goal of health care providers for patients
      requiring anesthetic care, perioperative care, or critical care is ensuring the adequacy of
      the patient's circulatory function by optimizing cardiac output and ventricular filling
      pressure. Currently, the use of the ECG monitor and systemic blood pressure are the standard
      of care for assessing circulatory function. However, those data cannot provide accurate
      information on cardiac output and ventricular filling pressure for patients with
      cardiovascular risk factors and/or comorbidities. As a result, managing the hemodynamic
      parameters of these patients, as well as their intravenous fluid needs and resuscitation
      strategy, we hypothesize that using traditional approaches may lead to significant volume
      overload and post-operative cardiovascular complications and morbidity. In this study we
      propose an EGHEM strategy that incorporates standard echocardiography generated data points
      in addition to the systemic blood pressure and ECG signal to assess, manage, modify and
      optimize patient cardiac preload, afterload, heart rate and contractility in the
      perioperative period. Based on our initial observations and preliminary data using the EGHEM
      approach, we hypothesize that we can demonstrate a significant decrease in hospital length
      of stay and an overall decrease in perioperative morbidity at 30 days in the non-cardiac
      surgery population using EGHEM compared to standard practices. In this proposal we have
      designed a single center, prospective, randomized clinical trial to test our hypothesis.

      The conventional treatment in warm-antibody dependent autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AIHA)
      is high-dose glucocorticoid, but in more than half of the patients, haemolytic activity will
      recur after end of treatment or during the gradual reduction in dose of the drug. As a
      result, many patients will finally be splenectomized or be treated with long-term
      glucocorticoids or other immunosuppressive drugs as azathioprine or cyclophosphamide. Recent
      studies have shown however, that some patients will respond to treatment with the chimeric
      anti-CD 20 antibody Rituximab and is some cases, the response is permanent. In most of the
      studies, Rituximab has been used in refractory disease or at least as second line treatment.

      and mortality rates remain high and the diagnosis is still too late.Considering that the
      chronic human papillomavirus (HPV) related genital infection leads to cervical cancer
      development, cervical cancer should be the target of primary prevention through vaccination.

      PROJECT OBJECTIVES: This project aims to evaluate de following vaccination indicators: 1)
      Program acceptance rate; 2) Vaccine coverage rate; 3) Three-dose completion rate; 4) Rescue
      vaccination demand; 5) Adverse event rate;

      TARGET POPULATION: Schoolgirls attending the 6th and 7th grades of elementary school (mean
      age = 11.9 yo).

      VACCINATION PROGRAM: The program adopted the quadrivalent vaccine because it is considered
      superior to the bivalent vaccine in preventing HPV-induced lesions. In addition to
      preventing the development of pre-cancer lesions and cervical cancer, the quadrivalent
      vaccine has also proved to be effective in preventing condyloma, and vaginal and vulvar

      micronutrient powders (Sprinkles being the most widely recognized) along with nutrition
      education. While this intervention has proven to be safe, effective, and efficacious in
      numerous other countries, a specific national protocol must be developed to maximize its
      effect on reducing anaemia in Zambian children. The proposed research aims to inform such

NCT01985243,Building Capacity for Sustainable Livelihoods and Health,"
      Despite recent economic growth in Ghana, the prevalence of childhood malnutrition remains
      high. Wasting prevalence affected 29% among 6- to 8-months-old infants in 2008. Poor
      nutrition contributes to about one-third of child mortality, diminishes cognitive
      development, and is a major determinant of maternal mortality. The specific objectives of
      the 5-year project are to: (1) enhance human capacity of government, civil, and private
      institutions through improvement of knowledge and skills of personnel in agriculture,
      nutrition and health, entrepreneurship, and pedagogy; (2) identify information needs of
      local institutions that are not presently met and develop a representative and sustainable
      longitudinal data system to support evidence-based decision-making in programs; (3) increase
      vulnerable households' access to quality services in agriculture/fisheries, nutrition and
      health, and finance; (4) implement integrated intervention activities to improve infant and
      young child and adolescent nutrition outcomes; and (5) examine differential benefits of the
      interventions for diverse vulnerable populations. The project comprises two major
      activities: part I - the creation of a longitudinal data system to support evidence-based
      decision-making in programs, and part II - the implementation of intervention activities to
      improve nutrition outcomes.

      The survey will include demographic, socioeconomic, health, diet, and nutritional status
      information collected annually from a representative same of 1500 households with infants
      (0-12 mo) and 1500 households with adolescents (9-12 y). The data will be analyzed and
      presented rapidly each year to district program and policy leaders to assist them in

      The purpose of this double-blind pivotal clinical utility study is to determine on a large
      patient population whether heart murmurs can be reliably detected with high sensitivity and
      specificity using a locked, automated algorithm-based phonocardiogram analysis (also
      referred to as computer aided auscultation (CAA)).

      Each patient is auscultated and diagnosed independently by a medical specialist.
      Additionally, for each patient, an echocardiogram is performed as the gold-standard for
      determining heart pathologies. The CAA results are compared to the findings of the medical
      professionals as well as to the echocardiogram findings.

      Hypothesis: The specific (locked) CAA algorithms used in this study are able to
      automatically diagnose pathological heart murmurs in premature babies and newborns with at
      least the same accuracy as experienced medical specialists.

NCT02222805,Effect of Timing of Umbilical Cord Clamping on Anaemia at 8 and 12 Months and Later Neurodevelopment,"
      The investigators plan a study to randomize 540 children in Nepal to early (≤30 seconds) or
      late (≥180 seconds) clamping of the umbilical cord at birth. The children will be followed
      with blood tests (hemoglobin and ferritin) at 8 and 12 months of age, and their development
      is evaluated by questionnaire (Ages & Stages Questionnaire ) at 12 months of age, and by
      testing (Bayley -III) at 18-24 months of age. By implementing the project in a country with
      a high proportion of anemia at one year of age (about 75%), we can reduce the number of
      children in the study and still achieve significant results.

      Iron deficiency is a global health problem and causes anemia and impaired neurodevelopment
      in children. Anemia is estimated by WHO to occur among 25% of all children before school
      age, and the corresponding figure in Europe is 3-9 %.

      By waiting 3 minutes to clamp the cord after birth, a large part of the child's blood volume
      remaining in the placenta is transfused over to the child's body. Research shows that the
      neonate's blood volume can increase by about 40% and this blood contains 3 to 4 months'
      supply of iron. In Sweden, we have shown that late clamping of the umbilical cord could
      reduce iron deficiency in children at four months of age by 90%. Globally, most countries
      practice early cord clamping and the child is deprived of the placental blood transfusion.
      The hypothesis of the study is that by delaying the clamping of the umbilical cord, anemia
      at 8 and 12 months will be reduced an this in turn will be beneficial for the childrens
      development.

      The project will be implemented at Paropakar Maternity and Women 's Hospital, Kathmandu. It
      hosts approximately 23,000 births annually.

NCT02276690,Hepcidine and Iron Deficiency in Critically Ill Patients,"
      Anaemia is very frequent among critically ill patients, concerning more than 60 % of them at
      admission and more than 80% at intensive care unit discharge. Iron deficiency is also
      frequent at admission, with prevalence around 25 to 40%. During their stay in Intensive Care
      Unit, critically ill patients are exposed to repeated blood samples and to other blood
      losses (daily blood loss has been evaluated to be as high as 128 ml/day in median), this
      leads to direct iron loss. Prevalence of iron deficiency may thus be very important at
      Intensive Care Unit discharge. However, iron deficiency diagnosis is complicated in these
      patients, since inflammation induces an increase in plasma ferritin levels and a decrease in
      transferrin saturation, the two usual markers of iron deficiency. As a consequence, iron
      deficiency is usely under-diagnosed in these patients. Treatment of iron deficiency may be
      indicated to correct anaemia but also to improve patients fatigue and muscular weakness. The
      characterization of iron metabolism regulation by the hormone hepcidin opened new ways for
      the understanding and the follow-up of these complex clinical situations (combining
      inflammation and iron deficiency). Indeed, iron deficiency is associated with a decrease in
      hepcidin synthesis, while iron overload induces hepcidin synthesis. Furthermore, low
      hepcidin levels are required to mobilize iron from stores. Hepcidin has thus be proposed as
      a marker of iron deficiency in critically ill patients. To date, standard immunological
      methods of hepcidin quantitation are only proposed in the reasearch setting and could not be
      proposed in the clinical setting because it is too expensive. New approaches for hepcidin
      quantification, based on mass spectrometry are proposed and may be routinely implemented. We
      make the hypothesis that treating iron deficiency in critically ill anemic patients,
      diagnosed by hepcidin quantification, may improve the post-Intensive Care Unit
      rehabilitation, and may thus reduce post-Intensive Care Unit cost linked to hospital stay
      and anaemia treatment.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the medical economic interest of a new diagnostic
      method for iron deficiency, based on a quantitative dosage of hepcidin by mass spectrometry
      in critically ill anaemic patients.

      algorithm that automatically classifies murmurs of phonocardiograms (PCGs) as either
      pathologic (AHA class I) or as no- or innocent (AHA class III) in the pediatric population.

      Each patient is auscultated and diagnosed independently by a medical specialist by means of

      Background:

        -  Infection by tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is a significant health concern for
           humans in Europe and Asia. A vaccine is available in these regions and in Canada, but
           not in the United States. Research studies in Europe have shown the vaccine to be
           effective in preventing infection among the general population, where disease is
           transmitted either by the bite of an infected tick (most common) or by ingestion of
           contaminated unpasteurized milk or milk products. Persons who work with the virus in a
           research setting, however, have the potential of being exposed in unnatural ways, and
           may come into contact with concentrations of virus higher than those found naturally in
           ticks.

        -  The Food and Drug Administration is investigating the effectiveness of the existing
           vaccine. It is a killed vaccine, which means that it has been treated to ensure that it
           does not contain live agents (bacteria or virus). The manufacturer has tested the
           product for other possible contaminating agents and none have been detected. However,
           there is an unknown but small risk of exposure to undetected contaminating agents in
           the vaccine.

      Objectives:

        -  To test the safety and immune response to a vaccine against tick-borne encephalitis
           virus (TBEV).

        -  To add a level of protection to persons who may have occupational exposure to TBEV to
           reduce their chances of developing infection from that exposure.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals 18 years of age or older who are in generally good health and have the
      potential for occupational exposure to TBEV at one of the two National Institute of Allergy
      and Infectious Diseases campuses.

      Design:

        -  Subjects receiving the full series of the vaccine will receive at least three doses by
           injection in the upper arm. The first and third dose of study vaccine will be given in
           the muscle of the nondominant arm. The second dose will be given in the dominant arm.

        -  Participation will include at least 12 scheduled visits to the study center over
           approximately 3.5 years.

        -  An initial visit will take place 7 to 21 days prior to the first injection. Blood
           samples will be taken to test liver and kidney function, baseline antibody levels, and
           for possible pregnancy in female participants.

        -  Doses will be given on days 0, 14, and 161. Participants will be asked to complete a
           diary card on each day for one week following the vaccination to assess any reactions
           or side effects. At each visit after receipt of a vaccine, participants will be asked
           about any side effects.

        -  Blood will be drawn 14 days after the second injection and 21 days after the third
           injection in order to measure the level of antibodies and overall response to the
           vaccine.

        -  Subjects who develop a sufficiently high level of antibodies may (at the discretion of
           the laboratory chief) be allowed to work with strains of TBEV at Biosafety Level (BSL)
           3 rather than BSL-4. Blood will be drawn annually for 3 years to determine antibody
           level and response to the vaccine. Booster doses will be provided if required.

NCT01862822,Position of Children During Urine Collection: Evaluation Study,"
      Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a frequently suspected cause of fever in young children,
      justifying urine cultures. Sampling procedures are decisive for the reliability of UTI
      diagnosis. Even though official guidelines recommend clean catch method, catheterization or
      suprapubic aspiration, urine bag collection remains widely used. In our experience, the rate
      of contaminated bag-obtained cultures reaches 30.2 %. In a recent study, the investigators
      have noticed that the rate of contaminated urine cultures was lower when children were kept
      in an upright position at the time of urine collection. The upright position could explain
      this decrease, perineum being less in contact with urine. These results are borderline
      significant, the investigators would like to confirm them with a specific study.

NCT01954940,Whole Body Vibration Therapy in Boys With Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy,"
      Whole-body vibration therapy (WBVT) is a novel, non-pharmacological intervention aimed at
      improving muscle strength and endurance as well as bone density. It holds promise for
      children with neuromuscular disorders such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) since muscle
      weakness results not only from muscle breakdown but also physical inactivity and muscle
      disuse atrophy. Weak DMD patients may increasingly limit their physical activity due to fear
      of falling or loss of independence (e.g. difficulty rising to stand without assistance).
      Prolonging the length of time boys with DMD are ambulatory is important for delaying
      complications of this disease (lung hypoventilation, scoliosis) as well as maintaining bone
      health. We propose to conduct a pilot study of WBVT in young boys with Duchenne muscular
      dystrophy (DMD). The primary outcome will be to document safety and feasibility of WBVT in
      this patient population. The secondary outcomes will evaluate changes in muscle strength and
      endurance. Bone health will also be examined as part of routine clinical care. The study
      will include 20 ambulatory boys with DMD; patients will be randomized (1:1 allocation) into
      2 groups: WBVT treatment or no WBVT treatment (controls). Treatment groups will consist of
      10 boys undergoing daily WBVT in an 8-week, open-label trial.

NCT02421523,Strength Training in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy,"
      Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a debilitating neuromuscular disease that causes muscle
      breakdown, weakness, and eventual death. Over the last 40 years parents have received little
      guidance on the potential of exercise as a therapeutic strategy to maintain muscle function.
      It is well known that high intensity exercise and eccentric contractions can result in
      muscle damage in dystrophic muscle, yet the absence of muscle loading will conversely result
      in muscle wasting. Recent research in rodent models and milder forms of muscular dystrophy
      supports earlier studies that resistance exercise may have beneficial effects for
      maintenance of muscle mass in dystrophic muscle. However, careful and systematic
      investigation into the safety and feasibility of resistance exercise is needed to consider
      its implementation in boys with DMD.

      The goal of this project is to assess the safety and feasibility of a home based mild to
      moderate-intensity strengthening exercise program in boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy
      (DMD). Evidence from milder forms of muscular dystrophy and mouse models of DMD suggests
      that strengthening exercise may be beneficial for these children, but this area has not been
      adequately explored using human subjects. The results of this study should provide
      information to assist in the development of scientifically based recommendations concerning
      optimal exercise parameters for patients with DMD.

NCT02463942,Tick-borne Encephalitis and Positive Borrelial Antibodies,"
      In Slovenia, tick-borne encephalitis and Lyme borreliosis are both endemic diseases with
      high incidence rates and they are both transmitted by a bite of infected Ixodes ricinus
      tick. In clinical practice, tick-borne encephalitis is confirmed by demonstration of
      tick-borne encephalitis antibodies in serum of a patient with compatible clinical
      presentation and cerebrospinal pleocytosis. Patients with Lyme meningitis or
      meningoradiculitis also have cerebrospinal pleocytosis, however the presence of borrelial
      antibodies in serum does not attest Lyme neuroborreliosis.

      Patients with tick-borne encephalitis and positive borrelial antibodies in serum, but not
      fulfilling criteria for Lyme neuroborreliosis, are often being treated with antibiotics in
      several European countries due to the possibility of double infection. The investigators
      hypothesise that such patients do not benefit from antibiotics. Such an approach may appear
      safe regarding the possibility of borrelial infection, however it can also be associated
      with detrimental consequences such as antibiotic related adverse reactions, negative
      epidemiological impact on bacterial resistance, and intravenous catheter related
      complications.

NCT00299663,Long Term Follow-up of Patients With Group A Streptococcal Infection Originating From the Genital Tract,"
      Group A streptococcus (GAS) causes a variety of human infections. It is also an uncommon but
      serious cause of postpartum infections. In contrast to group B streptococcus (GBS)
      infection, which causes illness and death in newborns disproportionately more often than it
      does in mothers, perinatal GAS infection primarily affects mothers . Invasive GAS infection
      is defined by the isolation of GAS from a normally sterile site (e.g., blood) or by the
      isolation of GAS from a nonsterile site in the presence of the streptococcal toxic shock
      syndrome or necrotizing fasciitis. A postpartum case of invasive GAS is defined as isolation
      of GAS during the postpartum period, in association with a clinical postpartum infection
      (e.g., endometritis) or from either a sterile site or a wound infection.

      Because of the burden and severity of invasive GAS infection, the Centers for Disease
      Control and Prevention (CDC) hosted a meeting in to formulate guidelines for responding to
      postpartum and postsurgical GAS infections. However, we could not find any recommendations
      for long-term follow-up of patients who had GAS infection subsequent to delivery or
      gynaecological procedures, or further recommendations regarding subsequent delivery or
      gynaecological invasive procedures. It is possible that women who had GAS as a cause of
      vaginal infection may have a tendency to be carriers of this organism, but this has never
      been proven. We believe it is of importance to determine if women who have had one infection
      may be long-term carriers which may pose a risk during future pregnancies.

      The objective of the present study is to evaluate the incidence of long term gynaecological
      carrier state of patients who had GAS invasive infection following delivery, and to provide
      guidelines for follow-up and treatment of such patients.

      The proposed study may answer the question whether this endogenous GAS origin represents
      chronic GAS carrier state, similar to the known GBS carrier state. As some of these patients
      had severe infections (sometimes life threatening) a protocol for long-term follow up and
      management is necessary in case an invasive procedure is done (IUD insertion, endometrial
      biopsy, curettage or delivery) in order to prevent recurrent infection. The information
      collected in the study will enable us to afford recommendations for follow up and
      prophylaxis in the future.

      In areas of the world where populations are undernourished poor oral health is prevalent.
      Diets rich in fruit and vegetables are thought to have many health benefits including
      reducing the risk of oral cancer or gum disease. In particular fruits such as strawberries
      contain many different compounds which may be responsible for these proposed health
      benefits.

      From this study, the researchers hope to gain information about how the tissues in the mouth
      absorb strawberry gummies in a population of habitually smoking and never smoking men and
      women. The researchers will measure inflammation hormones in your saliva and urine and the
      genes in your mouth and blood. Two different strawberry gummies will be tested in this

      Technology. One type of strawberry gummy will contain freeze-dried whole strawberries while
      the other type will have no fruit. In total the eight pieces of strawberry gummies that you
      will consume in one day will be at most equal to 1 cup of whole strawberries. The research

NCT02114099,Trial of Atorvastatin on the Persistent Coronary Aneurysm in Children With Kawasaki Disease,"
      Background Kawasaki disease (KD) is characterized by fever, bilateral nonexudative
      conjunctivitis, erythema of the lips and oral mucosa, changes in the extremities, rash, and
      cervical lymphadenopathy. Incidence of late coronary artery aneurysms or ectasia, which may
      lead to myocardial infarction (MI), sudden death, or ischemic heart disease, decreased after
      the introduction of intravenous immunoglobulin therapy. However, significant persistent
      coronary arterial lesions or aneurysms may still occur in about 1-3 % of the patients.

      Atorvastatin (Lipitor®), a kind of statin, is a selective competitive inhibitor of
      3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. This drug had been safely and
      widely used for treatment of adult hyperlipidemia, prevention of coronary heart disease and
      familial hypercholesterolemia in childhood. In addition to the cholesterol-lowering effects,
      statins exerts diverse cellular, cholesterol-independent effects, including improvement in
      endothelial function, inhibition of neurohormonal activation, and reduction in levels of
      proinflammatory cytokines. Based on the above concepts, some patients with infrarenal
      abdominal aortic aneurysms received statin therapies and then the growth rate of aneurysms
      slowed down.

      Therefore, the investigators may hypothesize that Atorvastatin is helpful in the regression
      of persistent coronary lesions in KD patients due to its effect of anti-inflammation. In
      NTUH, there are about 20 KD patients with coronary lesions persistent for many years. And
      the investigators plan to conduct the clinical trial with atorvastatin to evaluate the
      effects of Atorvastatin on the persistent coronary arterial lesions/aneurysms in children
      with Kawasaki disease including safety and efficacy.

      Methods

      There are around 20 KD patients eligible for this study. After they sign the IRB-approved
      ICF, they will be enrolled for this study. Briefly, this study is divided into three stages:
      screening & enrollment stage (I), treatment & follow-up stage (II) for 1 year and final data
      analysis stage (III). Measurements include basic vital sign, electrocardiography, liver
      function, muscle enzyme, inflammatory markers and echocardiography.

      Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute multi-system vasculitis syndrome of unknown etiology
      occurring mostly in infants and children younger than 5 years of age. In developed
      countries, it is the leading cause of acquired heart disease in children. However, KD
      remains a mysterious disease.

      Single high dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG, 2gm/kg) and aspirin are standard
      treatment for KD. Aspirin have been prescribed in treatment of KD for decade even earlier
      than usage of IVIG. High dose aspirin mainly act as anti-inflammation, while low dose
      aspirin as anti-platelet. IVIG may play most of the role of anti-inflammation in acute stage
      of KD. Hsieh et al. reported that KD without high dose aspirin had the same treatment
      response after IVIG. Therefore it is still unclear about the necessarily of high dose
      aspirin in acute stage of KD.

      It is known that patients who fracture their legs sometimes develop blood clots (known as
      deep vein thrombosis) in their legs. These clots may cause pain and swelling in the leg or
      they may detach and travel to the lungs producing shortness of breath, chest pain, and
      sometimes death. Unfortunately, it is not known how frequently these complications occur
      after leg fractures, or if the use of a blood thinner medication can effectively and safely
      prevent these clots. Doctors at hospitals across Canada are conducting a study in which
      patients who have surgery for leg fractures receive either a once-daily injection of a blood
      thinner, known as low molecular weight heparin, or a placebo injection for up to 14 days
      after their fractures. Neither the patients nor the doctors know which patient is on the
      medication and which patient is on placebo. All patients receive an ultrasound examination
      of their legs at 2 weeks after surgery to monitor for deep vein thrombosis. In addition, all
      patients are checked for symptoms of leg or lung clots and any side effects of the
      medication for 3 months. If the blood thinner is shown to be effective at reducing this
      complication and documented to be safe and cost-effective in this setting it will be
      recommended for use in such patients. If, on the other hand, the frequency of deep vein
      thrombosis is too low to justify the cost or inconvenience of taking this medication, this
      will also be an important finding.

NCT00225108,The STOP CLOT Pilot Study: Study of Low Molecular Weight Heparin in High Risk Cesarean Section,"
      Venous thromboembolism (VTE) remains the most common cause of maternal death in the
      developed world. VTE includes two conditions, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary
      embolism (PE). DVT refers to a blood clot that has formed in a deep vein, often in the legs
      and/or pelvis and PE refers to the passage of these clots into the lungs (which can be
      fatal). VTE is up to 10 times more common in pregnant women than non-pregnant women of
      comparable age. More than a third of pregnancy related VTE occur during the 6 weeks after
      delivery. When compared with vaginal delivery, cesarean delivery further increases the risk
      of pregnancy associated VTE by three-fold.

      A medication called low molecular weight heparin is sometimes prescribed during pregnancy
      and after delivery to prevent VTE. However, clinical practice varies because there hasn’t
      been adequate research to determine that this medication is safe and effective at preventing
      VTE during this time. The potential benefits of the medication must also be weighed against
      its cost and possible side effects.

      The researchers are conducting a study that will assess the effectiveness and safety of low
      molecular weight heparin in women who are at moderate to high risk of VTE after a cesarean
      section. They will monitor these women to determine if those who received the medication
      have fewer blood clots. Participants will also be monitored closely for any side effects.

NCT00643370,Quantifying Lung Tumor Movement Under Deep Inspiration Breath Holds,"
      Radiotherapy is a common treatment for lung cancer. One Challenge of delivering radiation
      treatment to lung tumors accurately is tumor movement which occurs as a patient breathes. In
      some situations, tumors move enough during breathing so that some or all of the tumor may be
      missed by a radiation treatment. One way to decrease the amount a lung tumor moves during
      radiotherapy treatments is for patients to held their breath briefly during a radiation
      treatment. By doing this, a patient's lung tumor may not move as much as it would during
      regular breathing. In this study, the investigators aim to study patients with lung cancers
      which move during breathing. Patients will be asked to hold their breath after inspiration
      while a CT scan of their lung tumor is obtained. The purpose of this study is to study how

NCT00740883,"Extended Duration of Oral Anticoagulant Therapy After a First Episode of Idiopathic Pulmonary Embolism: a Randomized Controlled Trial. ""PADIS-PE"" Study.","
      Rational: After 3 or 6 months of oral anticoagulation for an episode of acute venous
      thromboembolism (VTE), the risk of recurrent VTE is high (10 to 15% per year) in comparison
      with a low risk of recurrence if VTE was provoked by a major transient risk factor such as
      recent surgery (3% per year) independently of the initial presentation (deep vein thrombosis
      or pulmonary embolism). After a first episode of idiopathic VTE, 3 months of anticoagulation
      is associated with a very high risk of recurrence (27% per year); however, the benefit-risk
      of extended duration of anticoagulation (1 to 2 years) remains uncertain, mainly in relation
      with an increased risk of anticoagulant related bleeding. Therefore, the last ACCP
      conference group recommended 6 months of oral anticoagulant therapy after a first episode of
      idiopathic VTE. However, this recommendation is likely to be inadequate for at least two
      main reasons: (1) no studies compared 2 years to 6 months of anticoagulation after
      idiopathic VTE; and (2), if the frequency of recurrent VTE is similar after deep vein
      thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, however, the case fatality rate of recurrent VTE is
      higher after pulmonary embolism (12%) than after deep vein thrombosis (5%).

      Objective : the main objective is to demonstrate that, after 6 months of oral
      anticoagulation for a first episode of idiopathic pulmonary embolism, 18 months of warfarin
      therapy is associated with a lower cumulative risk of recurrent VTE and major bleeding in
      comparison with that on 18 months of placebo. The secondary objectives are: (1) to determine
      the risk of recurrent VTE after 6 months of warfarin therapy and the presence or the absence
      of residual lung scan perfusion defect and the persistence or not of elevated D-dimer test;
      and (2), to determine the impact of extended duration of anticoagulation on the risk of VTE
      after stopping anticoagulant therapy on a follow-up of 2 years.

      Method : French multicenter double blind randomized controlled trial. Inclusion and
      exclusion criteria and pulmonary diagnostic criteria have been defined. After completing 6
      months of oral anticoagulation, a lung scan and D-dimer testing are performed; the
      investigators and the patients will be unaware of the results of these tests. Then, patients
      are randomized to receive 18 months of warfarin therapy or 18 months of placebo (the dose of
      placebo will be adapted according to false computer generated INR). The investigators, the
      radiologists and the patients are blinded of the treatment allocation. The project will be
      submitted to national ethical committee and written consent will be obtained from all
      included patients.

      Required number of patients: the expected cumulative frequency of recurrent VTE and major
      bleeding over 18 months is 4.5% while on warfarin therapy and 16% while on placebo. For a α
      risk of 5% (to falsely conclude to a true difference) and a β risk of 10% (to falsely
      conclude to an absence of difference), 178 patients per group should be included. As 5% of
      patients are expected to be loss, a total of 374 patients is required.

      Feasibility: about 50 patients per year are hospitalized in our department of medicine in
      Brest for an acute episode of idiopathic pulmonary embolism. Four additional centers will
      participate to the study and have a similar recruitment: HEGP (Pr Meyer, Dr Sanchez), CHU
      Antoine Béclère (Dr Parent, Pr Simmoneau), CHU Saint Etienne (Pr Mismetti, Pr Décousus), CHU
      Grenoble (Pr Pison, Pr Carpentier). The study will be coordinated by the Clinical Center of
      Investigation of Brest Hospital; ""true"" and ""false"" INR will be generated by the clinic of
      anticoagulant of ""Ile de France"" (Dr Cambus).

      Clinical implications: the first consequence of the study is to demonstrate that 6 months of
      warfarin therapy is inadequate and should be continued for at least 18 additional months
      after a first episode of idiopathic pulmonary embolism. This study has also the potential to
      confirm or not the contribution of lung scan and D-dimer testing to appreciate the risk of
      recurrent VTE after stopping anticoagulant therapy. Lastly, the medical economical impact of
      such therapeutic management will be evaluated.

NCT00878475,Dyspnea and Biomarkers in a Prehospital Setting,"
      In patients presenting with acute dyspnea in a pre-hospital setting, the early and correct
      diagnosis may present a significant clinical challenge. Physical examination, chest
      radiography, electrocardiography, and standard biological tests often fail to accurately
      differentiate heart failure (HF) from pulmonary causes of dyspnea. Timely differentiation of
      HF from other causes of dyspnea may permit the early institution of appropriate medical
      therapy. Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and amino-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide
      (NT-proBNP) have been proposed as early markers of HF and demonstrated to be useful for
      diagnosing and excluding HF in the emergency department. A combination of BNP or NT-proBNP
      testing and standard clinical assessment has been suggested to be superior to either tool
      used in isolation. Some previous studies have also suggested that quantitative capnometry
      (QC) may be useful in differentiating between cardiac and obstructive causes of respiratory
      distress. Therefore, the investigators hypothesized that a new combination of NT-proBNP
      testing, standard clinical assessment, and partial pressure of end-tidal CO2 (PetCO2) would
      optimize evaluation and differentiation of acute dyspnea in a pre-hospital setting.

      The aim of this study was to determine the accuracy of combination of QC, NT-proBNP, and
      clinical assessment in differentiating acute HF from obstructive pulmonary disease
      (COPD/asthma) as a cause of acute dyspnea in pre-hospital emergency setting.

NCT01230931,Hemostasis in Kocher-Langenbeck Approaches for Acetabular Surgery Using a Topical Surgical Hemostat (Vitagel),"
      Fractures of the acetabulum are considered rare in the general community, but are quite
      common in major metropolitan areas and tertiary care centers. These fractures are some of
      the most complex and challenging injuries to successfully treat in the orthopaedic field.
      Extensile surgical exposures are required to access this unique structure that comprises the
      cup of the hip joint. Large skin incisions, significant soft tissue dissection, and
      elevation of periosteum and muscle from the intact and fractured fragments are often
      required for anatomic reductions of the acetabulum and good outcomes. Thus, there are many
      sources of intra-operative bleeding that can sum up to require strategies aimed at
      preventing bleeding or replacing blood loss.

      Cell-saver and transfusion of allogeneic blood products can replenish blood loss. The use of
      cell-saver is a good solution, but it is quite expensive. Trained perfusionists are required
      and cost over $400 per hour. Disposable products are also required for each patient. While
      blood loss can be great, often not enough blood is captured, processed, and available for
      return transfusion. Allogeneic blood transfusion is often routine. Appropriate blood is
      often on short supply. The cost of processing, testing, and transfusion is also high:
      minimum of $260 per standard unit of packed red blood cells. While risks of disease
      transmission are rare, they exist and can have serious consequences to patients.
      Transmission can include CMV (common), Hepatitis C (1:1,600,000), HIV (1:1,800,000), and
      bacteria (1:500,000). Transfusion reactions are more common and include febrile reactions
      (1:100), allergic reactions (1:100), hemolytic reactions (less common), and
      transfusion-related acute lung injury (1:5000).

      Decreased operative times, aggressive electrocautery, ligation of identifiable vessels,
      minimal soft tissue dissection or stripping, topical agents such as gel foams, and thrombins
      are possible and available. But still, significant blood losses persist. Over the past
      decade, platelet gel products and fibrin sealants have been developed and provide another
      possible solution. There are some retrospective studies in the arthroplasty literature
      indicating these are good hemostatic agents. There is also some literature from the general,
      oral and maxillofacial, and spine surgical fields indicated these topical agents decrease
      intra-operative blood loss. But there are no large prospective, randomized studies in
      orthopedics, particularly traumatology, supporting the use of surgical hemostats.

      This study protocol will use one surgical hemostat (Vitagel, Stryker). The study is a
      prospective, randomized controlled trial to evaluate this type of topical agent's role as a
      hemostatic agent in certain acetabular fracture types that require a non-extensile,
      posterior approach. Three fellowship-trained traumatologists will be involved: Drs. Milan

      assist in analyzing the data and statistical outcomes.

      Purpose of Project. The purpose of our study is to determine whether surgical hemostats can
      minimize blood loss, need for allogeneic blood transfusions and their associated risks, and
      costs in patients with certain acetabular fractures requiring operative fixation via a
      non-extensile Kocher-Langenbeck surgical approach. Since surgical hemostats and other
      topical agents like platelet gel products have also been linked with improved wound healing,
      a secondary endpoint will be incidence of wound dehiscence and/or infections.

      The investigators primary hypothesis is the topical hemostat will result in lower blood
      losses intraoperatively and fewer units of perioperative blood product transfused.

NCT01240044,Respiratory Therapy and Newborn Pain: Comparison Between Techniques,"
      This study intend to assess the pain intensity of newborns in neonatal intensive care unit
      (NICU) undergoing different techniques of respiratory therapy and compare these procedures.
      A randomized controlled clinical trial and blind trial with newborns admitted to NICU. The
      babies were categorized according to gestational age , age, weight, diagnosis, support and
      signs of respiratory distress. Then, they were allocated by lot to come from one of 3
      groups: G1 - control, G2 - undergoing physical therapy; G3 - received the thoracoabdominal
      rebalancing. Each newborn received just one physical therapy session in that they were
      assessed before one of the three procedures (T1), immediately after (T2) and after 15
      minutes (T3). This evaluation found cardiorespiratory parameters (oxygen saturation, heart
      and respiratory rate) and three specific scales for pain assessment (NIPS, NFCS and PIPP).
      The hypothesis is that newborns hospitalized in intensive care unit did not show pain when
      undergoing respiratory therapy.

NCT01242150,Noninvasive Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (NCPAP) in Children,"
      In critically ill pediatric patients with Acute Respiratory Failure (ARF), Noninvasive
      Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (NCPAP) is applied to avoid intubation and all related
      complications such as tracheal injury and predisposition to nosocomial pulmonary infections.
      The choice of the interface is one of the crucial issues affecting treatment outcome in
      pediatric age and in particular in preschool children in whom intolerance frequently
      compromise noninvasive respiratory treatment. NCPAP is applied either through nasal or
      facial tight fitting masks and the most important principle in guiding the selection of an
      interface is that it should fit comfortably. However, while nasal mask can leak gas when the
      infant opens his/her mouth, facial mask can cause significant gastric distension and
      vomiting, with risk of aspirating gastric contents. Moreover, complications such as air
      leaks, skin irritation on the bridge of the nose, and discomfort reported with nasal or
      facial masks in children frequently lead to interruption of the respiratory treatment. Thus,
      improving the interface between the patient and the ventilator would be expected to
      facilitate longer and more effective application of NCPAP.

      A new small helmet specifically designed for young infants has been recently introduced to
      administer NCPAP. In a recent short term crossover physiological randomized controlled
      trial, the investigators found that NCPAP by helmet was associated with enhanced
      feasibility, less need of sedation and prolonged application time (see references below).
      The purpose of this prospective randomized multicenter study is to compare the efficacy and
      feasibility of NCPAP delivered either by helmet or by facial mask to treat acute respiratory
      failure in infants admitted to Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU).

NCT01308385,Prediction and Characterization of Acute and Chronic Postoperative Pain,"
      Despite enormous progress insufficient postoperative pain management remains a frequent
      problem in the early postoperative phase after surgery. Furthermore, the pain that persists
      after healing of the surgical wound is a large, but often unrecognized, clinical problem and
      it is estimated that 5-10% of those undergoing surgery will develop severe persistent pain
      leading to chronic disability and psychosocial distress.

      Conditioned Pain Modulation (CPM), also known as the phenomenon ""pain-inhibits-pain"", is a
      reduction in pain somewhere on the body in response to the application of a second painful
      stimulus outside the painful area. In recent years, the CPM has been identified as a
      psycho-physical measure with clinical relevance in characterizing the individual's ability
      to modulate pain and consequently the individual's disposition to acquire painful
      conditions.

      The purpose of this study is primarily to assess the relationship between CPM efficacy and
      clinical postoperative pain (postoperative pain intensity, use of analgesics, the intensity
      of secondary hyperalgesia and allodynia, and the incidence of persistent postoperative pain)
      associated with minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum. In addition, the study aims
      at identifying other patient- and/or surgery-related factors affecting the course of
      postoperative pain.

      Hypothesis:

      - The greater the positive difference between the experimental pressure pain threshold (kPa)
      measured before and after application of a second painful stimulus (Cold Pressor Test), the
      lower the risk of developing persistent postoperative pain.

      Secondary hypotheses

        -  The greater the positive difference between the experimental pressure pain threshold
           (kPa) measured before and after application of a different experimental painful
           stimulus (Cold Pressor Test) lower the pain intensity in the early postoperative
           period.

        -  The greater the positive difference between the experimental pressure pain threshold
           (kPa) measured before and after application of a different experimental painful
           stimulus (Cold Pressor Test), the shorter duration of early postoperative pain.

        -  The greater the positive difference between the experimental pressure pain threshold
           (kPa) measured before and after application of a different experimental painful
           stimulus (Cold Pressor Test), the lower the usage of epidural analgesia (mg / ml).

        -  The larger the positive difference between the experimental pressure pain threshold
           (kPa) measured before and after application of a different experimental painful
           stimulus (Cold Pressor Test) the lower consumption of oral analgesics (mg / day).

        -  Severe acute pain in the early postoperative period (postoperative days 0-3) is
           positively associated with the development of persistent postoperative pain (6 months
           postoperatively).

        -  Presence of preoperative pain and / or high postoperative use of analgesics and / or
           high pain intensity during the first 6-8 weeks postoperatively predicts pain 6 months
           postoperatively.

        -  The higher pain intensity and discomfort associated with brush-evoked allodynia and /
           or pinprick (Von Frey) secondary hyperalgesia the greater the risk for developing
           persistent postoperative pain (6 months postoperatively).

        -  High levels of preoperative catastrophizing (assessed on the day of admission) is
           related to the severity of acute pain (rated third postoperative day) and chronic pain
           (assessed 6 months postoperatively), even if controlled for depression and anxiety.

        -  The degree of preoperative positive and negative emotions (as assessed on the day of
           admission) is related to the degree of acute pain (rated third postoperative day) and
           chronic pain (assessed 6 months postoperatively) so that negative emotions are
           associated with high levels of pain, while positive feelings are related to low levels
           of pain.

        -  The study population does not differ significantly from the normal population in terms
           of personality traits (emotional reactions, extraversion, openness to experience,
           friendliness, conscientiousness).

        -  The study population does not experience a significant change in personality traits
           during the first 6 months after surgery.

        -  The quality of life and self-esteem is lower among patients who develop persistent
           postoperative pain compared with pain patients.

        -  Quality of life and self-esteem improve as a result of minimally invasive repair of
           pectus excavatum.

NCT01312077,The Analgesic Efficacy of Periarticular Infiltration of Local Anaesthetic for Total Hip Replacement,"
      Total hip replacement is a major surgical procedure usually associated with significant pain
      in the early postoperative period. In our hospital, total hip replacement is routinely
      performed under spinal anaesthesia with intrathecal bupivacaine local anaesthetic plus
      opioid in the form of preservative free morphine. The use of 'local infiltration analgesia'
      as an alternative postoperative analgesic technique has been investigated.In this technique
      the surgeon infiltrates the surgical site with a long-acting local anaesthetic and places a
      catheter under direct vision which remains in situ and is used to administer local
      anaesthetic in the postoperative period until such time as it is removed (when no longer
      deemed necessary for pain relief or at a pre-set time in the postoperative period e.g. 48
      hours). We hypothesize that infiltration of the surgical site with peri- and intraarticular
      levobupivacaine local anaesthetic would be an efficacious pain management technique and
      would not be inferior to intrathecal morphine for postoperative pain management.

      Patients with suspected Pulmonary Embolism (PE) and a high clinical probability or a high

      Tomography Angiography (MCTPA). Unfortunately MCTPA involves radiation exposure, is
      expensive, is not feasible in unstable patients and has contraindications. UltraSound (US)
      is safe and rapidly available even in unstable patients. Many authors evaluated the

      suspicion of PE and with a simplified Well's score>4 (PE likely) or with a D-dimer value
      ≥500ng/ml were enrolled in the study. MCTPA was considered the gold standard for PE
      diagnosis. A multiorgan US was performed by an emergency physician sonographer before MCTPA.
      PE was considered echographically present if CUS was positive for DVT or TTE was positive
      for RVD or at least one pulmonary subpleural infarct was detected with TUS. The accuracy of
      the single and multiorgan US was calculated.

NCT02230865,Prediction of Acute Postoperative Pain and Analgesic Consumption,"
      Pain is an expected part of surgical recovery but effective pain management remains
      challenging. The high variability in postoperative pain experience and analgesic treatment
      response between patients is part of the challenge. Few studies have yet combined
      preoperative assessment of responses to experimental pain with measurements of cognitive and
      emotional processes in the prediction of postoperative pain.

      We hypothesize, that preoperative evoked brain potentials (using standard
      electroencephalographic brain imaging), endogenous pain inhibition capacity (conditioned
      pain modulation), responses to pressure/thermal pain stimulation, and/or situational
      pain-related catastrophic thinking are useful clinical predictors of postoperative pain and
      analgesic consumption.

NCT02334007,Thoracic Surgery Extended Low-Molecular Weight Heparin VTE Prophylaxis--Pilot Trial,"
      After any surgery, there is a risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), including Deep Vein
      Thrombosis (DVT) in the major veins of the legs and Pulmonary Embolus (PE) in the lungs.
      These clots are usually prevented by the administration of low-molecular-weight heparin, a
      blood thinner that prevents clotting. In most surgical specialties like thoracic or vascular
      surgery, this treatment is used until patients are discharged from the hospital. However, in
      orthopaedic surgery, there is strong evidence that longer term preventative treatment up to
      35 days after hospital discharge helps to reduce VTE occurrences. In thoracic surgery, there
      is an even greater risk of developing PE because of the surgical stress, the common presence
      of cancer and direct damage to blood vessels in the lung during surgery. Despite the
      potential utility, the use of extended VTE prevention has never been evaluated in the
      thoracic surgery population. If extended treatment prevents clots, more patients will avoid
      complications related to VTE. There is currently very limited information available on the
      incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients undergoing lung cancer resection and
      the utility of extended thromboprophylaxis (ET) in this patient population. Furthermore, in
      contrast to patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery where ET has become standard of care,
      duration of thromboprophylaxis is not well defined in this patient population. Therefore,
      there is a clear need to systematically evaluate the effects of extended VTE prophylaxis on
      the incidence of VTE in the post-op population.

NCT02375919,PERC Rule to Exclude Pulmonary Embolism in the Emergency Deparment,"
      The Pulmonary Embolism Rule Out Criteria (PERC) is an 8-item rule, that was derived and
      tested to rule out the diagnosis of Pulmonary Embolism (PE) in the Emergency Department (ED)
      amongst low risk patients. Even though meta analyses have confirmed the safety of its
      utilization, equipoise remains - especially in European country where the prevalence of PE
      is higher than in the US- on whether this rule could be safely applied to all low risk
      emergency patients with a suspicion of PE.

      The PROPER Trial is a non inferiority , cluster randomized trial. All centers will recruit
      patients with a suspicion of PE and a low pre test probability. To rule out the diagnosis of
      PE, center will use the usual diagnostic strategies with D-dimeres measurement for 6 months,
      and PERC based strategy for 6 months.

      In the control group (usual strategy), patients will be tested for D-dimeres, followed if
      positive by a Computed Tomography of Pulmonary Artery (CTPA).

      In the intervention group (PERC Based), patients will be first assessed with PERC score. If
      PERC=0, then the diagnosis of PE will be exclude with no supplemental investigations. If
      PERC>0, then patients will undergo the usual strategy, with D-dimeres measurement +/- CTPA.

      The primary outcome is the failure percentage of the diagnostic strategy, defined as

NCT02386696,Pleural Sliding During Valsalva and Muller Maneuvers,"
      Recently, ultrasound artifacts mimicking lung sliding have been described in absence of the
      visceral pleura, in a group of patients who underwent pneumonectomy. In these patients, lung
      sliding was clearly absent during mechanical ventilation in the operated hemithorax. During
      spontaneous breathing, although of lower intensity compared to the unoperated hemithorax,
      some artifacts mimicking lung sliding and seashore sign were found during each deep
      spontaneous breath. These findings have led to the hypothesis that these artifacts may be
      due to the contraction of the intercostal muscles.

      The objective of the present study is to reproduce such artifacts during contraction of the
      inspiratory and expiratory muscles with closed glottis (Valsalva and Muller maneuvers): in
      this condition each subject is not ventilating and the two pleural layers are not sliding

NCT02402881,Education Bundle to Decrease Patient Refusal of VTE Prophylaxis,"
      The investigators have recently developed a registry of missed doses of VTE prophylaxis that

      prophylaxis refusal, the group has developed a patient-centered education bundle that will
      be delivered as an in-person, 1-on-1 discussion session with a nurse educator. Supporting
      education materials include a 2-page education sheet and an educational video.

      The investigators hypothesize that patient refusal of VTE prophylaxis is associated with
      significant knowledge gaps among patients regarding their risk of developing VTE and the
      benefits of VTE prophylaxis and that delivering an education bundle to patients that refuse
      VTE prophylaxis will improve compliance with VTE prophylaxis and decrease rates of VTE.

NCT02437942,"Anatomical, Radiological and Biomechanical Examination of Athletic Groin Pain Patients and Physical Therapy Intervention","
      Athletic groin pain (AGP) is a chronic condition common in multi-directional sports (Walden
      et al. 2007, Robinson et al. 2004, Murphy et al. 2012). It is a complex injury with a
      challenging diagnosis. Dramatic differences in the anatomical diagnoses of AGP cohorts exist
      in the literature (Renstrom et al. 1980, Lovell et al. 1995, Holmich et al. 2007, Bradshaw
      et al. 2008). This may be due to the complexity of the anatomy in the region and the absence
      of magnetic resonance imaging (MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGE) to confirm clinical examination.

      Dynamic actions undertaken in field sports (including change of direction cutting) are
      particularly associated with the development of athletic groin pain (Holmich et al. 2014).
      Dynamic multi-plane, multi-joint actions can overload musculoskeletal and fascial structures
      in the hip and groin. Despite this, traditional groin pain assessments do not involve an
      examination of sport specific actions. An examination of jumping, hopping and cutting
      mechanics, which is possible with the use of three dimensional motion capture techniques,
      will provide additional information with which to diagnosis and rehabilitate athletes.

      While the majority of published studies on AGP have focused on surgical management (Serner
      et al. 2015), exercise therapy has been found to be an effective treatment (Holmich et al.
      1995). In exercise therapy studies the best results were shown by Holmich et al (1995) where
      subjects suffered for an average of 9.9 months with symptoms and a strength and stability
      program focused on adductor strength returned them to sport in 18.5 weeks. The latest paper
      on rehabilitation by Jardi et al. demonstrates little improvement with a mean time to return
      to training of 86 days +/-15. The focus remains on improving strength of isolated muscle
      groups and not attempting to address underlying biomechanical abnormalities that may be
      leading to overload. Accurate biomechanical assessment and individualized rehabilitation
      based on the high speed multiplanar movements that drive the athlete's symptoms may enhance
      the efficiency of rehabilitation. Moreover post-rehabilitation changes in biomechanical
      factors may provide a further insight into the biomechanical factors associated with AGP.

      The purpose of this study was to:

        1. Describe clinical presentation (physical examination and magnetic resonance imaging
           findings) for a group of athletes presenting with AGP

        2. To describe the different biomechanical diagnoses that exist in AGP patients

        3. To examine the effects of a biomechanics led exercise intervention to rehabilitate
           chronic groin pain

      It is hypothesised that standardised magnetic resonance imaging will aid in the anatomical
      diagnosis of athletic groin pain patients. From a biomechanics perspective, distinct
      subgroups/clusters will exist that differ from each other in how they undertake dynamic
      sport specific actions. These distinct clusters will describe potential biomechanical
      diagnoses that exist in groin pain patients. A biomechanics led rehabilitation program will
      return groin pain patients back to sport more quickly than previous rehabilitation programs
      without biomechanical diagnostic information.

      Brief protocol Participants will be recruited from patients with chronic athletic groin pain
      who present for investigation and rehabilitation at Sports Surgery Clinic, Ireland. A
      standardised clinical examination will be undertaken including range of motion assessment,
      pain provocation and load tolerance tests, and palpation.

      A Magnetic Resonance Image of the hip and groin region will then be undertaken and read by a
      consultant sports physician.

      Biomechanical assessment will include capturing of jumping, hopping and cutting mechanics
      through the use of three dimensional motion capture technology and force plates. Here
      reflective markers are placed on the skin at anatomical landmarks. These markers are picked
      up by the cameras and tracked at 200 frames per second. Participants will contact the force
      plate with their foot on undertaking the movements. Force and marker data will be combined
      to calculate joint angles and moments.

      Physical therapy assessment will include an assessment of functional movement, range of
      motion testing, adductor squeeze tests, strength assessment of hip and trunk.
      Physiotherapists will utilise three dimensional biomechanical data during cutting and
      landing to inform individualised rehabilitation. Rehabilitation will consist of movement
      control, whole body strength and power, linear running mechanics, multi-directional
      mechanics and conditioning sessions. Participants will have follow up physical therapy
      appointments approximately every two weeks. A hip and groin outcome score (HAGOS) will be
      used to monitor the morbidity and severity of the injury throughout the rehabilitation
      process.

      Once the physiotherapist determines that the patient is ready to return to play a
      biomechanical re-test will be undertaken.

      The clinical presentation of acute pulmonary embolism ranges from mild dyspnea and cough to
      shock or sustained hypotension but it also may even be asymptomatic and diagnosed by imaging
      procedures performed for other purposes. (1) Depending on the clinical presentation, the
      case fatality rate for acute pulmonary embolism ranges from 1% up to 60%. Due to the often
      non-specific presentation, especially in mild to moderate acute pulmonary embolism PE is
      often underdiagnosed. Chest pain and shortness of breath are the two most common symptoms
      associated with pulmonary embolism, together these symptoms are responsible for
      approximately 10 million emergency department visits in the United States of America (US)
      (2). The aim of this study was to determine the sensitivity and specificity of diagnosing
      pulmonary embolism (PE) at the emergency department (ED) of the University Hospital Basel
      and the investigators have therefore retrospectively analyzed all cases with excluded or
      proven PE in our institution in the last three years. Data sets from the institute of
      radiology, the institute of pathology and the ED are consistently available from January
      2011 until the present day and were screened for pulmonary embolism in discharge reports.
      Data from the ED include all patients between January 2011 and December 2013 that presented
      to the ED and received either an ECG or any form of thoracic imaging. Particular attention
      was paid to patients with PE in the discharge report. The third set of data includes all
      patients with PE as cause of death or as a secondary diagnosis in the autopsy report. After
      comparing the three sets of data to each other the investigators tried to determine the
      sensitivity and specificity of PE diagnosis at the ED respectively the rate of missed
      diagnoses. A PE was seen as missed if it is detected 24h after the patient presented to the

      The fractures of distal forearm are the most common trauma in children. Sometimes one of the

      The common opinion is expressed in one of the textbooks and is represented by one sentence,
      which usually one bone shortening is well tolerated, probably does not cause a problem, and
      does not have clinical significance. However, pathology of ulna plus or minus variants is

      We postulate that obvious shortening of one bone may cause an inequality of DRUJ and can be
      clinically significant.

NCT00586365,Naproxen for the Prevention of HO After Complex Elbow Trauma,"
      Complex elbow fractures can lead to formation of new bone (called Heterotopic ossification).
      This new bone is unwanted and it can restrict motion. This research study is being done to
      learn more about the effect of the drug naproxen, on unwanted formation of new bone around
      the elbow as it heals after a fracture. Naproxen belongs to a class of drugs called NSAIDs
      which stands for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

      Several research studies suggest that NSAIDs such as Naproxen can prevent the unwanted
      formation of new bone around the hip. The effect of NSAIDS on the formation of bone around
      the elbow has not been studied as well as it has been studied for their effect on the hip.

      The drug, Naproxen is approved by the US food and drug administration (FDA) for sale but ot

NCT01038219,Reliability of Subjective Assessment of Fever by Parents and Health Care Providers in Children and Adolescents,"
      Background: Fever is a widespread symptom in many diseases. Therefore, its value and
      diagnostic importance are well known. Fever in children is one of the common reasons for a
      visit to the pediatrician. Also, taking temperature is a very simple action and accessible
      to the general public.

      Temperature is measured in various parts of the body by using medical equipment. The type of
      method and thermometer varies according to the patient's age but often temperature is
      estimated by touch. Temperature measurement serves as a means for monitoring the patient's
      condition. For that reason, supervision of the body temperature is an important factor in
      the process of taking medical decisions.

      Study rationale: the parent is often asked if the child's temperature has been taken. The
      most frequent answer is: ""I didn't measure, but I felt that he has a temperature"". The few
      studies carried out on this subject showed that many parents used touch to evaluate the
      child's body temperature, especially in infants.

      Some studies checked the reliability of parents to estimate the child's body temperature by
      touch only. To the best of our knowledge, the reliability of medical staff (nurses) to
      estimate the child's body temperature by touch has never been studied.

      The aim of the current study is to investigate whether parents and nurses correctly estimate
      the child's body temperature by touch, as compared to thermometer measurement during the
      pediatric unit's routine work.

NCT01143558,Searching for Persistence of Infection in Lyme Disease,"
      Background:

      Lyme disease is an infection caused by Borrelia burgdorferi, a bacteria that is transmitted
      to humans by ticks. It can cause many different symptoms including rash, fever, headache,
      meningitis (infection of the central nervous system), and arthritis. While most patients
      improve after taking antibiotics, some patients continue to have symptoms. It is currently
      unknown why some patients continue to have symptoms. One possibility is that the antibiotics
      have not successfully gotten rid of all of the bacteria. Current tests for Lyme disease
      cannot tell whether the bacteria have been successfully eliminated from the body.

      Xenodiagnosis is a way to look for Borrelia bacteria using the animal that usually hosts
      them, Ixodes scapularis (also known as the deer tick). This method takes advantage of the
      evolution of the bacteria and the insect that transmits the infection, which can make the
      insect particularly good at finding the agent. In studies of animals, xenodiagnosis may be
      more sensitive than current tests for detecting the presence of the Lyme disease bacteria.
      Researchers are interested in using xenodiagnosis to determine whether uninfected ticks that
      feed on humans who have been infected with Lyme disease bacteria can detect the continued
      presence of live bacteria.

      Objectives:

      - To determine whether xenodiagnosis can be used to successfully investigate the presence of
      Lyme disease bacteria.

      Eligibility:

        1. Individuals at least 18 years of age who are in one of the following categories:

        2. Have had the erythema migrans rash (a symptom of Lyme infection) and received
           antibiotic therapy less than 4 months ago (but have not had antibiotics in the previous
           month).

        3. Have the erythema migrans rash and received less than 2 days of antibiotic therapy.

        4. Have been diagnosed with early or late Lyme disease, have received antibiotic therapy,
           but still have high levels of antibodies against the bacteria at least 6 months after
           therapy, and have not received antibiotics in the past 3 months.

        5. Have been diagnosed with early or late Lyme disease, have received antibiotic therapy,
           and have new complaints of fatigue or other symptoms that are persistent for at least 6
           months after completion of antibiotic therapy, and have not received antibiotics in the
           past 3 months.

        6. Have been diagnosed with Lyme arthritis and have not yet received antibiotic therapy.

        7. Healthy volunteers who have not had Lyme disease will also be included in this study.

      Design:

        -  Participants will have an initial visit for a physical examination, medical history,
           and blood sample.

        -  For the first study visit, researchers will place a strip of filter paper or a small
           plastic container with 20 to 30 disease-free ticks on the participant s skin. If
           possible, the ticks will be placed at the site of a Lyme disease rash or another
           suspicious area, or on the nondominant forearm. Participants will be asked to keep the
           ticks in place, and will keep a diary card at home to record any symptoms or problems.

        -  The ticks will be collected 4 to 6 days after placement. At that visit, participants
           will have a skin biopsy taken of the area tested, a blood sample will be collected, and
           participants will receive a new diary card to keep until the next clinic visit.

        -  After 1 month, participants will provide a final blood sample, and will receive a
           follow-up phone call 2 months afterward.

NCT01296750,Late Compared to Early Physiotherapy Following Knee Dislocation,"
      A knee dislocation is an unusual and extremely serious injury and is defined as complete
      displacement of the tibia with respect to the femur, usually with disruption of 3 or more of
      the stabilizing ligaments. When the knee dislocates, there is often significant damage to
      the soft-tissues envelope surrounding the joint, including adjacent neurovascular
      structures. Not surprisingly, this injury is a profoundly debilitating, life-altering event,
      with the potential to necessitate career change in athletes and laborers alike. Current
      evidence indicates that operative management for these injuries is more effective at
      returning patients to pre-morbid range of motion (ROM) and activity than conservative
      management. Post operative rehabilitation programs for these patients must balance the need
      for stability of their surgical repair and knee ROM and functionality. Experimental data
      suggests that post-operative immobilization offers greater protection of the surgical
      reconstruction, whereas immediate, aggressive physiotherapy may be more effective at
      preventing arthrofibrosis stiffness. The investigators are proposing a randomized clinical
      trial comparing early physiotherapy (day one post op) versus immobilization for three weeks
      then initiation of physiotherapy. The physiotherapy progams will be identicalbe in all
      aspects except for progam initiation.

NCT01434368,A Longitudinal Investigation of the Endocrine and Neurobiologic Events Accompanying Puberty,"
      Despite the clear importance of adolescence in the emergence of a number of disease states
      and processes, there is surprisingly little known about how the endocrine and metabolic
      events accompanying puberty in humans impact normal developmental neurobiology.
      Epidemiologic studies have identified sexual dimorphisms in the prevalence of several
      neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression, schizophrenia, and substance abuse. Many
      of these sex differences emerge during or shortly after puberty and are maintained until the
      5th-6th decade of life. For example, the two-fold greater risk of unipolar depression in
      women compared with men does not appear until adolescence, and prior to puberty girls are
      not at increased risk relative to boys. Puberty is a structured, transitional process that
      can be influenced by both nutritional factors and environmental stressors; nonetheless, the
      variability in the timing and duration of puberty is largely determined by oligogenic
      inheritance. Basic neuroscience research has demonstrated that hormonal events accompanying
      puberty impact on many of the physiologic systems involved in the regulation of brain
      function (e.g., the appearance of new neurons in a brain-region specific pattern, neuronal
      remodeling, and the pruning of cortical connectivity). Additionally, not only does stress
      during puberty increase the risk of disturbances in affective adaptation during adulthood,
      but the events accompanying puberty modify stress responsivity (e.g., alterations in the
      duration and peak response of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal [HPA] axis hormones to
      stressors). Moreover, animal work has demonstrated that neural connectivity differs in a
      brain regional specific manner according to the stage of puberty (i.e., early versus late).
      In humans, puberty also occurs in stages, and although the endocrinology of puberty,
      surprisingly, has not been fully characterized with longitudinal data, studies have
      documented that the physical changes measured by Tanner stages I to V are accompanied by
      progressive increases in the secretions of both gonadal and adrenal steroids. Nonetheless,
      there remains considerable variability in the timing and duration of this otherwise highly
      structured reproductive transition.

      We propose to perform a longitudinal, naturalistic study examining changes in brain
      structure and function, behavior, and stress responsivity in boys and girls across the
      pubertal transition. Because the pubertal transition is defined by a complex series of
      physiologic events that emerge sequentially over several years and involve changes in
      multiple endocrine and growth systems, and because there is also considerable variability in
      the timing of these events reflecting the influence of both genetic and environmental
      factors, puberty cannot by delineated by age of the participants as has been done in most
      imaging and other neurobiological studies of adolescence. The present study will formally
      bridge this gap by defining pubertal events per se in participants.

      Participants will include healthy boys and girls whose pubertal status will be assessed, and
      in whom endocrine, metabolic, and brain imaging measures will be evaluated at eight - ten
      month intervals from age eight years (pre-puberty) until age 17 years (post-puberty).
      Reproductive endocrine, metabolic, and physical measures will be employed to characterize
      the stage and duration of pubertal development. Outcome measures will be derived via
      multimodal neuroimaging techniques, cognitive/behavioral assessments, metabolic
      measurements, and evaluations of HPA axis function. Additionally, the impact of genetic
      variation on the developmental trajectory of these parameters (both reproductive and CNS)
      will be determined.

      This cross-institute proposal will employ a multidisciplinary approach to evaluating the
      effects on CNS function of the process of puberty in both boys and girls. This work will not
      only serve to inform research on the mechanisms by which sexual dimorphisms in
      neuropsychiatric disorders develop, it will also have important implications for the
      prevention and treatment of these disorders.

      Lateral epicondylitis (LE) is the most common cause of lateral elbow pain. Intratissue
      percutaneous electrolysis (EPI technique) is a novel minimally invasive approach which
      consists in the application of a galvanic current through a puncture needle which produces a
      local inflammatory process in the soft tissue and the reparation of the affected tissue.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical and ultrasonographic effectiveness of
      a multimodal program using the intratissue percutaneous electrolysis technique and exercises
      in the short term for patients with chronic lateral epicondylitis, and to determine whether
      the clinical outcomes achieved decline over time.

      This study is an observational one-way repeated measures design. 36 patients in a clinical
      setting presenting with lateral epicondylitis (mean age = 38, mean time since injury = 12.6
      months) received one session of EPI per week over 4-6 weeks, associated with a home program
      of eccentric exercise and stretching. The main outcome measures were severity of pain (VAS,
      digital algometer, Cozen and Thompson tests), disability (DASH questionnaire), structural
      tendon changes (ultrasound), hypervascularity (power doppler) and patient's perceptions of
      overall outcome (4-point scale). Measurements at 6, 26 and 52 weeks follow-up included
      recurrence rates (increase of severity of pain or disability compared to discharge), the
      perception of overall outcome and success rates. Paired Student t-tests and Chi squared

      shoulder during routine daily activities, the onset of pain or injury lead to increased
      healthcare expenses, limitation in activity, depression, decreased participation, and
      reduced quality of life. One of the main reasons of shoulder pain is believed to have a
      altered scapular movement. To clarify the mechanism of the shoulder pain and injury,
      comprehensive understanding of three-dimensional scapular kinematics is required. Ultrasound
      is a low-cost and non-invasive imaging system and has been used to diagnose the shoulder
      pain and injury in individuals with SCI. A freehand ultrasound (FUS) combining ultrasound
      with motion capture system to evaluate scapular movement was developed and presented
      favorable results in able-bodied population. The purpose of this study is to compare the FUS
      and widely used skin-based method against a radiographic based gold standard in people with
      paraplegia, and to elucidate the relationship among scapular movement and shoulder pain,
      pathology. This study will also allow us to gain more understanding of how level of injury
      influences the scapular behavior during functional activities. The investigators believe
      more severe shoulder pain and pathology will be associated with greater abnormal scapular
      movement. The investigators also believe that people with high-level paraplegia will have
      greater scapular abnormality than people with low-level paraplegia during arm elevation and
      weight relief raise tasks. By completing this study, the investigators will expect to
      deliver a reliable and valid tool to evaluate scapular movement and gain a better
      understanding how the altered scapular movement is related to shoulder pain and pathology.
      The investigators will also learn how the level of injury affects the scapular behavior
      during functional activities. The results of this study may help the shoulder pain
      management leading to the improvement in the quality of life of individuals with SCI.

NCT00241631,Enhancement of in−Vitro GC Function in Patients With COPD,"
      The global burden of COPD − a common and debilitating chronic inflammatory disease that is
      characterised by the progressive development of airflow limitation (shortness of breath −
      SOB) and is poorly reversible with currently available drugs −is increasing. Cigarette
      smoking is strongly linked with the ongoing inflammation; inflammation that can continue
      even when the patient has stopped smoking. The severity of airflow limitation (SOB) is
      correlated with the degree of pulmonary (lung) inflammation.

      Histone deacetylases (HDACs)are important molecules in suppressing this pulmonary
      inflammation. We have recently shown that patients with COPD have a reduction in total HDAC
      which correlates with the severity of their lung disease.

      Corticosteroids (anti−inflammatory treatment) act, at least in part, by recruitment of these
      HDACs to the site of active inflammatory gene transcription (which reduces the production of
      inflammatory molecules) and are widely used in COPD in patients with severe disease.
      Unfortunately, in COPD, inhaled corticosteroids seem to have little effect on the underlying
      inflammation (though in a selective group of patients with COPD they do reduce the number of
      infections a patient may have by a small amount). Theophylline has been used in the
      treatment of asthma and COPD for over 70 years, but its use has recently declined. Data so
      far obtained in primary cells (cells from patients used in the laboratory) from COPD
      patients suggests that low dose theophylline (~5mg/l) should be effective in restoring
      steroid sensitivity in patients with COPD (and hence reduce inflammation thus improving
      SOB). We wish therefore to continue these studies on theophylline principally by conducting
      a small clinical pilot study on 20−30 COPD patients in a randomised, double−blind,
      placebo−controlled, parallel−group study.

      Renal artery stenosis (RAS) usually refers to a disease of the large extra-renal arterial
      vessels and most frequently is caused by atherosclerotic obstructions. The prevalence of
      atherosclerotic RAS increases with age, male gender, traditional cardiovascular risk factors
      (hypertension, diabetes, smoking, hyperlipidemia) and atherosclerotic comorbidities like
      coronary artery or peripheral artery disease (PAD). A prevalence up to 40% has been reported
      in patients with PAD. Undoubtedly, atherosclerotic RAS is a progressive disease, as more
      than half of the patients exhibit an increasing degree of stenosis within five years after
      diagnosis, and one out of five patients with a critical stenosis (>60%) suffers renal
      atrophy and renal failure during this period. RAS may be treated conservatively by so called
      best medical treatment, surgically, or by endovascular interventions using balloon
      angioplasty and stenting.

      The purpose of the investigators study is to determine the incidence and the predictors of

      The goal of this research is to determine noninvasively whether detection of coronary
      stenosis and plaque by multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) in patients with acute chest
      pain suspected of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) enhances triage, reduces cost and is cost
      effective. Among the 5.6 million patients with ACP presenting annually in emergency
      departments (ED) in the United States, a subgroup of two million patients is hospitalized
      despite normal initial cardiac biomarker tests and electrocardiogram (ECG). This subgroup is
      at low (20%) risk for ACS during the index hospitalization. Most (80-94%) patients with a
      diagnosis of ACS have a significant epicardial coronary artery stenosis ( >50% luminal
      narrowing). However, in -10% of patients non-stenotic coronary plaque triggers events, i.e.
      vasospasms, leading to myocardial ischemia. Since the absence of plaque excludes a coronary
      cause of chest pain, these patients could in theory be discharged earlier reducing
      unnecessary hospital admissions. Recent publications demonstrate high sensitivity and
      specificity of MDCT for the detection of significant coronary stenosis compared with
      coronary angiography and the detection of coronary plaque as validated with intravascular
      ultrasound. Using 64- slice MDCT we propose to study 400 patients with ACP, negative initial
      cardiac biomarkers and non-diagnostic ECG. We will analyze MDCT images for the presence of
      significant coronary artery stenosis and plaque and correlate the data with the clinical
      diagnosis of ACS (AHA guidelines) during the index hospitalization to determine the
      sensitivity and specificity. MDCT data, risk factors, and the results of standard diagnostic
      tests available at the time of MDCT will be used to generate a multivariate prediction
      function and derive a clinical decision rule. Based on this decision rule we will compare
      the diagnostic accuracies and cost effectiveness of competing strategies. We hypothesize
      that an MDCT- based diagnostic strategy will reduce the time to diagnosis of ACS, number of
      hospitalizations, and absolute cost of management of patients with acute chest pain compared
      to standard clinical care and is cost effective.

      The incidence of distal radius fracture (DRF) increases with age, and thus, because of
      improving life expectancies, these fractures are set to become more common. Fractures of the
      distal radial metaphysis are known to be strongly related to osteoporosis, and as a result,
      the management of distal radius fractures in elderly patients is beset with difficulties.

      Recently, more aggressive fracture fixation in the elderly has become a topic of interest,
      in the hope of increasing the rate of recovery to preserve the ability to live
      independently. Many elderly patients remain active well into their eighth and ninth decades,
      for example, some pursue activities, such as, golf and tennis, on a daily basis. The
      introduction of volar locking plating system has increased this interest. This system, which
      uses a fixed angle principle, has been proposed to be effective at maintaining good anatomic
      reduction, even in the elderly. However, there is a still concern about remaining
      metaphyseal defect after reduction of the osteoporotic DRF.

      Injectable calcium phosphate bone cement (CPC) has been used to augment the remaining
      metaphyseal defect after fracture reduction including DRF, specially in osteoporotic old
      patients. The purpose of this randomized, prospective study was to investigate that
      additional CPC augmentation has any benefit over volar locking plate fixation in unstable
      DRF patient who is older than 65. The null hypothesis is that there is no difference of
      wrist functional outcomes, radiographic outcomes, and complications between treatment of
      volar locking plate alone and calcium phosphate bone cement as well as volar locking plate
      in unstable DRF patient who is older than 65.

      pressure has not been confirmed directly by simultaneous echocardiographic catheterization.
      The present study, therefore, assessed the correlation between the LA volume and LV filling
      pressure in patients with severe mitral regurgitation (MR). Because the LA pressure
      increases to maintain adequate LV diastolic filling, increased atrial wall tension tends to
      dilate the chamber and stretch the atrial myocardium. Therefore, the lower the ability of
      the left atrium to stretch, the greater the pressure in the left atrium. The study is
      designed to assess 1) the relationship between LV filling pressure and LA distensibility,
      and 2) the power of left atrial distensibility to predict the prognosis, including operation
      mortality, the rate of post-operation atrial fibrillation, and late heart failure event in
      patients with severe mitral regurgitation.

NCT01208714,Medical and Endovascular Treatment of Atherosclerotic Renal Artery Stenosis (METRAS Study),"
      Renal atherosclerotic stenosis (RAS) is a prevalent cause of secondary hypertension (HT).
      Since there are still uncertainties as to whether and in what patients revascularization by
      means of percutaneous renal angioplasty (PTRAS) should be pursued, we designed a study
      exploiting an optimized patient selection strategy and using hard experimental endpoints to
      unravel these uncertainties.

      Primary objective: to determine if revascularization by means of PTRAS is superior or
      equivalent to optimal medical treatment for preserving glomerular filtration rate in the
      ischemic kidney as assessed by 99mTcDTPA sequential renal scintiscan.

      Secondary objectives: to determine if the two treatments are equivalent in lowering blood
      pressure (BP), preserving overall renal function and regressing damage in the target organs
      of hypertension.

      Design: prospective multicenter randomized, unblinded two-arm study.

      Eligible patients will have clinical and/or radiological evidence of unilateral or bilateral
      RAS, defined by stenosis of the proximal portion of the renal artery and its main
      bifurcations at angioCT. Duplex scan will exclude nephroangiosclerosis as the latter could
      bias the assessment of the outcome of revascularization.

      Inclusion criteria. RAS affecting the main renal artery or its major branches at angio-CT
      either > 70% or, if < 70 with post-stenotic dilatation.

      Renal function will be assessed with 99mTc-DTPA renal scintigraphy.

      Sample size (30 patients per arm) was calculated to have a 90% power to detect a difference
      in means of GFR in the vascularized (or control untreated kidney) of 7.5 ml/min.

      Arms

        1. Revascularization: digital scan angiography and PTA with stenting of the renal artery
           at the ostium or at truncular level, plus optimal medical therapy.

        2. Medical therapy: the drug regimen that had been optimized during the run-in period.

      Experimental endpoints:

      The absolute value of GFR assessed by 99TcDTPA in the ischemic kidney will be used as
      quantitative variable and compared between groups at each time point. A categorical
      definition of kidney loss, defined as a GFR in the ischemic kidney of < 5 ml/min, will be
      also used and the rate of achievement of such endpoint will be compared.

NCT01288560,IMAGE-HF Project I-A: Cardiac Imaging in Ischemic Heart Failure (AIMI-HF),"
      Medical imaging is one of the fastest growing sectors in health care and increases in
      utilization underscore the need to ensure imaging technology is developed and used
      effectively. Evaluation of the clinical and economic impact of such imaging lags behind the
      technology development. Heart failure (HF)represents the final common pathway for most forms
      of heart disease and morbidity and mortality remain high. There is a need to identify
      imaging approaches that have a positive impact on therapy decisions, patient outcomes and
      costs. As well as standard methods to evaluate new and emerging techniques to better test
      their potential in a clinical management setting. The OVERALL OBJECTIVES of the IMAGE-HF
      trial are 1) to determine the impact of emerging imaging strategies, on relevant clinical
      outcomes and decision making in patients with HF; 2) to establish standardization quality
      assurance (QA) measures and central databases in order to achieve reliable outcome driven
      research; 3) to apply this as a platform for evaluation of new and emerging imaging
      biomarkers in HF.

      Project I-A: The PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF AIMI-HF is to compare the effect of HF imaging
      strategies on the composite clinical endpoint of cardiac death, MI, resuscitated cardiac
      arrest and cardiac re-hospitalization (WHF, ACS, arrhythmia). Patients with an ischemic
      heart disease (IHD) etiology will follow HF imaging strategy algorithms according to the
      question(s) asked by the physicians (is there ischemia and/or viability), in agreement with
      their local practices for standard and alternative imaging.

      Secondary objectives of AIMI-HF To compare the effect of HF imaging strategies on

        1. The incidence of revascularization procedures (PCI, CABG)

        2. LV remodeling: LV volumes, LVEF

        3. HF symptoms, NYHA class

NCT01369797,Prospective Randomized Study of the Impact on the Autonomy of the Elderly of 75 Years of Age and Older by the UPSAV,"
      Background :

      The evolving concept of frailty was born in the United States under the term of "" frail
      elderly "". It allows describing geriatrics situations, dominated by the weakness or the
      functional instability of aged person, illustrating situations at risk. It is about an
      effective concept, especially in the field of the prevention where it determines strategies
      of specific care. The ageing, changing according to individuals, is characterized by a
      decrease of the physiological reserves leading to a precarious balance and to a
      destabilization.

      Epidemiological studies show a very uneven distribution of three categories of old persons
      according to their health status. Every year, approximately, 12 % of the independent
      population of 75 years of age and older and living at home, lose their autonomy for one of
      the activities of the daily life and turn into frailty.

      Identifying frailty of old subjects is interesting in order to apply preventive and specific
      care strategies to reduce the risks of decompensation. The Global Geriatric Assessment (GGA)
      is the gold standard to detect frailty in this population. The beneficial effects of the GGA
      during the hospitalization have been recognized in international literature.

      The ageing heterogeneousness complexity and the high time-consuming character of GGA led to
      a difficult approach for the nurses or family practioners in taking care of old persons at
      home.

      To balance these difficulties and to optimize prevention of dependence in the elderly, an
      experimental unit of prevention was created : Unit for Prevention, Monitoring and Analysis
      of Aging (UPSAV) on January 4th, 2010 within the geriatric department of the Hospital
      University of Limoges. It is an innovative organizational structure because, for the first
      time, the geriatric expertise is proposed freely to the elderly at home. A multidisciplinary
      gerontological team consisting in a geriatrician, a nurse, a psychomotor therapist and an
      occupational therapist, can, on requiry, move at old persons' home to make a preventive GGA
      to detect the risks of loss of autonomy and to propose a coordination of preventive actions.

      Purpose :

      UPSAV's endpoints are to prevent frail elderly persons from the risk of autonomy loss. This
      action is led in partnership with all the professionals working around old persons.

      The randomized study endpoint is to evaluate elderly from 75 years of age and older at home
      and to select two homogeneous groups: ""reference"" and "" specific intervention "".

      The Compare-Acute trial is a prospective randomised trial in patients with multivessel
      disease, who are admitted into hospital with a ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction. The
      purpose of the study is to compare a FFR guided multivessel PCI taking place during the
      primary PCI with a primary PCI of the culprit vessel only.

      Patients will be enrolled after successful revascularisation of the culprit vessel. Patients
      that have at least one lesion with a diameter of stenosis of more than 50% on visual
      estimation, feasible (operators judgement) for treatment with PCI in a non-infarct related
      artery, will be randomised either to the FFR guided complete revascularisation arm or staged
      revascularisation by proven ischemia or persistence of symptoms of angina.

      Approximately 885 patients will be entered in the study.

      Study hypothesis: FFR-guided complete percutaneous revascularisation of all flow-limiting
      stenoses in the non-IRA performed within the same procedure as the primary PCI or within the
      same hospitalisation will improve clinical outcomes compared to the staged
      revascularisation, guided by prove of ischemia or clinical judgment, as recommended from the

      This study will address the role of percutaneous renal intervention for a hemodynamically

      guidelines suggest evaluation for renal artery stenosis in patients with pulmonary edema or
      heart failure that cannot be attributed to poor left ventricular function. While case series
      have suggested benefit to percutaneous intervention in patients with heart failure, no
      randomized study has addressed the potential benefit of renal stenting for heart failure
      patients. Two large randomized trial of renal stenting for hypertension or poor kidney
      function failed to show benefit in patients with intermediate renal artery lesions. No
      evaluation of the potential hemodynamic significance of the lesions was performed prior to
      randomization. The investigators will enroll patients with heart failure exacerbations not
      attributable to declining left ventricular function, valvular disease, acute coronary
      syndrome, or heart transplant rejection, who on non-invasive imaging appear to have renal
      artery stenosis. After routine invasive assessment, including renal angiography and
      pressure-wire assessment, patients with hemodynamically significant renal artery stenoses
      will be randomized to stent implantation or medical therapy. Patients will then be followed

      there is no objective method to select an appropriate meatus insertion site (MIS) where
      tolerance and epistaxis rate can be improved.

      The investigators hypothesize that that an objective anterior rhinoscopy (to be more

      than the subjective breathing-in method (sniff test) to select the appropriate meatus
      insertion site, thus reducing nasal bleeding and nasal discomfort.

      The optimal method for the prevention of recurrent VT following catheter ablation remains
      unclear. RSDN may be an effective tool for preventing ventricular arrhythmias, and
      associated ICD therapies, by reducing central sympathetic tone, catecholamine levels, and
      the renin-angiotensin- aldosterone system and promoting ventricular remodeling. Although
      RSDN has been shown to reduce the recurrence of VT in a case report of 2 patients suffering

      Despite advances in medical therapy for diabetes, significant numbers of patients fail to
      achieve adequate blood glucose control. Diabetic patients who engage in more self-care
      behaviors have better glycemic control, as measured by HbA1C. Patient ""activation"", defined
      as the knowledge, skills, beliefs, and behaviors to manage a chronic disease, is key to the
      performance of these self-care behaviors.

      There is a growing literature on diabetes behavioral change interventions; however
      interventions are often developed and implemented without consideration of patients
      readiness to engage in lifestyle changes. Additionally, patient-tailored interventions
      require intensive clinical and financial resources, making them difficult to integrate into
      clinical practice. Mobile text messaging (SMS) programs have been successfully used to
      promote smoking cessation, alcohol cessation, and weight loss in diverse patient
      populations. SMS interventions for diabetes have also been developed, but they have been
      designed primarily to provide feedback on blood glucose management, rather than to motivate
      behavioral change. The few studies that included motivational content as a primary feature,
      did not tailor their intervention to a patient's readiness for change or rigorously describe
      their motivational intervention, and show limited efficacy.

      To address these concerns, we will perform a three-month randomized controlled pilot study

NCT02109419,Feasibility and Validity of A Novel Computer Based Battery of Assessments in the Elderly,"
      While standard pencil-and-paper test have continued to be useful for the monitoring of
      cognition, mood, and life space (LS) in the elderly they do have considerable limitations.
      Use of these pencil-and-paper tests requires that individuals come to the clinic for
      assessments, which results in significant clinical costs and practical limitations in the
      conducting of assessments in large numbers of individuals, and provides a time consuming and
      non-automated means of quantifying and recording changes in brain function. It is
      increasingly recognized that there is a need to develop valid and reliable computer based
      assessments to allow for the remote assessment of cognition, mood, and LS. Development of
      computerized based assessments will significantly increase the scale, scope, and speed with
      which cognition, mood, and LS can be measured in the elderly.

      Helping Hands Technology LLC (HHT) has developed a number of web based assessments of
      cognition, mood, and LS. These new computerized assessments will be developed using new
      technology, and are based on the general principles found in existing pencil-and-paper based
      assessments of cognition, mood, and LS. In addition, HHT is developing proprietary means of
      reporting the results of the computerized assessments in an easy to use narrative format.
      This study will focus on quantifying the feasibility and validity of using HHT computerized
      assessments.

      The current guidelines still recommend emergent PCI of the culprit lesion and state that
      primary PCI should be limited to the culprit vessel with the exception of cardiogenic shock
      and persistent ischaemia after PCI of the supposed culprit lesion. This recommendation is
      based on a high number of studies. However, several studies are present about the safety and
      efficacy of non-culprit vessel PCI during acute MI. Nowadays, the debate is increasingly
      going on about the PCI of the non-culprit arteries during the index event with newer
      prospective randomized studies. Besides, it is still unclear for the culprit artery whether
      to treat only the culprit lesion or all the other lesions in the culprit vessel during the

NCT02412176,Right Ventricular Apical Versus True Mid-septal Pacing,"
      Background Right ventricular (RV) artificial apical pacing can negatively impact synchrony
      of left ventricular contraction. The pacing from the septum of the RV can present an
      advantage in terms of less expressed dyssynchrony and reduced negative impact on left
      ventricular (LV) function. However, results of randomized studies comparing apical and
      septal pacing are not uniform. All these results have been affected by improper implantation
      of the septal lead, with many apparently septal leads being, in fact, implanted off-septum.
      The aim of the study is to compare true septal pacing with other RV pacing locations.

      Methods/Design This is a prospective, randomized, single center study. Patients with
      standard indications for cardiac pacing with the expectation of high percentage RV pacing
      will be enrolled. They will be randomized into apical and septal pacing. The real location
      of leads in patients randomized to septal pacing will be confirmed using cardiac CT. After
      cardiac CT, three groups of patients will be created: 1) apical pacing, 2) true septal (in
      which the position of the lead has been verified to be in the septum), and 3) apparent
      septal (in which the position of the lead was found to be off-septum). Primary end-point are
      changes in standard echocardiographic parameters (LV ejection fraction, LV end-systolic
      volume, and LV end-diastolic volume) and the concentration of N-terminal pro brain
      natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) from baseline to 6 months, 1 year and three years. Secondary
      end-points are changes in echo-parameters of LV synchrony.

      Discussion It is hypothesized that correct septal pacing will be associated with reduce
      negative impact on the function of the left ventricle (i.e. smaller decreases in LV EF and
      smaller increases in LVEDV, LVESV) and NT-proBNP, and less expressed LV dyssynchrony.

NCT00001359,Preventive Measures for Childhood-Onset Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder and Tic Disorders (PANDAS Subgroup),"
      A subgroup of patients with childhood-onset obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and/or tic
      disorders has been identified who share a common clinical course characterized by dramatic
      onset and symptom exacerbations following group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GABHS)
      infections. This subgroup is designated by the acronym PANDAS (Pediatric Autoimmune
      Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal infections). There are five
      clinical characteristics that define the PANDAS subgroup: presence of OCD and/or tic
      disorder; prepubertal symptom onset; sudden onset or abrupt exacerbations
      (relapsing-remitting course); association with neurological abnormalities (presence of
      adventitious movements or motoric hyperactivity during exacerbations); and temporal
      association between symptom exacerbations and GABHS infections. In this subgroup, periodic
      exacerbations appear to be triggered by GABHS infections in a manner similar to that of
      Sydenham's chorea, the neurological variant of rheumatic fever.

      Rheumatic fever is a disorder with a presumed post-streptococcal autoimmune etiology. The
      streptococcal pathogenesis of rheumatic fever is supported by studies that have demonstrated
      the effectiveness of penicillin prophylaxis in preventing recurrences of this illness. A
      trial of penicillin prophylaxis in the PANDAS subgroup demonstrated that penicillin was not
      superior to placebo as prophylaxis against GABHS infections in these children, but this
      outcome was felt to be secondary to non-compliance with treatment, and there was no decrease
      in the number of neuropsychiatric symptom exacerbations in this group. In a study comparing
      azithromycin and penicillin, both drugs were completely effective in preventing
      streptococcal infections - there were no documented titer elevations during the year-long
      study period for children taking either penicillin or azithromycin. Comparable reductions in
      the severity of tics and obsessive-compulsive symptoms were also observed. Thus, penicillin
      was not performing as an ""active placebo"" as originally postulated, but rather provided
      effective prophylaxis against Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal. Both azithromycin and
      penicillin appear to be effective in eliminating GABHS infections, and reducing
      neuropsychiatric symptom severity; thus, between-group differences are negligible. Since
      increasing the ""n"" to demonstrate superiority of one prophylactic agent over another would
      be impractical, we have amended the study design to address two issues:

        1. To determine if antibiotics prophylaxis against GABHS infections is superior to placebo
           in prolonging periods of remission among children in the PANDAS subgroup.

        2. To determine if antibiotics prophylaxis against GABHS infections is superior to placebo
           in improving overall symptom severity for obsessive-compulsive symptoms and tics among
           children in the PANDAS subgroup.

      Because penicillin has a narrower therapeutic index and is less expensive than azithromycin,
      it is the preferable prophylactic agent. Further, penicillin (250 mg orally twice a day) has
      a long history of providing safe and effective prophylaxis for rheumatic fever and is the
      first line oral therapy recommended by the American Heart Association. Thus, penicillin has
      been chosen as the prophylactic antibiotic in the present study. Blister packs are used to
      increase compliance and to allow for easier documentation of missed doses.

NCT00094900,Interleukin-1 Trap to Treat Autoinflammatory Diseases,"
      Autoinflammatory diseases are illnesses characterized by episodes of inflammation that,
      unlike autoimmune disorders, lack the production of high titer autoantibodies or
      antigen-specific T cells. There is growing genetic and clinical evidence that Interleukin-1
      (IL-1) plays a pathogenic role in several of these diseases. This exploratory study aims to
      examine the utility of the experimental drug candidate, IL 1 Trap (Regeneron
      Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) in the treatment of adult subjects with the autoinflammatory
      disorders Neonatal Onset Multisystem Inflammatory Disease (NOMID), Muckle-Wells Syndrome
      (MWS), and Familial Cold Autoinflammatory Syndrome (FCAS), Familial Mediterranean Fever
      (FMF), and adult Still's disease. FMF is associated with mutations in pyrin encoding MEFV.
      NOMID, MWS and FCAS are associated with mutations in cryopyrin-encoding CIAS1.

      This pilot study is designed to address: 1) the utility of IL 1 Trap in the treatment of
      subjects with diseases known to respond to IL-1 blockade (NOMID/MWS/FCAS) as shown by
      response to treatment with anakinra [Kineret]; 2) the response to IL-1 blockade of subjects
      with Adult Still's disease and colchicine-resistant FMF once the efficacy of IL-1 Trap has
      been established in NOMID/MWS/FCAS subjects; and 3) the biochemistry and genetics of
      autoinflammatory diseases and IL-1 related inflammation.

      IL-1 Trap is a recombinant fusion protein with picomolar affinity for IL-1 and a half-life
      of approximately 7.5 days in humans. This agent is currently in Phase 2 clinical studies for
      the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and initial studies have shown activity against
      clinical and biochemical indicators of inflammation. Compared with anakinra, this agent may
      exhibit improved dosing convenience, potential for fewer injection site reactions, and
      improved efficacy due to the extremely high affinity of IL-1Trap for its target.

      In this study, biochemical, genetic, and clinical correlates of autoinflammatory disease
      will initially be measured at baseline following a withdrawal of any TNF or IL-1 inhibitor
      medications where applicable. Subjects will receive a course of therapy with IL-1 Trap that
      is predicted to provide an estimated 3-4 weeks of anti-inflammatory activity. Clinical,
      biochemical, and genetic correlates of inflammation will be measured at appropriate
      intervals to ascertain response and to further elucidate disease mechanisms. Subjects will
      be eligible, based on clinical response, to enter a 1- year extension phase with IL-1 Trap.
      Those subjects who complete the 1-year extension phase, and maintain improved clinical and
      laboratory parameters compared to baseline values, may continue to receive study medication
      at their current dose until the study drug is commercially available.

      Investigator comment:

      This protocol (from the NIH standpoint) is a continuation of the ongoing protocol
      05-AR-0014, with a new change in study sponsor, the NIH replacing Regeneron as sponsor. this
      protocol therefore still contains background and procedural information that refer to
      patients with FMF and FCAS and or MWS and Still's disease, however only patients with
      Still's disease will be newly enrolled from this point on, enrollment for the FCAS and or
      MWS patients has already been completed and it has been decided to not enroll any more FMF
      patients because the number of subjects is too low to reach reasonable conclusions, in
      addition it has been difficult to recruit patients that are eligible. The background section
      and study procedures have largely been left as in the currently IRB approved protocol.

NCT00342199,Surveillance of Streptococcal Infections in Children in India,"
      Information from this study is needed to plan an eventual trial of a GAS vaccine in India if
      and when one is available. A GAS vaccine is currently a priority of the Indian Council for
      Medical Research (ICMR), and this project has been approved by the Joint Working Group (US
      and Indian Delegates) of the Vaccine Action Program, a joint effort of the ICMR and NIAID to
      implement cooperative efforts between the two countries on mutual objectives in vaccine
      development. Currently, several GAS vaccines are in development, supported by NIAID, and
      other sources, and one candidate is in phase one clinical trial authorized by the FDA.
      Information on the antigenic structure of GAS isolated in India will be needed for planning
      vaccine composition. It is the view of the Indian Ministry of Health and Indian Council for
      Medical Research that eventual prevention and control of rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart
      disease in India, now a heavy burden on the children will require a GAS vaccine, which
      requires both access to primary health care and a vaccine if and when it is available.

      Information on incidence is needed to determine the size of a future vaccine cohort in order
      to obtain a statistically significant result on vaccine efficacy. Although unrelated to
      vaccine development, information on the incidence of GAS pharyngitis is needed in India to
      implement primary and secondary acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and rheumatic heart disease
      (RHD) prevention programs as were implemented in the USA and Europe forty years ago.

      A vaccine trial is not part of this study, nor is there any intervention, other than
      antibiotic treatment of all children volunteers who develop GAS pharyngitis or impetigo.

      An additional point should be made about the importance of obtaining epidemiological data on
      streptococcal disease in India, and on the emm types of GAS that cause infections. The
      population of India is over one billion people, representing nearly twenty five percent of
      the world's population. Information on GAS epidemiology from India is scant to say the
      least, and it is sorely needed. We now know that streptococcal toxic shock syndrome and
      fasciitis that have occurred in the U. S., Europe, Australia, and Japan, with greater
      frequency in recent years are caused by several genetically similar emm types of GAS. The
      implication of such genetic and epidemiologic data is that these genetically related strains
      have spread worldwide, Current information from India is far too limited to know if these
      virulent strains of GAS occur in India, and if they do, to what extent might they be the
      cause of frequent invasive disease in hospitalized patients.

      Equally important, we do not know if a potentially high virulent GAS strain is currently
      emerging in some locale(s) in India, and what possible threat it might become, if it were to
      be transported to other worldwide geographic regions. Although not a specific aim of this
      proposal, the surveillance conducted to accomplish the aims of this protocol will provide
      essential information on the possible emergence of an unexpected emm type with pathogenic
      potential.

      body's joints. It can also involve fever, rash, anemia, and inflammation in various parts of
      the body. Rilonacept is a drug that can reduce inflammation. The purpose of this study is to
      determine whether a rilonacept drug regimen initiated early is more effective than a similar
      rilonacept drug regimen initiated 4 weeks later when treating children and young adults with
      SJIA.

      Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is a common inflammatory condition affecting elderly people and
      involving the girdles. The mainstay of treatment is oral glucocorticoids (GC), with the
      recent BSR-BHPR guidelines suggesting an initial prednisone dose comprised between 15 and 20
      mg as appropriate. However, probably because of the dramatic response of PMR to GC,
      randomized controlled trials of treatment are lacking. As a result, there is no evidence
      from controlled studies on the efficacy of different initial doses or drug tapering.
      Objective of the study: to test if 12.5 mg prednisone/day is an adequate starting dose in
      polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) and to evaluate clinical predictors of drug response.

      Methods: 60 consecutive PMR patients will be treated with a starting dose of 12,5 mg/day
      prednisone. Clinical, laboratory, and ultrasonographic features will be recorded as possible
      predictors of response to prednisone. Remission is defined as disappearance of at least 75%

      rhinitis. Penghu in 1994 for children aged 7 to 14 by the study found that among 7599
      people, 1766 people have allergic rhinitis, about 23.2%. Allergic rhinitis is a complex
      chronic disease. So, it become a diagnostic challenge, its prevalence always underestimated.
      The prevalence of rhinitis has increased in recent years. The phenomenon of underestimate is
      caused by variety of personal and environmental factors. Allergic rhinitis had increased

      Acute rheumatic Fever (ARF) results from an autoimmune response due to molecular mimicry
      between the M-protein on the group A β-hemolytic streptococci (GABHS) cell membrane and
      cardiac myosin, and may lead through recurrent or sustained inflammation to Rheumatic Heart
      Disease (RHD). RHD remains a major contributor to morbidity and premature death in the
      working age population in Nepal. Secondary prevention with regular oral or intravenous
      administration of penicillin continued until early adulthood is recommended to prevent the
      progression of the development of endocarditis and subsequent valvular dysfunction.

      Screening for rheumatic heart disease using echocardiography has the potential to detect
      rheumatic valvular lesions at an earlier, clinically silent stage, as compared to clinical
      examination alone and might have a beneficial impact on long-term outcome of children with
      RHD. Schoolchildren aged 5-15 years from several public and private schools from rural and
      urban areas in Southeastern Nepal will be screened for RHD using portable echocardiography.

      Three main inter-related objectives will be pursued in three phases of the study: In a first
      phase using a cross sectional approach, the prevalence of clinical and subclinical RHD will
      be investigated among a representative sample of schoolchildren from public and private

NCT01920373,Platelet-Rich Plasma vs Corticosteroid Injection as Treatment for Degenerative Pathology of the Temporomandibular Joint,"
      1.0 BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESES

      1.1 Osteoarthritis is a continuous and entirely physiologic adaptive process that occurs in
      every joint. These include the replication of cells that produce matrix, enzymes, protease
      inhibitors, cytokines, and other peptides. Along with the synthesis of new tissue there is a
      release of breakdown products into the synovial fluid. Enzymes and phagocytes are required
      to clear these breakdown products. Normal tissue turnover involves synthesis and breakdown
      in well-regulated balance. In the degenerative state this balance is upset producing
      inflammation-derived alterations to the synovium, cartilage, capsule, tendons, and bone.
      Common causes of such alterations include increased loading, physical stress, and traumatic
      injury to the joint.

      1.2 The rationale for the use of corticosteroids in temporomandibular joint therapy is that
      they inhibit prostaglandin synthesis and decrease the activity of collagenase and other
      enzymes that degrade the articular cartilage. Platelet rich plasma is a novel therapeutic
      agent that has several potential advantages over corticosteroids for the treatment of
      degenerative pathology of the temporomandibular joint. Platelet rich plasma has been shown
      to have anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and anti-bacterial properties. It also restores
      intra-articular hyaluronic acid, increases glycosaminoglycan condrocyte synthesis, balances
      joint angiogenesis, and provides a scaffold for stem cell migration. Autologous platelet
      rich plasma injections for treatment of knee cartilage degenerative lesions and
      osteoarthritis have shown longer efficacy than hyaluronic acid injections in reducing pain
      and recovering articular function. Similarly, platelet rich plasma has shown to have better
      outcomes than corticosteroid injections in the management of lateral epicondylitis, and
      better outcomes than hyaluronic acid injections in the management of osteochondral lesions
      of the talus.

      1.3 Current treatments for degeneration and osteoarthritis of the temporomandibular joint
      are focused primarily on palliation by reducing inflammation and inflammatory mediators.
      This study seeks to validate a therapeutic agent that has the potential to actively prevent
      the progression of degeneration in addition to reducing pain and inflammation

      post-operative rheumatoid arthritis flare (RA). This study hopes to understand RA flare
      after total joint replacement surgery and what the result of flaring is for patients over
      the next year. We will ask patients about their RA, whether it has gotten worse, and whether
      they are able to work with the physical therapist. During the course of this study, we'll be
      collecting questionnaires, and we'll be drawing blood to better understand what's going on
      with RA and with a patient's recuperation from their joint replacement.

      We want to understand whether a flare of RA might affect the outcome of a patient's joint
      replacement. We believe this study might show us how to better manage patients with
      rheumatoid arthritis following a joint replacement. If RA patients who flare are unable to
      participate in physical therapy and do worse after one year after a total hip replacement,
      more effective treatment could be developed. The study will also help us to identify early
      factors that may influence long-term outcomes of joint replacements in RA patients.

      Rheumatic fever (RF) is an autoimmune disease that is mediated by the cellular and humoral

      most serious complication is rheumatic heart disease (RHD), one of the most common problems

      estimated that 60% of all acute rheumatic fever cases will develop RHD.

      The pathogenesis of RHD is complex with both environmental and genetic factors contributing
      to its etiology. The investigators know little about the genetic etiology, cellular events
      and modifiers of progression of RHD, and there exists a wide range of disease severity and

      In this project, a massage therapist will teach parents how to provide a massage to their
      child with JIA at bedtime, at home. The feasibility of establishing a home MT program for
      children with JIA will be evaluated. In addition, the effects of MT on JIA will be examined.

      This proposal is relevant to JIA families, who ask questions on MT to professionals of the
      JIA clinic.

      Beyond providing education to JIA families, this project demonstrates the team approach to
      JIA management. Team members will include a pediatric rheumatology nurse and a massage
      therapist.

      The investigators will include patients attending outpatient clinic in the area of
      Orthopedics and Traumatology of our hospital with a diagnosis of unilateral Patellofemoral
      Pain Syndrome. Inclusion criteria are: age between fifteen and thirty-five years, presenting
      unilateral PFPS with six months of evolution, presenting anterior or retro knee pain that
      presents itself when undergoing two or more of the following activities: squatting, running,
      kneeling, jumping, or climbing stairs; physically active patients, with at least thirty
      minutes of physical activity at least three times per week. Exclusion criteria include
      patients with previous knee surgeries, chronic pain with more than one year of evolution,
      pregnancy or suspected pregnancy, application of intra-articular steroids in the three
      months prior to their evaluation, patients with meniscal injuries, ligament or
      intra-articular knee structures, degenerative diseases such as diabetes, rheumatoid
      arthritis, OA of the knee, hip or ankle, history of dislocation or subluxation of patella,
      Osgood Schlatter syndrome and patellar tendinitis or quadriceps.

      The investigators will divide patients into two groups. The control group will receive
      treatment with acetaminophen and physical therapy rehabilitation, closed chain exercises and
      stretches at home intended for the strengthening of quadriceps, abductors and internal
      rotators of the hip for the duration of six weeks. The experimental treatment group will
      receive the above plus the application of the technique NUCAP Medical Upper Knee Spider ®
      Kinesio taping on the affected knee. Both groups will be evaluated by an external
      consultation. They will be assessed by the Tegner Activity Scale, the Kujala score of the
      WOMAC and visual analog scale (VAS) for pain assessment; these scales will be applied at the
      beginning, third and sixth week. The patients in the experimental group will be quoted each
      week to change the tape. The control group will be quoted at the beginning, at three weeks
      and after six weeks. During the first appointment we will take patients anthropometric
      measurements (weight, height, BMI) as well as general information. Radiographic studies
      (anteroposterior and lateral knee, plus the projection Merchant) will be sought to rule out
      other diseases and see the degree of contact of the patella on the patellofemoral joint. All
      patients will receive an explanation about their illness, and a booklet with the required
      exercises as well as their frequency.

      For patients to be included in the group of Spider ® Taping, Kinesio Tape pre-cut strips
      that were placed inferior to the head with no pressure applied, then two bands are placed at
      the ends of the tape and crossed on the edges of the patella and ending at the thigh to
      finish applying moderate tension to place them, then two strips were placed at each end of
      the edges of the first and second tape without applying pressure. The tapes can last up to
      five days on the extremities while maintaining their purpose, patients included in this
      group will be summoned each week to remove the tapes and place new ones.

      Rheumatic heart disease remains a major challenge in low and middle income countries. Early
      detection of clinically silent valvular lesions by screening echocardiography allows timely
      implementation of secondary antibiotic prevention, and may prevent progression of disease to
      severe valvular damage and heart failure. The objective of the study is to assess the
      prevalence of rheumatic heart disease among schoolchildren in Arequipa, Peru. Subsequently,
      the investigators will evaluate progression of disease in children with early stages of
      subclinical rheumatic heart disease.

      The investigators will perform a population-based observational survey for rheumatic heart
      disease using portable echocardiography among schoolchildren aged 5 to 16 years from
      randomly selected public and private schools. Rheumatic heart disease will be documented

NCT02498808,Interferon-lambda: Novel Biologics for Controlling Neutrophil-mediated Pathology in Rheumatic Diseases?,"
      Neutrophils emerge as key immune cells in the initiation and perpetuation of immune
      responses in autoimmune diseases. They display marked abnormalities in phenotype and
      function in various autoimmune diseases, including systemic vasculitis, systemic lupus
      erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

      These neutrophils are characterised by an extended life span, increased capacity to produce
      reactive oxygen species, active gene expression and release of extracellular traps.
      Consequently, there is a need for better understanding of neutrophil phenotype and functions
      in these conditions, as well as for identifying molecules capable of specifically
      manipulating neutrophil function. The investigators have recently discovered that interferon
      lambdas (IFN-λs), also known as interleukin 28 (IL28) and interleukin 29 (IL29), class II
      cytokines with previously studied anti-viral biological functions, specifically suppress
      neutrophil infiltration and interleukin-1β production and thereby, halt and reverse the
      development of collagen induced arthritis (CIA). The investigators propose to further
      investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms behind this suppression and examine the
      translational potential of the investigators' finding by examining the IFN-λ receptor
      expression and function in neutrophils isolated from the blood of healthy donors and
      rheumatic patients (early rheumatoid arthritis and vasculitis).

NCT00115895,The Dose of Radioactive Iodine Needed to Ablate the Thyroid Remnant Left Behind After Thyroidectomy,"
      The thyroid cells take up iodine, and radioactive iodine is commonly used to irradiate
      residual thyroid tissue and thyroid cancer following surgical removal of the thyroid gland
      (thyroidectomy). A whole body radioactive iodine scanning is usually carried out after
      thyroidectomy to assess the amount of thyroid tissue left behind at surgery (that might
      still contain cancer), and to evaluate the presence of iodine avid lesions elsewhere in the
      body (that might be cancer metastases). A large dose of radioactive iodine is often given,
      still the optimal iodine dose to ablate the thyroid remnant after surgery is not known. In
      this study, two radioactive iodine doses are compared in the ablation of the thyroid
      remnant, a smaller (1110 MBq) dose and a larger (3700 MBq) dose. The study participants are
      randomly allocated using a 1:1 ratio to receive either the smaller or the larger radioactive
      iodine dose. These treatments are compared for safety, adverse effects, and the need for
      subsequent repeat treatments. The individual absorbed radiation doses are measured. The
      study hypothesis is that fewer repeat radioiodine treatments might be needed after the
      larger dose, but the larger dose might be associated with a higher frequency of adverse
      events.

NCT00150124,Block-replacement Therapy During Radioiodine Therapy,"
      Background: The use of radioactive iodine (131I) therapy as the definite cure of
      hyperthyroidism is widespread. According to a survey on the management of Graves' disease,
      thirty per cent of physicians prefer to render their patients euthyroid by antithyroid drugs
      (ATD) prior to 131I therapy. This strategy is presumably chosen to avoid 131I induced
      'thyroid storm', which, however, is rarely encountered. Several studies have consistently
      shown that patients who are treated with ATD prior to 131I therapy have an increased risk of
      treatment failure. Mostly, patients with Graves' disease have been studied, while other
      studies were addressed also toxic nodular goiter. Thus, it is generally accepted that ATD
      have 'radioprotective' properties, although this view is almost exclusively based on
      retrospective data and is still under debate. Indeed, this dogma was recently challenged by
      two randomized trials in Graves' disease, none of which showed such an adverse effect of
      methimazole pretreatment. It cannot be excluded that the earlier results may have been under
      influence of selection bias, a source of error almost unavoidable in retrospective studies.
      Whether ATD is radioprotective also when used in the post 131I period has also been debated.
      In the early period 131I therapy following a transient rise in the thyroid hormones is seen
      which may give rise to discomfort in some patients. The continuous use of ATD during 131I
      therapy, possibly in combination with levothyroxine (BRT: block-replacement therapy), leads
      to more stable levels of the thyroid hormones. By resuming ATD following 131I therapy,
      euthyroidism can usually be maintained until the destructive effect of 131I ensues.
      Nevertheless, many physicians prefer not to resume ATD, probably due to reports supporting
      that such a strategy reduces the cure rate. Parallel to the issue of ATD pretreatment, the
      evidence is based on retrospective studies and the ideal set-up should be reconsidered. To
      underscore the importance of performing randomized trials we showed recently that resumption
      of methimazole seven days after 131I therapy had no influence on the final outcome.

      Aim:To clarify by a randomized trial whether BRT during radioiodine therapy of hyperthyroid
      patients influences the final outcome of this therapy, in a comparison with a regime in
      which methimazole as mono-therapy is discontinued 8 days before radioiodine.

      or a toxic nodular goiter (n=50) are included. All patients are rendered euthyroid by
      methimazole (MMI) and randomized either to stop MMI eight days before 131I or to be set on

      activity (max. 600 MBq) includes an assessment of the 131I half-life and the thyroid volume.

      Hospital and University of British Columbia Orbital Services, Singapore Eye Research
      Institute, Singapore General Hospital Endocrinology and Radiology Departments and Tan Tock
      Seng Hospital Rheumatology Department is planned. The SingHealth-SGH High Field MR Research
      Laboratory will be involved in the MR imaging of the trial patients.

      Patients who satisfy the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be asked to participate in
      this trial. After informed consent (Appendix B) is obtained, each patient will be randomized
      into one of two treatment arms: 1) Intravenous high-dose pulsed methylprednisolone (1 gram
      infusion over 1 hour per day with a total of 3 doses over 3 days; 4 cycles at 6 weekly
      intervals) and oral placebo and 2) Intravenous high-dose pulsed methylprednisolone (same
      dose) plus oral methotrexate 7.5 mg per week for 2 weeks, increased to 10 mg per week for
      another 2 weeks then 12.5 mg per week for 5 months (total 6 months of methotrexate
      treatment). Depending on patient response, the dose can be further increased by 2.5mg per
      week every 4 weeks to a maximum of 20 mg per week. A strict management protocol will be
      observed for each recruited patient. Patients who develop adverse side effects or need for
      surgical intervention will receive appropriate treatment (i.e. treatment will deviate from
      the protocol but will continue to be monitored). Patients who refuse treatment will be
      observed clinically and with imaging as a natural control group until such time as
      intervention is accepted.

      The patients will have a baseline assessment followed by regular visits to assess treatment
      response and adverse effects. Observations will include the use of an inflammatory index,
      motility measurements including quantitative ductions, exophthalmometry readings, palpebral
      aperture readings and indices of optic nerve function. With regards to the imaging, the
      patients will be assessed with an initial quantitative CT scan and 3-Tesla MRI scan prior to
      treatment. After treatment is started, patients will also undergo repeat MRI scan at 24
      weeks and 72 weeks to assess quantitative changes with treatment using the Muscle Diameter
      Index (MDI) and Pixel Value Ratio (PVR) for the inferior rectus, superior rectus, the medial
      rectus, lateral rectus and orbital fat (Appendix E). Serum and urine will be obtained at the
      same time intervals as the MRI scan to assess levels of thyroid hormones, thyroid antibodies
      and urinary glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Free T4, free T3 and TSH will be recorded to monitor
      control of hyperthyroidism. Thyroid antibodies measured will include thyroid stimulating
      immunoglobulin (TSI), thyrotropin-binding inhibition antibody (TB II), thyroid peroxidase
      antibodies and thyroglobulin antibody. Other tests including the full blood count, urea and
      electrolytes will be run prior to each dose of steroid treatment and during follow-up to
      monitor for adverse effects.

      The results of the assessments will be analyzed for significant differences in treatment
      response between the 2 groups. The indices of interest will include the percentage of
      patients in each group who demonstrate a decrease in the inflammatory index of at least 2
      points and the time taken for 50% of patients to show such a decrease. Other parameters that
      reflect the visual function and motility will be compared at different points in time after
      starting treatment to observe response and sustainability of response. From the serial MRI
      scans, quantitative analysis of orbital tissues will be done to identify changes with
      treatment. Antibody and GAG levels will be analyzed to detect any change with treatment. The
      types and frequency of adverse side effects in the 2 groups will also be assessed.

      80 normal subjects will be recruited for MRI scan of the orbits and brain to obtain
      normative values for the MDI and PVR for the Asian population (Appendix E). This will
      include 20 subjects from each of 4 decades (21-30 years, 31-40 years, 41-50 years, 51-60
      years).

      The normative data will also be used to create a virtual orbital atlas. This aspect of the

NCT00432146,Effect of Lugol's Solution in the Patients With Graves' Disease,"
      Context: Although some of endocrine surgeons administer Lugol's solution to decrease thyroid
      gland vascularity, there is still no agreement on its effectiveness.

      Objective: The aims of this clinical trial are to evaluate thyroid blood flow and
      microvessel density in the patients with Graves' disease according to the Lugol's solution
      treatment preoperatively.

      Design: Retrospective clinical trial. Setting: A tertiary referral center. Method:
      Thirty-six patients were randomly assigned to preoperative medication with Lugol's solution.
      Patients in group 1 (n=17) received Lugol's solution for 10 days before surgical
      intervention, whereas patients in group 2 (n=19) didn't receive it.

      Main Outcome Measures: Blood flow through the thyroid arteries of patients with Graves'
      disease was measured by color flow Doppler ultrasonography. The microvessel density (MVD)
      was assessed immunohistochemically and Western blot analysis using the level of expression
      of CD-34 in thyroid tissue. The thyroid gland's weight and blood loss were measured in all

NCT00588432,Characterization of Skeletal Muscle Using Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE),"
      The goal of this proposal is two-fold: (1) to further develop and validate a technology,
      magnetic resonance elastography (MRE), for quantitatively imaging mechanical properties and
      tension distribution in muscle and (2) to apply the technique for in vivo evaluation of
      patients with four common, and clinically significant muscle disorders (spasticity, disuse
      atrophy, myofascial pain and a metabolic myopathy). These studies will employ a magnetic
      resonance imaging sequence with synchronous motion-sensitizing gradients to map propagating
      shear waves in the muscle. The technique will assess the mechanical properties of the muscle
      and its tension distribution. Specifically, the study can be divided into three specific
      aims. Aim 1: Optimize MRE methods of acquisition and analysis for the assessment of muscle,
      including electromechanical drivers, data acquisition techniques, and methods for image
      analysis. Advanced techniques for very rapid MRE assessment of muscle will continue to be
      developed. Aim 2: Validate the MRE assessment of muscle properties and tension with phantom,
      ex-vivo muscle, and Finite Element Modeling (FEM) techniques. Finite Element Analysis will
      be performed by using both phantom and bovine muscles to better correlate MRE wave-length
      findings as function of muscle properties, tension and fiber architecture. Aim 3: Study In
      Vivo Normal and Abnormal Muscle. The MRE technique will be applied in vivo to provide
      elastographic images of abnormal muscle with known disorders. The patient groups chosen for
      study are each important in their own right, and furnish unique information across the
      spectrum of muscular disease and dysfunction. Groups to be studied include individuals with
      new onset of spasticity following an ischemic, hemispheric stroke, disuse atrophy as a
      result of immobilization, metabolic (hyperthyroid) myopathy and myofascial pain for trigger
      point identification. The overall hypothesis of this work is that will bring benefits to
      both basic research and clinical care.

NCT00593047,LDL-Cholesterol Lowering Effect of KB2115 as Add on to Statin,"
      Thyroid hormones are known to reduce cholesterol levels through regulation of a number of
      key enzymes involved in synthesis, degradation, and lipid transport. However, the currently
      marketed thyroid agonists are non-selective, and cannot be used for the treatment of
      hypercholesterolemia due to extrahepatic consequences of hyperthyroidism, especially on
      heart, bone, and muscle.

      To take advantage of thyroid hormone effect on lipid metabolism for the treatment of
      hypercholesterolemia, it is necessary to develop a selective thyroid receptor agonist that
      can induce hyperthyroidism in the liver, while an euthyroid state is preserved in the
      extrahepatic tissue. KB2115 is a thyroid agonist developed to be liver selective.

      The purpose of the study is to assess the efficacy and safety of KB2115 as add on therapy to
      low and middle doses of statin following 12 weeks of exposure compared to placebo. The aim
      of the study is to assess efficacy (LDL-cholesterol lowering effects) and safety of KB2115
      at doses between 25 and 100 µg and to define a clinically relevant dose or dose range for

NCT00739362,Effects of Brain Stimulation on Food Intake and Behavioral Weight Loss Treatment,"
      This study will determine whether electrical stimulation of an area of the brain called the
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which is important in determining the feeling of fullness
      after eating, affects how much food a person eats and weight loss over 4 weeks. It will also
      compare weight changes in people who attend weight loss counseling sessions and those who do
      not over this period of time.

      Obese, non-diabetic people between 18 and 60 years of age who are in good health and who
      live in the Phoenix, AZ, metropolitan area are eligible for this study. Candidates must have
      a body mass index of 35 kg/m(2) or more and weigh less than 350 pounds.

      Participants are admitted to the NIH inpatient unit in Phoenix for the first 9 days of the
      study for tests, which include meal tests to determine eating behaviors and caloric intake,
      blood and urine tests, glucose tolerance test, weight measurement, psychological assessments
      and DEXA scan to measure body fat. For 3 of the days, they will be asked to eat all of their
      food from automated vending machines. Some subjects receive transcranial direct current
      stimulation (TDCS). For this procedure, electrodes that conduct electricity are placed on
      the head and arm and the current is turned on for 40 minutes. Some tingling may be felt
      under the electrodes. Other subjects receive sham TDCS, with the current turned on only very
      briefly.

      After the evaluations, subjects are discharged home from the NIH unit and instructed to eat
      25 percent fewer calories than they consumed while on a weight maintenance diet the first 3
      days of their inpatient stay. They maintain the lower calorie diet at home for 4 weeks.
      During this period they come to the NIH unit 3 days a week to receive either real or sham
      TDCS. Some subjects are also assigned to receive weight loss counseling sessions twice a
      week, while others are not. At the end of the 4 weeks, subjects return to the NIH unit for a
      5-day stay to undergo a repeat DEXA scan, meal tests, psychological assessment and blood
      tests, and they will eat for another 3 days from the vending machines.

      At the completion of the study, all participants may choose to receive 4 more weeks of TDCS

      This is a randomized, prospective equivalence trial on the safety of the Ligasure Vessel
      Sealing System as used in thyroid surgery. The Ligasure system is a hand held surgical
      device that uses heat to seal blood vessels during surgery. It has been a tested and
      accepted technology in abdominal surgery and it is now being applied to surgery of the
      thyroid gland because it is faster than the traditional method of tying blood vessels that a
      surgeon must do manually. To remove the thyroid gland safely the surgeon must dissect the
      gland away from the recurrent laryngeal nerve which controls the vocal cords and patient's
      voice. Protecting this nerve is the key step in all thyroid surgery as its damage can
      permanently alter a patient's voice and even obstruct the airway. At this time the worldwide
      accepted rate of nerve injury is 2 in 100 patients. The hypothesis of this study is that the
      nerve injury rates for surgery using the Ligasure device are similar to that seen when
      surgeons manually tie blood vessels. The investigators protocol will evaluate the function
      of the recurrent laryngeal nerve after removing the thyroid gland using the Ligasure device
      in comparison to the traditional method where the surgeon manually ties blood vessels. In
      this study, for patients undergoing total thyroidectomy for a benign condition, each patient
      will be randomized to have one lobe of thyroid (left or right) removed using manual tying of
      blood vessels and the other side will have the surgeon use the Ligasure device to seal blood
      vessels. Every patient has a pre− and post−operative independent assessment of vocal cord
      function using nasopharyngoscopy to ensure that the vocal cords are working normally prior
      to surgery and also to document vocal cord dysfunction if there is an injury to the
      recurrent laryngeal nerve. The investigators intent is to show that the Ligasure system is a
      safe method to sealing vessels in thyroid surgery and that the thermal dispersion of this
      device does not pose a significant increase in risk to the recurrent laryngeal nerve

NCT01182285,A Phase II Trial of Valproic Acid in Patients With Advanced Thyroid Cancers of Follicular Cell Origin,"
      Background:

        -  Patients who have advanced thyroid cancer have a low long-term survival rate. These
           types of thyroid cancer do not respond well to conventional surgery or radiation, or to
           specific thyroid cancer treatments such as radioactive iodine treatment and thyroid
           hormone for thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression.

        -  Valproic acid has long been approved as an anticonvulsant to treat seizures in patients
           with epilepsy. It has also been used to treat bipolar disorder. Recent studies have
           shown that valproic acid has promising effects in thyroid cancer treatment because it
           may help destroy cancer cells and help conventional treatments be more effective.
           However, valproic acid is not approved for thyroid cancer and is therefore an
           investigational drug.

      Objectives:

        -  To determine whether valproic acid can inhibit tumor growth or induce tumor cell death.

        -  To determine whether valproic acid can make tumor cells increase their uptake of
           radioiodine.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have advanced-stage thyroid cancer that is either
      unresponsive to conventional treatments or fails to absorb radioiodine.

      Design:

        -  Eligible participants will continue on the standard thyroid hormone suppression therapy
           and begin receiving valproic acid for a total of 10 weeks. Participants will keep a
           study diary to record doses and side effects, and will have regular clinic visits to
           provide blood samples and receive additional valproic acid.

        -  After 10 weeks, participants will have a Thyrogen scan to measure radioiodine uptake
           after valproic acid therapy. Tumor biopsies and blood samples will be taken at this
           time.

        -  If there is increased radioiodine uptake on the scan, participants will have additional
           radioiodine therapy.

        -  If there is no increased uptake on the scan, participants will continue on valproic
           acid for 7 more weeks. After 16 total weeks of treatment, additional blood samples and
           scans will be taken. Participants may continue to take valproic acid if the thyroid
           cancer appears to be responding to the treatment.

        -  Follow-up visits will be scheduled at 3, 6, 9 (for patients continuing on valproic acid
           only), and 12 months.

      Radioactive iodine therapy is often part of the standard treatment for Papillary Thyroid
      Carcinoma (PTC) patients. However, in many patients, tumors develop a resistance or no
      longer respond to radioactive iodine therapy (iodine-refractory). Several lines of evidence
      suggest that blocking the BRAF gene may help to re-sensitize the tumors to radioactive
      iodine. BRAF is a protein that plays a central role in the growth and survival of cancer
      cells in some types of PTC. The investigational drug GSK2118436 may work by blocking the
      BRAF protein in cancer cells lines and tumors that have a mutated BRAF gene.

      In this research study, the investigators are looking to see if GSK2118436 can re-sensitize
      iodine-refractory PTC to radioactive iodine therapy. The investigators are also looking at
      the safety of adding GSK2118436 to radioactive iodine therapy.

NCT01579344,Lacrimal Drainage System Obstruction Associated to Radioactive Iodine Therapy for Thyroid Carcinoma,"
      The radioactive radioiodine therapy (Na131I) for the treatment of differentiated thyroid
      carcinoma is a procedure used for ablation of remaining thyroid tissue after thyroidectomy
      and metastases. Although serious complications are uncommon after treatment, there are
      well-documented adverse reactions secondary to the involvement of the salivary glands, such
      as dry mouth, pain in the parotid glands and dysphagia, even after administration of low
      doses of radioiodine. However, ocular complications of such treatment are scarcely reported
      in literature.

      Among them the investigators can mention recurrent and chronic conjunctivitis,
      keratoconjunctivitis sicca and dry eye, affecting 23% of patients undergoing radioactive
      iodine therapy. Dysfunction of the lacrimal gland is described in recent studies, especially
      after high cumulative dose of the drug. Likewise, epiphora and nasolacrimal duct obstruction
      have been reported as complications associated with the use of radioiodine, although studies
      are not available to assess its true incidence through the systematic evaluation of
      patients.

      It can be seen in routine practice that these patients would normally be referred for
      ophthalmological examination only if a complaint, what happens in the process of OVL already
      installed after the use of high doses of radioiodine. With the early evaluation of these
      patients, the investigators focused on detecting the process of ongoing obstruction in order
      to study interventions that prevent its final installation.

NCT01789541,Is a Low Thyreotropin Level Predictive of Recurrent Arrhythmia After Catheter Ablative Surgery?,"
      Overt hyperthyroidism (so-called ""goiter"" in lay language) is a hormonal disturbance that is
      known to increase the risk of atrial fibrillation (a common heart arrhythmia with
      potentially severe consequences) in some patients. Previous research has indicated that even
      slight elevations in thyroid hormone levels - so called subclinical hyperthyroidism - may
      increase this risk. When atrial fibrillation and overt hyperthyroidism are found
      simultaneously in a patient, the hormonal imbalance must be treated first in order to later
      resolve the arrhythmia. It is unclear whether this strategy holds true for subclinical
      hyperthyroidism. Our two hypotheses are: 1) Subclinical hyperthyroidism is more prevalent in
      patients admitted for atrial fibrillation ablation than in the population as a whole, and 2)
      Patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism and atrial fibrillation benefit less from ablation
      than others.

      As a control group, we have chosen patients admitted for ablation of AV-nodal Reentry
      Tachycardia at the same clinics as the cases. No correlation has ever been shown between
      AV-nodal Reentry Tachycardia and hyperthyroidism.

NCT01834859,Weight Loss Maintenance and Compensatory Mechanisms Activated With a Very-low Calorie Diet,"
      Very-low calorie diets are relatively safe and effective in inducing significant weight
      loss, when used in selective individuals and under clinical supervision. However, weight
      loss maintenance in the long-term remains the main challenge, with many experiencing a
      significant weight regain. Several compensatory mechanisms are activated under weight
      reduction, both at the level of energy intake (such as increased appetite) and energy
      expenditure (such as reduced energy expenditure), and increase the risk of relapse.

      The main aim of this study is to compare the effect of two multidisciplinary lifestyle
      interventions on weight loss maintenance at one year, after initial weight loss during 8
      weeks very-low calorie diet. Participants will be allocated (non-randomly) to either an

NCT01913743,The Effects of Mindsets on the Brain's Response to Food Cues,"
      Previous studies have shown that obese individuals exhibit greater reward-related brain
      activity in response to food cues than lean individuals and our group has shown that
      successful weight loss maintainers who were previously obese and now maintain a healthy
      weight have increased control-related activity when viewing food cues. These findings
      suggest key roles for both reward-related brain areas and inhibitory control regions in
      eating behavior. However, no studies to date have examined (a) whether the response to food
      cues (i.e., cue-reactivity) can be changed in obese individuals, (b) which strategies are
      most effective at altering brain response to food cues, or (c) the neural mechanisms that
      support such change.

      Given the omnipresent environmental cues to eat and the association between heightened
      reward-responsivity and obesity, it is critical to investigate ways to potentially alter
      food cue-reactivity in the obese. The most widely employed approach for behavioral weight
      loss treatment is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), which incorporates strategies to
      control and change cognitions (e.g., avoid desire to eat tempting foods by focusing on
      something else). This approach is sometimes described as ""change- focused"" because modifying
      negative thoughts is assumed to thereby change associated maladaptive emotions and
      behaviors. Alternatively, emerging evidence suggests Acceptance and Commitment Therapy
      (ACT), which teaches participants to recognize and accept their cravings as feelings that
      need not be acted upon, may also be effective in treating obesity. A third strategy often
      employed in smoking cessation and substance abuse treatment is to focus on the long-term
      consequences of behaviors, however this form of treatment is not typically used in
      behavioral weight loss therapy. Thus although each approach is potentially effective, these
      treatment approaches differ greatly in the cognitive strategies they employ.

      The primary aim of the proposed research is to compare a cognitive strategy used in CBT
      (ʻCHANGEʼ), a cognitive strategy emphasized in ACT (ʻACCEPTʼ), and a cognitive strategy used
      in smoking cessation (ʻLATERʼ) relative to a control condition (ʻNOWʼ), in their
      effectiveness in altering reward and inhibitory control responses to food cues among obese

      Graves' disease (MIM 27500) is the leading cause of hyperthyroidism worldwide. The
      prevalence of Graves' disease is quite high (2.7% in women), and there is solid evidence of
      genetic predisposition. Despite its clinical and scientific significance, Graves' disease is
      still mysterious in terms of its susceptibility genes or pathophysiological mechanisms. The
      immune repertoire, being the sum of T and B lymphocytes in a body at any given time, is both
      a snapshot and a historical record of a person's immune function. Thanks to the power of
      next-generation sequencing (NGS), massively parallel sequencing of the B cell and T cell
      receptors suddenly becomes plausible, and opens a door for many creative approaches to study
      immune related diseases. The ultimate goal of this project is to use both the NGS deep
      sequencing and immune repertoire experiment to perform Graves' disease sub-group genetic
      fine mapping, and to identify Graves' disease-specific T cell and B cell receptors.
      Furthermore, using the immune repertoire approach, investigators want to study the critical
      epitopes of thyroid auto-antigens, and to delineate the pathophysiological steps in various
      disease stages and in various sub-groups. Investigators expect to solve the immune

NCT00026832,Examination of Brain Serotonin Receptors in Patients With Mood Disorders,"
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the function of certain brain chemicals and
      receptors in patients with mood disorders. This study will also examine how the stress
      hormone cortisol affects brain function.

      Data suggest that serotonin 1A (5-HT1A) receptor function is abnormal in patients with mood
      disorders, such as major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BP). However, these
      data are limited because they are based on small sample sizes. In this study, PET scans will
      be used to compare 5-HT1A receptor binding potential between mood disorder patients and
      healthy volunteers.

      All participants will have an initial medical and psychiatric evaluation. Depression
      severity, anxiety, negative thinking, level of functioning, intelligence, and cognitive
      functions will be measured. Urine, saliva, and blood will be collected. Women will have a
      pregnancy test and tests to determine menstrual phase and time of ovulation. Participants
      will undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and PET scans of the brain. Some participants
      will have other procedures such as a lumbar puncture. Participants with Cushing's disease

NCT00047944,MRI Study of Brain Activity and Risk for Depression in Adolescents,"
      Anxiety in children of parents with major depressive disorder (MDD) poses a particularly
      high risk for later-life MDD. In adults, MDD involves dysfunction in prefrontal brain
      regions that regulate attention to emotional stimuli. These abnormalities: i) have been
      found primarily in adults with specific familial forms of MDD; ii) persist after recovery
      from MDD, and iii) relate to anxiety. These findings raise the possibility that risk for MDD
      is tied to dysfunction in prefrontal regions involved in regulation of emotion, which
      possibly manifests as early-life anxiety. If this possibility were confirmed in
      never-depressed adolescents at high risk for MDD, the findings would provide key insights
      into the developmental neurobiology of MDD. The goal of this protocol is to study the neural
      substrate of risk for MDD in young people. This protocol tests the hypothesis that
      adolescents at high risk for MDD by virtue of childhood anxiety and parental history of MDD
      exhibit dysfunction in prefrontal cortex and amygdala, regions involved in emotion
      regulation. This goal will be accomplished through fMRI studies of emotion regulation in
      high and low-risk adolescents.

      For this research, at-risk adolescents will be recruited from participants in an NIMH-funded
      extramural study at New York University (NYU) examining the biology of risk for anxiety and
      depressive disorders. Over a three-year period, 45 high-risk probands and 60 low-risk
      comparisons will be studied, including 20 comparisons from the NYU sample and 40 from the
      Washington DC metropolitan area. In the present protocol, to be conducted at NIH, subjects
      will undergo volumetric MRI scans to assess structural abnormalities in the prefrontal
      cortex and medial temporal lobe. They will complete a series of four out-of-scanner
      cognitive tasks and two fMRI-based cognitive tasks that measure modulation of attention to
      emotional stimuli. The fMRI tasks are hypothesized to differentially engage the prefrontal
      cortex and amygdala in low vs. high risk subjects. These tasks will be used to test the
      hypothesis that at-risk individuals exhibit enhanced amygdala and reduced prefrontal
      activation on the fMRI emotion/attention tasks.

NCT00400088,Lithium Versus Paroxetine in Patients With Major Depression Who Have a Family History of Bipolar Disorder or Suicide,"
      This study is being done to look at how well people respond to two very different drug
      treatments for depression. Clinically, people with depression can respond differently to
      drug treatments for reasons which are not always clear. Some of our own recent research
      suggests that people with depression who have a family history of bipolar disorder or
      completed suicide, may react differently to standard antidepressant medications than those
      without such a family history. Our data shows that family history of completed suicide, as
      well as the known predictor of family history of bipolar disorder, may help identify a
      pre-bipolar high risk group i.e. they currently have depression but at some future date will
      declare a bipolar illness (manic-depression) by virtue of development of a manic episode
      also. Our research suggests that treatment- emergent symptoms in response to a trial of
      antidepressant, such as agitation may be strong predictors of future bipolarity and
      inherently dangerous particularly as they are not ascribed to the antidepressant treatment.
      Finally, it is possible that this subgroup of those with depressive illness may respond
      better and more safely to lithium, a mood stabiliser used in known bipolar depression.

      The objective of this proposal is to investigate response to acute lithium treatment in
      subjects who meet the diagnostic criteria for major depression, but who are potentially at
      risk for bipolar disorder, by virtue of family history of bipolarity or completed suicide.

NCT00632229,"Double Blinded, Placebo-Controlled Trial of Paliperidone Addition in SRI-Resistant Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder","
      Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a common, chronic, and oftentimes disabling disorder.
      The only established treatments for OCD are a specific form of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
      (CBT) and the Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor medications (SRIs). Few patients with OCD
      experience complete symptom resolution with either modality and even after two consecutive
      SRI trials, as many as 30%-40% of patients fail to derive a satisfactory response.
      Pharmacological options for these SRI-resistant cases include switching to a different
      antidepressant, increasing the dose of SRI, or augmentation with another agent.

      Previous studies showed that approximately 33-50% of OCD patients who have not had an
      adequate response to SRI medication had a positive response when an atypical antipsychotic
      medication was added. However, the problematic acute and long-term side effects of these
      medications are of concern and, at times, limit their use. Paliperidone has a number of
      advantages over these medications including fewer drug interactions and better tolerability.
      Thus, this study is designed to determine whether paliperidone augmentation of an existing
      medication is effective relative to taking a placebo and your existing medication.

      recruit students who test positive for moderate to severe depression on the Beck Depression
      Inventory (BDI). Subjects will be randomly assigned to either a treatment or a control
      condition. Those in the treatment group will receive four 90 minute group classes using EFT
      (Emotional Freedom Techniques) to address traumatic memories and other self-identified
      causes of depression. It will compare them to a no treatment control group.

NCT01128764,Integrated Treatment for Comorbid Depression and Obesity in Adolescents,"
      Lifetime prevalence of major depression is estimated at 28% by age 18 (Lewinsohn et al.,
      1999), with higher cumulative rates in females (35%) than males (19%). Approximately 17% of
      children and adolescents in the United States are obese as defined by a BMI above the 95th
      percentile, with more than 30% falling between the 85th and 95th percentiles (Ogden et al.,
      2008). Overweight children and adolescents are at increased risk for type 2 diabetes
      (Pinhas-Hamiel et al., 1996) and overwhelming risk for adult obesity (Guo et al., 1994).
      There is a substantial percentage of adolescents who are both overweight and depressed with
      estimates from clinical samples averaging 25%. Treatment of teens with comorbid medical and
      psychiatric conditions such as overweight/obesity and depression has received little to no
      attention in the psychosocial treatment research literature. Due to the large number of
      adolescents who are both depressed and overweight, developing a behavioral treatment that
      addresses both problems simultaneously has important public health significance. The purpose
      of this proposal is to combine treatments for depression and overweight to address these
      co-occurring conditions in one intervention. The long-term objectives of this research are
      to develop efficient and effective treatments for co-occurring physical and emotional
      disorders. The research program will be divided into 3 major phases: a development phase
      (Stage 1a), a pilot study phase (Stage 1b), and a revision phase. During the development
      phase (Stage 1a), a treatment for overweight teens and CBT treatment for depressed teens
      will be adapted into one integrated protocol that addresses depression using CBT techniques,
      an exercise component, and advice regarding healthy eating. As part of this phase, we will
      adapt existing intervention manuals and therapist training materials, and gain some initial
      clinical experience with the intervention via an open trial with 6 teens. During the
      randomized pilot study phase (Stage 1b), the integrated intervention will be compared to a
      control group receiving CBT treatment for depression alone (N=40 in total). During the pilot
      phase, the feasibility and acceptability of administering the program will be assessed. In
      addition, we will compare change in depressed mood at end of treatment and 6 month follow-up
      periods across the two groups. During the revision phase, the intervention manual will be
      further developed and refined, based on experiences and observations made during the
      development and pilot study phases.

      In trial 1 patients suffering from insomnia but not meeting the criteria for depression are
      randomised to either therapist guided Internet-based CBT for insomnia or to a control group
      with a non-guided, brief self-help program that acts as a placebo control. The primary
      purpose is to evaluate reduction in Insomnia severity (compared to placebo) after treatment
      and at follow-ups at 6-month, 1 year and 3 years. Secondary purpose is to evaluate the
      costeffectiveness of the treatment and to evaluate if the insomnia treatment has a
      preventive effect on future depressive episodes. Recruitment is done through mass media and
      includes all regions of Sweden. Initial assessment based on questionnaires and telephone
      interviews.

      Trial 2 includes patients suffering from both Insomnia and depression. Randomization is done
      between either CBT for insomnia or CBT for depression (both Internet-based) to evaluate each
      respective treatment's effect on both insomnia and depression. The patients need for further
      treatment after the initial one will be measured and used as a secondary outcome.
      Recruitment is done through mass media but only citizens in the Stockholm area are included
      since the initial assessment are based on both questionnaires and telephone interviews as
      well as a visit at a psychiatrist located at the Internet psychiatry clinic in Stockholm.

      Chronic sleep deprivation may constitute an important and potentially correctable behavioral
      factor in the alarming increase in obesity. There are no definitive experimental studies in
      humans showing whether sleep deprivation indeed contributes to increased energy intake
      and/or reduced energy expenditure. The investigators propose a series of novel studies to
      investigate abnormalities in energy homeostasis imparted by sleep deprivation. The
      investigators will measure food intake, energy expenditure (basal metabolic rate, thermal
      effect of food, and non-exercise activity thermogenesis), and neurohormone levels in 24
      healthy subjects with normal BMI (20-25 kg/m2). Twelve subjects (6 men and 6 women) will be
      randomized to sleep deprivation. Measurements will be compared to those obtained in 12
      subjects who are randomized to a control group, and are not sleep deprived. The
      investigators will test the following hypotheses: 1. That sleep deprivation results in
      positive energy balance (increased caloric intake and decreased energy expenditure, as
      reflected by decreased non-exercise activity thermogenesis). 2. That dysregulation of
      appetite and energy expenditure is associated with changes in molecules controlling appetite
      and metabolism. 3. That changes associated with 8 days of modest sleep deprivation resolve,
      at least in part, over a 4 day recovery period.

NCT01469663,Event Related Potentials in Borderline Personality Disorder and Major Depression,"
      This study examines whether depression in people with borderline personality disorder is
      different than depression in people without borderline personality disorder.

      Unlike people who have depression alone (i.e. without borderline personality disorder),
      people with borderline personality disorder have depressions that often do not improve with
      medications. This makes treating depression much more challenging in someone with borderline
      personality disorder than without borderline personality disorder.

      Borderline personality disorderis associated with difficulty in understanding and
      communicating feelings. Impaired emotion processing may reflect dysfunction of an area of
      the brain, the anterior cingulate.

      Depression is associated with changes in anterior cingulate activity. The investigators
      believe that when borderline personality disorder is present with depression, brain activity
      changes in the anterior cingulate will not be the same as in depressed patients without
      borderline personality disorder.

      An electroencephalogram records brain electrical activity. In this study, the investigators
      will measure electroencephalogram indices reflecting anterior cingulate activity.

      HYPOTHESIS: In this study, the investigators predict that when borderline personality is
      present with depression, electroencephalogram indices of anterior cingulate activity will be
      different from when depression is present alone (without borderline personality). This could
      help to explain why people with borderline personality have depressions that are harder to
      treat than depressions in people without borderline personality.

      The investigators also predict that electroencephalogram indices of the anterior cingulate
      will reflect emotional processing ability, as measured by validated questionnaires.

      problems working with others after they have a concussion during deployment. These problems
      may lead to problems with their job and relationships. This study hopes to figure out what
      parts of the brain may be affected in people with these problems after a concussion.

      Objectives:

      - To learn more about the problems that may occur after service members have a concussion
      during deployment and return home.

      Eligibility:

        -  Service members or veterans between 18 and 40 years of age who have had a mild
           traumatic brain injury (concussion) in the past 6 months.

        -  Companions (at least 18 years of age) of the service members will also be included in

NCT01583400,Enhanced Collaborative Depression Treatment in Primary Care: The RESPECT-D-E Trial,"
      Primary care physicians have emerged as the predominant mental health care providers for
      diagnosing and treating depression. The majority of patients with mood disorders receive
      treatment in the primary care setting, within which approximately 10-30% of all patients
      present with a depressive disorder. Comprehensive 'Collaborative Care' models of depression
      management significantly improve depression outcomes and health-related quality of life.
      Core features of these programs include use of a trained depression care manager to closely
      coordinate with primary care clinicians, support treatment recommendations, provide patient
      education, conduct patient follow-up to ensure adequate treatment, and manage as-needed
      access to psychiatrists for patients with more complex presentations. Evidence based
      Collaborative Care models do not currently weave in the use of web-based or mobile
      technologies. These technologies offer unique features that may make collaborative
      depression care more effective. The digital health coaching program for depressive symptoms
      enhanced during Phase I of the current project is a web-based tool featuring video, text,
      links and graphics which provide patients with education, self-management techniques,
      tailored feedback, and tools for tracking treatment progress. The RESPECT-D (Re-engineering
      Systems of Primary Care Treatment of Depression) intervention is a collaborative depression
      management model for primary care. The primary objective of this project is to compare the
      efficacy of an enhanced Collaborative Care model for depression (RESPECT-D-E) to the
      standard model (RESPECT-D) for patients with minor and major depression and dysthymic
      disorder. This study will be a randomized controlled trial with 150 participants who are
      receiving antidepressant medication treatment in the primary care setting. The primary
      objectives are: reduction in subject reported depressive symptoms, improvement in subject
      reported health related quality of life and improvement in subject adherence to treatment
      regimen as demonstrated by self-report measures and clinician-administered assessment. The
      investigators hypothesize that compared to RESPECT-D at 12 weeks, participants randomized to
      RESPECT-D-E will demonstrate: a greater reduction in depressive symptoms, a greater
      improvement in health-related quality of life and a greater satisfaction with quality of
      depression care received.

      - To see if pexacerfont can help reduce stress-induced food cravings.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals between 21 and 65 years of age who are on a diet to control their weight.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. This study
           requires seven visits over about 35 days.

        -  Participants will take either pexacerfont or placebo pills during the study. They will
           have three pills every morning. They will record video of themselves taking the pills
           every day.

        -  Every evening, participants will fill out a questionnaire. It will ask questions about

      The proposed project seeks to meet these needs by testing a web-based guided self-help
      version of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), an evidence-based transdiagnostic
      therapy found to effectively treat a range of psychological problems. An ACT program would
      provide a means of implementing effective treatment for the range of problems in the CCC
      setting, while the guided self-help format would reduce counselors' workload, improving
      cost-effectiveness and reducing waiting lists. This would both treat students and train
      counselors in how to implement the ACT intervention. Three self-help lessons have been
      developed, as well as a counselor portal to review students' use of the program and to
      receive training on implementing ACT guided self-help.

      Cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) is effective in the treatment of adolescent depression. The
      availability of appropriately trained CBT therapist may be limited, especially in primary

NCT02021344,Mental Health First Aid for College Students,"
      Most college students with mental disorders do not receive treatment, and over 80% of those
      who die by suicide have never made contact with campus mental health services. Knowledge,
      stigma, and other health beliefs represent significant barriers to help-seeking for many of
      these students. However, there have been no large-scale intervention studies for reducing
      these barriers to mental health treatment on college campuses. This project will fill this
      gap by determining whether a community mental health education program, Mental Health First
      Aid (MHFA), is an effective method to increase number of students who seek mental health
      services on college campuses. MHFA is an international, 12-hour training program that has
      been shown to increase knowledge of mental illnesses and their treatments, decrease stigma,
      and increase helping behaviors in community members. However, it has not been tested in a
      college setting in the United States. To determine the effectiveness of MHFA in US colleges,
      the proposed project will involve a randomized control trial of the MHFA training program on
      32 campuses representing a range of higher education institutions, from community colleges
      in rural areas to research universities in large, urban areas. The MHFA training program
      will be administered to peer supports such as residential advisors. Administrative data from
      campus mental health services and pre- and post-intervention surveys will be used to collect
      outcome data on service utilization, knowledge, attitudes, and other measures. Data analyses
      will focus on identifying changes in students' behaviors, knowledge, and attitudes toward
      mental illnesses that can be attributed to the MHFA training. In addition to testing a novel
      and timely mental health intervention for college students, this project will result in
      improved data collection measures for college populations, and will lay the foundation for
      stronger connections and future collaborations between diverse campus communities. If the
      MHFA program is successful in reducing stigma and increasing general on-campus awareness and
      early treatment of emerging mental health problems, then it may provide a cost-effective
      means for enabling more students to seek early treatments for developing mental health
      problems.

NCT02023567,The Establishment of the Objective Diagnostic Markers and Personalized Medical Intervention in Patients With Major Depressive Disorders (MDD),"
      Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most common psychiatric disorders, with high
      recurrence rate, suicide rate and disability rate. It's reported that the global burden
      caused by MDD will be up to the second rank among all the disease burdens by 2020. China is
      also confronted with the daunting challenges against MDD. It's assessed that the monthly
      incidence of MDD is 6.1%, non-hospitalizing rate reaches up to 92% and the non-treatment
      rate is approximate 95%. However, to date, the pathogenesis of MDD is obscure and the
      current therapies don't work well. Therefore, it's urgent and critical to elucidate the
      pathogenesis of MDD, to develop early diagnostic criteria and effective intervention in MDD.
      Considering the diversity of weights on genetic factor and environmental factor in MDD, in
      this project, the investigators aim firstly to explore the effect of ""genetic-environmental
      interaction""on the pathogeny of MDD for classifying MDD into ""genetic type"", ""environmental
      type"" and ""others"" based on a case-control study. We next conduct the neurobiological,
      electrophysiological, neurocognitive and psycho-behavioral assessments among MDD,
      schizophrenia and healthy groups to screen the salient endophenotypes for establishing the
      diagnostic models of different MDD subtypes. The investigators further analyse the changes
      of these indicators after 8 weeks'medication or 8 times' MECT to select the potential
      predictors for therapeutic evaluations and interventional options in different subtype MDD.
      Finally, the investigators continue a 2-year follow-up study to test and verify the
      predictors of prognosis in different subtype MDD.

NCT02185612,The EARN-Health Trial of Financial Savings and Health,"
      The current literature in social epidemiology and public health suggests that low financial
      savings has an unsurprising negative relationship with subjective well-being, and increases
      the odds of making visits to a healthcare provider, receiving a chronic disease diagnosis,
      and experiencing medical disability. Earn.org is a community-based non-profit based in San
      Francisco with a mission to help low-income workers build lifelong savings habits and
      financial capability. The organization is one of the largest providers of ""goal-based
      savings accounts"" or ""matched savings accounts"" in the US. The investigators propose to
      conduct a randomized controlled trial to determine the health effects of Earn's savings
      program. Through this trial, the investigators will test three principal hypotheses: (1)
      Participants in the Earn account, as compared to a control group, are hypothesized to
      demonstrate improved scores on mental health scales assessing depression and anxiety.

      (2) Participants in the Earn account, as compared to a control group, are hypothesized to
      experience lower odds of harmful behaviors associated with stress, specifically tobacco and
      alcohol abuse. The investigators hypothesize that the effect on behaviors will be of smaller
      effect size, and more delayed, than the effect on mental health outcomes, judging from
      similar effects observed in the micro-credit literature.

NCT02204176,Exercise Behavior Among Young Adults Study,"
      The rate of adult obesity in the United States has increased more than two times since 1970,
      and the rate of child-teen obesity has increased by four times. One of the antecedents of
      obesity is an inactive lifestyle. Exercise has been known to be associated with increases in
      both physical and mental health by increasing longevity, preventing risk of obesity,
      coronary heart disease, and hypertension, and increasing self-esteem and overall quality of
      life. The broad aim of the current study is to investigate the effectiveness of
      psychoeducational training to increase exercise activity initiation and maintenance in young
      adults.

      The goal of this study is to compare three training approaches for college students to
      increase exercise behavior. One approach provides general information on the different types
      of exercises and benefits of engaging in exercise behavior after an initial questionnaire
      assessment session. A second approach includes the general exercise information and
      questionnaire assessment as well as training on how to create specific goal intentions
      (i.e., implementation intentions) to aid in exercise initiation. A third approach uses all
      the components of the second approach but also tests the utility of a personality-informed
      module by incorporating concepts from the theory of learned industriousness. It is expected
      that the third approach will be the most effective in helping participants initiate and
      maintain their exercise activities during the course of the study duration.

      Depression affects 350 million people worldwide. In the light of the global disease burden
      statistics, the efficacy of current treatments for depression appears insufficient. Thus,
      research on novel treatment interventions and predictors for good treatment response are
      warranted. Earlier prospective follow-up studies and intervention studies suggest that
      several bio-psychosocial factors, including high serum concentrations of vitamin D, are
      related to better treatment outcomes. In this follow-up study with randomized clinical
      vitamin D supplementation trial on patients with depression, the investigators aim to

        1. clarify how a six-month intervention with vitamin D supplementation affects treatment
           response, recovery, and the biological pathways related to depression. This aims to
           finding potential sub-groups getting benefits from vitamin D supplementation. In

      and when family and caregivers are included almost everyone is affected.

      A systematic review (2014) concluded that physical activity has a significant potential for
      reducing depressive symptoms in people with a mental illness. Globally, physical inactivity
      is ""pandemic"". Current guidelines recommend a minimum of only a 150 minutes a week of
      moderately vigorous exercise but 85% of Canadians do not meet the national recommendations.
      How then can people with depression be motivated to become physically more active?

      Group Medical Visits (GMVs) can be used to provide health services and they have proven

      Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a soluble 34-46 kD angiogenic heparin-binding
      glycoprotein. This cytokine regulates multiple endothelial cell functions including vascular
      permeability and vascular tone and some data suggest that it may contribute to the
      atherosclerotic process. Recent studies have shown increased plasma and serum concentrations
      of Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in patients with OSA and there were
      correlations between VEGF concentrations and the severity of OSA, as indexed by the minimum
      oxygen saturation level and the frequency of the upper airway obstruction per hour of sleep.
      A recent non-randomized study with a small sample size has shown a significant decrease in
      Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) concentrations in patients in whom nocturnal
      hypoxia improved after 1 year of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy.

      Despite robust evidence showing improvement of symptoms, cognitive function and quality of
      life in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients treated with nasal CPAP, there are
      nevertheless conflicting data whether Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) can reduce
      daytime blood pressure (BP) in patients with OSA. Two randomized placebo controlled studies
      have shown reduction of 24-hr systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) in obstructive
      sleep apnea (OSA) patients after 1 month of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)
      therapy while other investigators have shown no such benefit.

      This randomized, sham-placebo controlled study aims to assess 1) the effect of nasal
      continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) over a period of 3 months on 24 hr blood pressure
      (BP); and 2) whether any change in BP and plasma Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
      is related to the baseline severity of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and continuous positive
      airway pressure (CPAP) compliance.

      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a serious sleep disorder in which a person repeatedly stops
      breathing, or experiences shallow breathing for short periods of time during sleep. Daytime
      sleepiness is a common symptom of OSA and may affect an individual's level of alertness
      throughout the day. The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the relationship
      between the severity of sleep-disordered breathing and levels of daytime alertness at
      baseline (untreated state) in a group of subjects with and without sleep apnea. In addition
      the change in daytime sleepiness in subjects with sleep apnea being treated with a
      continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine, a common treatment for OSA will also be

      Patients with Parkinson's disease represent a significant proportion of VA elderly patients.
      Sleep disturbances and caregiver burnout association with this condition represent a
      significant problem. In this study, the investigators propose to perform an evaluation of a
      fixed doe of ramelteon on sleep in VA outpatients diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.

      The hypothesis to be examined is that ramelteon will improve the quality of sleep in
      patients with Parkinson's disease while indirectly improving the quality of life for the
      patients and caregivers. The investigators further hypothesize that these changes will occur
      through restructuring and normalization of the sleep architecture.

NCT00691080,Treatment of Sleep Problems in Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder With Melatonin,"
      The investigators will examine whether sleep problems in children with autism spectrum
      disorder (ASD) are related to alterations in the production of melatonin (MT), a hormone
      that plays an important role in regulating sleep-wake cycle. Furthermore, the investigators
      will examine whether MT is effective in improving sleep in children with ASD. Children with
      ASD experience high rates of sleep disturbances that potentially contribute to problems with
      thinking and behavior. It is unclear if changes in MT production cause sleep problems in
      children with ASD. MT is frequently used to treat these sleep problems; however, it has not
      been well established whether MT is an effective treatment. Our hypotheses concerning MT
      are: 1. Children with ASD and sleep problems will have a delayed sleep-wake cycle and/or
      decreased MT production; 2. Treatment with MT will be associated with improved sleep and
      behavior. All subjects will be recruited from one of three sites: Baylor College of
      Medicine, Oregon Health & Science University and Columbia University. The investigators will
      use a standardized questionnaire to determine whether the child has sleep problems. The
      investigators will measure MT levels in saliva in ASD children with sleep problems and in a
      group of ASD children without sleep problems. Total 24-hour MT production will be determined
      from urine samples in these same two groups. Eligible participants will then be enrolled in
      a randomized trial of three oral doses of MT (3, 6, 9 mg) and a placebo. Neither children
      nor investigators will know which doses are being given to which participants. The
      investigators will determine whether treatment with MT helps children fall asleep faster and
      whether their behavior improves, as reported on standardized questionnaires. Results from
      this study will inform the development of future trials of sleep-wake interventions and
      clinical guidelines for the use of MT to manage sleep problems in ASD.

NCT00832026,Trans Nasal Insuflation for the Treatment of Snoring,"
      This research is being done to examine if a nasal cannula can be used to keep the throat
      open during sleep, thereby treating sleep apnea.

      People with sleep apnea and people who snore without sleep apnea may take part in this
      study. Sleep apnea is a disorder caused by pauses in breathing due to repetitive closure of
      the throat. The most common form of treatment for sleep apnea is continuous positive airway
      pressure (CPAP) therapy. While CPAP therapy remains the simplest and most effective
      treatment for snoring and sleep apnea, patients have to wear a nasal mask throughout the
      night. For this reason, patients often have difficulty sticking to therapy.

      Participants enrolled in this study will spend 3-nights in a sleep laboratory. In all
      nights, the investigators will monitor your sleep and your breathing throughout the night.
      The investigators will apply several electrodes (sensors) to your scalp and face to monitor
      your sleep and breathing, and other sensors to your chest, abdomen, cheek, and a finger to
      monitor your breathing and oxygen level.

NCT00859690,Regulation of Vascular Thrombosis in Sleep Apnea,"
      Sleep Apnea is a prevalent condition that has been increasingly diagnosed in the adult
      population and is now considered an independent risk factor for the development of
      cardiovascular disease. A better understanding of the mechanisms associated with the
      development of cardiovascular disease in sleep apnea is needed.

      This research will investigate the function of the adenosine deaminase (ADA) in subjects
      with sleep disorders. This enzyme is responsible for metabolizing adenosine, a
      neuromodulator that is released during periods of sleep apnea and that has been found to
      promote vascular thrombosis. There are multiple types of ADA that are genetically determined
      and have different levels of function. Those different forms of this enzyme may determine
      groups that are more susceptible to the development of thrombosis. Given the known
      association between sleep apnea and thrombosis, this study will determine if polymorphisms
      of this enzyme are differentially found in subjects with sleep apnea as compared to other
      sleep disturbances. The overall objective of this experiment is to assess the presence of

      Survivors of pediatric brain tumors are noted to have increased rates of excessive daytime
      sleepiness. However, very little data are available regarding the specific sleep
      disturbances of pediatric brain tumor survivors. Children ages 8 to 18 years of age who are
      at least 5 years from diagnosis and at least 2 years post treatment or observation only for
      a brain tumor will be targeted to assess the prevalence of sleep complaints.

      The study focuses on the following objectives:

        -  To estimate sleep disturbance in a cohort of pediatric brain tumor survivors.

        -  Estimate the rates of parent- and self-reported excessive daytime sleepiness in
           pediatric brain tumors

        -  Estimate the rates of parent-reported sleep-disordered breathing, including snoring and

NCT01301989,Reducing Sleep Disparities in Minority Children,"
      Inadequate sleep is a major health problem of childhood that often fails to receive
      attention until significant neurobehavioral and other health problems are noted. Although
      adequate sleep is essential for normal growth and brain development, studies show that
      children from minority and economically disadvantaged families are more likely to experience
      shorter sleep times and more sleep fragmentation compared to their Caucasian and
      economically advantaged counterparts. As a result, they are disproportionately affected by
      the adverse health and quality of life consequences of poor sleep. There are currently no
      intervention studies to the investigators knowledge aimed at addressing sleep disparities by
      improving sleep duration and sleep hygiene in early school-aged children from minority
      populations. This study seeks to close the 'sleep gap' that exists between the sleep
      duration of minority school-aged children and that of their non-minority peers. An
      interdisciplinary team of researchers and clinicians from Columbia University's Pediatric
      Lung and Sleep Disorders Center, School of Public Health, Psychiatry Department, and two
      outpatient clinic systems affiliated with Columbia are collaborating to reduce sleep
      disparities by improving sleep duration in a group of 5-6 year old minority children. The
      primary goal of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a tailored, interactive,
      educational and behavioral intervention that utilizes trained sleep counselors to assist
      parents in improving their children's sleep hygiene and reducing risk factors for poor
      sleep, thereby increasing sleep duration over a 12-month period in a randomized controlled
      trial of children identified with sleep problems (Aim 1). The investigators will screen 375
      parents of 5-6 year old children from 5 primary care clinics to identify children with and
      without sleep problems and enroll 90 of the 375 children screened who have sleep problems in
      a randomized controlled trial of an in-home sleep intervention. Using an initial home
      assessment, baseline actigraphy data, sleep logs recorded by parents, and information
      regarding risk factors for poor sleep collected from each family during screening, the
      investigators will work with intervention parents to develop a personalized sleep plan for
      their children. The investigators will evaluate the effect of the intervention on: a)
      nightly sleep duration; b) neurocognitive function; and c) behavioral disorders.

NCT01525160,New Markers to Measure Clotting in Patients With the Obstructive Sleep Apnoea Hypopnoea Syndrome,"
      Obstructive Sleep Apnoea Hypopnoea Syndrome(OSAHS)affects at least 4% of males and 2% of
      females.

      OSAHS is the combination of excessive daytime sleepiness, snoring and apnoeas (stopping
      breathing at night). As well as affecting tiredness, mood, concentration and quality of life
      - there is growing concern that it can increase the risk of high blood pressure, heart
      problems, strokes and thromboses (clots in the veins).

      It appears that OSAHS may affect the thickness of the blood and cause it to clot more easily
      it also causes damage to the lining of the blood vessels (endothelial injury). These effects
      seem independent of other risk factors such as obesity, smoking, family history of clots
      etc.

      The investigators are testing new biomarkers: gel point and fractal dimension developed at
      the Swansea University to measure the 'clotting' of the blood in people with OSAHS and a
      similar group of people who snore and who are sleepy but do not have OSAHS on sleep studies

      Adenotonsillectomy (AT) is the second most common surgical procedure in children. It is now
      performed more often for suspected SDB than for any other indication. However, recent

      learning or behavioral problems associated with SDB. The goals of this study are: (1) to
      assess the extent that behavior, cognition, and sleepiness in children can improve with
      Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment after AT, and (2) to identify which
      patients stand to gain most from post-operative assessment and treatment.

NCT01613131,Mirena and Estrogen for Control of Perimenopause Symptoms and Ovulation Suppression,"
      Hormonal treatment of perimenopausal women has frequently utilized oral contraceptive pills
      (OCPs). Because of their ability to suppress ovulation and establish cycle control, OCPs
      have become a popular option, and one that is FDA approved for use until menopause. However,
      use of OCPs in women in their 40's and 50's carries significant cardiovascular risks. Venous
      thromboembolism risk is 3-6 fold greater in OCP users, and the risk of myocardial infarction
      (MI) is approximately doubled in OCP users over the age of 40. This occurs at an age where
      the background population risk of MI begins to increase, such that the absolute number of
      cases rises substantially. Women with additional risk factors for cardiovascular disease
      have a much greater risk for MI (6-40-fold) in association with OCPs. There are also large
      subgroups of midlife women who are not candidates for OCP use, such a smokers and
      migraineurs. Moreover, the trend towards lower estrogen dosing with OCPs containing 20
      micrograms of ethinyl estradiol has not led to a detectable decrease in thromboembolic risk.

      Because of their increased potential risks, it is appropriate to seek alternatives to OCPs
      and to explore lower doses of hormones to relieve perimenopausal symptoms that occur prior
      to a woman's final menses. Recent evidence indicates that the hypothalamic-pituitary axis of
      reproductively aging women is more susceptible to suppression by sex steroids that
      previously believed. It is possible that hormone doses as low as 50 micrograms of
      transdermal estradiol (TDE) can suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary axis of midlife women.
      It is also tempting to speculate that the low but measurable circulating doses of
      levonorgestrel that are present when a woman uses the Mirena intrauterine system (IUS) can
      contribute to or even independently suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, and reduce the
      hormonal fluctuations that result in worsening of perimenopausal symptoms. The combination
      of low dose TDE plus Mirena may therefore confer superior symptom control as well as
      contraceptive effectiveness, at far less risk.

      destruction, heart disease, sleep apnoea, high blood pressure, diabetes, and polyps in the
      colon. To have a greater effect on long-term outcomes this disease needs to be detected
      early. By screening a 'high risk' population (sleep apnoea clinic) the investigators may be
      able to detect these patients earlier and prevent late complications of the disease. At LTHT
      the referral pathway for new referrals to the sleep apnoea clinic involves initial
      attendance to pick up a pulse oximeter to wear overnight to measure oxygen levels. These
      readings show approximately 1:4 patients displays evidence of significant obstructive sleep
      apnoea to warrant referral to the treatment group for continuous positive airway pressure
      (CPAP), weight management, and occasionally mandibular adjustment.

      Patients attending the sleep apnoea clinic either as new referral or for review will be
      asked to participate in the proposed study. The study is cross-sectional in design
      incorporating two sub-populations within the sleep apnoea clinic. The first cohort comprises

      Dysfunctional adipose tissue predisposes to cardiovascular disease. Similarly, the risk of
      cardiovascular disease appears to be increased in subjects with obstructive sleep apnoea.
      Reduced adipose tissue oxygen availability has been described in obesity and may also be a
      mechanism in obstructive sleep apnoea. Hypoxia induces inflammation and fibrosis in adipose
      tissue which are factors contributing to cardiovascular risk. The investigators hypothesize
      that adipose tissue's oxygen uptake is reduced in subjects with obstructive sleep apnoea by
      comparing in vivo AT oxygenation and blood flow in tissue of control subjects.

NCT00001912,Brain Tissue Swelling and Seizure Activity in Inactive Cysticercosis,"
      This study will examine what causes seizures in patients with cysticercosis (pork tapeworm
      infection). A better understanding of this could lead to improved methods of controlling or
      preventing seizures.

      In humans, the pork tapeworm (Taenia solium) lives in the small intestine. The parasite's
      microscopic eggs travel around the body-including to the brain-where they develop into
      cysts. Usually, the cysts don't cause symptoms until they die. Then, they provoke an
      inflammatory reaction that irritates the brain, causing seizures and other symptoms. The
      inflammation eventually goes away, but the dead cysts remain. Calcium deposits often form
      where the cysts are. Some of the calcified cysts develop swelling around them that seem to
      be associated with the development of seizures.

      This study will explore how and why these dead, calcified cysts continue to cause seizures.
      In so doing, it will try to determine: 1) the best diagnostic imaging method for detecting
      swelling around the cysts; 2) how often swelling occurs; and 3) what makes some cysts prone
      to swelling and related seizure activity, while others are not.

      Patients with cysticercosis who have had seizures or who have known or possible swelling
      around calcified cysts will be studied with various tests, including magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) scans, electroencephalography (EEG), blood tests,
      and possibly lumbar puncture. Patients will be studied for two cycles of seizures (during
      active and quiet periods) or a maximum 4 years.

NCT00172263,The Interaction Between Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Viral Proteins and Monocytes,"
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a new threat to public health since November,
      2002. The SARS is highly contagious and is believed to be transmitted by person-to-person
      through droplet and direct contact. The patients present with fever, chills, cough, myalgia,
      dyspnea, and diarrhea. The symptoms aggravate in the second week and nearly 40% of the
      patients develop respiratory failure that requires assisted ventilation. The mortality rate
      is reported as 6.5%-7%.

      After several months, the world scientists found the etiology to be a new coronavirus not
      belonging to the previous coronavirus group I, II and III. The new virus is called SARS
      associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV).

      Although the high morbidity and mortality of SARS occurred in adults, there was rare
      mortality reported in the children. The report from Hong Kong pointed out that the symptoms
      of SARS in younger children were milder and the clinical course was not as aggressive as in
      adults. Therefore, the aim of the project is to design the experiment to see the differences
      of immunological responses to SARS-CoV protein in healthy younger children, teenagers, and
      adults. The investigators hope that the result could explain the reason for milder disease
      in younger children and the immunological pathogenesis of SARS.

NCT00300417,Phase I Study of West Nile Virus Vaccine,"
      This study will test the safety of an experimental vaccine for preventing West Nile virus
      infection. The virus is spread mainly by mosquito bites. Symptoms can include high fever,
      headache, neck stiffness, stupor, muscle weakness, vision loss, numbness and paralysis.
      Rarely, infection leads to permanent nerve damage and possibly death. The vaccine used in
      the study is made from DNA that codes for West Nile virus proteins. Injected into a muscle,
      the DNA instructs the body to make a small amount of West Nile virus protein. This study
      will see if the body creates resistance or immunity to these proteins. Participants cannot
      get West Nile virus from the vaccine.

      Healthy normal volunteers between 18 and 65 years of age may be eligible for this study.
      Candidates are screened with a medical history, physical examination, and blood and urine
      tests for various infections and other medical problems. Women who are able to become
      pregnant are given a pregnancy test. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding may not
      participate. Anyone who has received a vaccination for Yellow Fever or Japanese Encephalitis
      virus in the past may not participate in this research study.

      Participants will receive three injections of the experimental vaccine, the first on the
      first study day (Day 0), the second on Day 28, and the third on Day 56. The injections are
      given with a device called Biojector® (Registered Trademark) 2000 that delivers the vaccine
      through the skin into the muscle without the use of a needle. On the day of each injection,
      subjects are given a diary card to take home for recording their temperature and any
      symptoms or side effects for 5 days. They return to the clinic 2 weeks after each injection,
      bringing the completed card with them at that time. In addition to the injections, subjects
      have the following tests and procedures during clinic visits:

        -  Medical history and, if needed, physical examination: Day 0 and weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10,

NCT00374309,Experimental Vaccine for Prevention of Ebola Virus Infection,"
      This study will determine if an experimental vaccine to prevent Ebola virus infection is
      safe and what side effects, if any, it causes. Ebola virus infection may range from mild to
      severe, and may cause breathing problems, severe bleeding, kidney problems and shock that
      can lead to death. The vaccine used in this study contains man-made genetic material similar
      to one part of the Ebola virus, which is designed to stimulate an immune response to the
      virus. The vaccine itself cannot cause Ebola virus infection because it does not contain any
      Ebola virus.

      Participants are assigned to one of three groups as they enter into the study. Of the first
      16 people in the study, 12 receive the lowest study dose of vaccine and 4 receive placebo
      (an inactive substance). If this dose is safe, then of the next 16 people who enter the
      study, 12 receive a higher dose of the vaccine, and the remaining 4 receive placebo. If this
      dose is safe, the final 12 people in the last group of 16 receive the highest study dose,
      and 4 receive placebo. The vaccine is given as a single injection in the arm on the day of
      enrollment.

      Participants keep a diary for 5 days, recording their temperature, symptoms and any reaction
      at the injection site. They call a study nurse the day after vaccination to report how they
      feel, and they return to the clinic approximately six times for follow-up evaluations. These
      visits may include a check of vital signs, physical examination, blood and urine tests, or

      will be randomized to receive either a single dose of PCV13 or 2 doses 2 months apart.
      Serotype-specific serum IgG and OPA will be measured pre-dose 1 and again 3 months later.
      Children 2 to 4 years of age will receive a single dose of PCV13 and have IgG and OPA
      assessments pre-vaccination and 1 month post-vaccination.

      The immunogenicity and reactogenicity of PCV13 in the ""standard schedule"" groups (e.g. 6,
      10, 14 weeks for infants and single dose for toddlers) will be compared to that observed in
      the PCV13 licensure trials. Within each age group the alternative schedule will be compared
      to the standard schedule in terms of immunogenicity and impact on nasopharyngeal carriage
      (infants only).

NCT01618175,Home Oxygen Treatment of Childhood Acute Bronchiolitis,"
      Background: acute bronchiolitis (AB) is a common reason for hospitalization of infants in
      all population groups, and is usually due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection.
      The main cause for hospitalization is often a need for oxygen, but can also include high
      fever (with a suspected secondary bacterial infection) or increasing respiratory distress.
      In a minority of cases (some of which can be identified in advance by defining risk groups)
      a serious illness may develop, including risk of respiratory failure and death. Most cases
      will just require supplemental oxygen and suction of secretions from the nose (as listed in
      the recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics - AAP). However, this apparently
      ""simple"" treatment still requires continued hospitalization. This results in a sharp
      increase in bed occupancy in Israeli hospital pediatric departments in the winter months. In
      recent years two studies from developed countries have been published where safety has been
      demonstrated for home oxygen treatment for babies with AB. However, feasibility studies have
      not been published yet, for example for populations living in poor conditions. The General
      Health Services (Klalit) in Israel provides integrated hospital and community health service
      to the majority of the population living o in our region, thus presenting an opportunity for
      optimal interventions related to this disease.

      Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a fatal, recessive genetic disorder characterized by progressive
      inflammation and lung damage. It is unclear whether current treatment strategies, which
      focus on detection and eradication of pathogenic microorganisms in the lung, are the best
      way to prevent the initiation of early inflammation and lung damage. This study asks how
      early acquisition of microbial flora occurs in infants with CF and healthy baby controls,
      and whether this process initiates or influences early inflammation and clinical disease
      progression in CF.

NCT01766830,"Rapid Diagnostic Tests and Clinical/Laboratory Predictors of Tropical Diseases In Patients With Persistent Fever in Cambodia, Nepal, Democratic Republic of the Congo and Sudan (NIDIAG-Fever)","
      Tropical fevers have been a diagnostic challenge from the antiquity. Nowadays, despite the
      availability of good diagnostic capacities, undifferentiated febrile illnesses continue to
      be a thorny problem for travel physicians. In developing countries, the scarcity of skilled
      personnel and adequate laboratory facilities makes the differential diagnosis of fevers even
      more complex. Health care workers must often rely on syndrome-oriented empirical approaches
      to treatment and might overestimate or underestimate the likelihood of certain diseases. For
      instance Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTD) contribute substantially to the burden of
      persistent (more than 1 week) fevers in the Tropics, causing considerable mortality and
      major disability. These diseases are however rarely diagnosed at primary health care (PHC)
      level. The difficulty in establishing the cause of febrile illnesses has resulted in
      omission or delays in treatment, irrational prescriptions with polytherapy, increasing cost
      and development of drug resistance.

      In resource-limited settings, clinical algorithms constitute a valuable aid to health
      workers, as they facilitate the therapeutic decision in the absence of good laboratory
      capacities. There is a critical lack of appropriate diagnostic tools to guide treatment of
      NTDs. While clinical algorithms have been developed for some NTDs, in most cases they remain
      empirical. Besides, they rarely take into account local prevalence data, do not adequately
      represent the spectrum of patients and differential diagnosis at the primary care level and
      often have not been properly validated. The purpose of the study is to develop
      evidence-based Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT)-supported diagnostic guidelines for patients with
      persistent fever (≥ 1 week) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Sudan, Cambodia
      and Nepal.

      The study evaluates the efficacy of fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium bromide/vilanterol
      (FF/UMEC/VI) to reduce the annual rate of moderate and severe exacerbations compared with
      dual therapy of FF/VI or UMEC/VI in subjects with COPD. Published studies which assessed the
      use of an 'open' triple therapy (use of Inhaled Corticosteroid [ICS]/ Long-acting Muscarinic
      Receptor Antagonists [LAMA])/ Long Acting Beta-Agonist [LABA] delivered via multiple
      inhalers) in moderate-severe COPD patients, reported improvements in lung function, Health
      Related Quality of Life (HRQoL), hospitalization rates and rescue medication use, compared
      to dual therapy (ICS/LABA) or LAMA alone. These studies have also shown similar safety
      profile with dual or monotherapy doses for periods of up to one year. Given the clinical
      experience with FF, UMEC and VI, and that the associated risks with these compounds are
      anticipated from their known pharmacology, the potential benefit of a new therapy option in
      patients with moderate to severe COPD supports the further development of the closed triple

      This study seeks to determine the incidence and transmission of avian influenza viruses in
      humans exposed to poultry. Enrolled subjects will be selected from five different rural
      areas (villages) in the Nile delta region in Egypt where poultry are commonly raised. From
      those study sites, 2400 healthy subjects will be monitored for 6 years with annual follow up
      visits to measure sero-prevalence and exposure variables, and more importantly, biweekly or
      weekly visits to measure incidence of infection, measure secondary transmission rates,
      monitor symptoms, and assess immunological response.

      Primary Objectives:

        -  To estimate the incidence of avian influenza (AI) in poultry-exposed human populations.

        -  To estimate sero-prevalent of AI in poultry-exposed human populations.

        -  To investigate potential risk factors associated with AI human infections in
           poultry-exposed individuals.

        -  To investigate secondary infection risk for household contacts.

NCT02459327,Integrated Model for Promoting Parenting and Early School Readiness in Pediatrics,"
      This study tests a comprehensive approach to the promotion of school readiness in low-income
      families, beginning shortly after the birth of the child, through enhancement of positive
      parenting practices (and when present, reduction of psychosocial stressors) within the
      pediatric primary care platform. The investigators do so by integrating two evidence-based
      interventions: 1) a universal primary prevention strategy (Video Interaction Project [VIP]);
      and 2) a targeted secondary/tertiary prevention strategy (Family Check-up [FCU]) for
      families with infants/toddlers identified as having additional risks. VIP provides parents
      with a developmental specialist who videotapes the parent and child and coaches the parent
      on effective parenting practices at each pediatric primary care visit. FCU is a home-based,
      family-centered intervention that utilizes an initial ecologically-focused assessment to
      promote motivation for parents to change child-rearing behaviors, with follow-up sessions on
      parenting and factors that compromise parenting quality.

      Two primary care settings serving low-income communities in New York City, NY and
      Pittsburgh, PA will be utilized to test this integrated intervention in hospital-based
      clinics, providing information about translation across venues where one of the two
      interventions has been previously used alone.

      The investigators plan to test the VIP/FCU model in a randomized trial of 400 families
      utilizing parent surveys, observational data on parent-child interactions, and direct
      assessments of children's development, at key points during intervention follow-up. Analyses
      will address questions of program impact for the integrated program across all families and
      by key subgroups.

      The largest single contribution made by this study is to test whether an integrated primary
      and secondary/tertiary prevention strategy implemented in pediatric primary care can produce
      impacts on early school readiness outcomes, including social-emotional, pre-academic, and
      self-regulation. As such, this study has the potential to provide the scientific and
      practice communities with information about an innovative approach to promoting school
      readiness skills among low-income children.

      High fidelity simulations provide a unique opportunity for teaching and evaluation of
      knowledge, clinical reasoning, decision making and teamwork. We have developed a series of
      novel cardiac based simulations that review difficult learning objectives of cardiac
      anesthesiology rotation. We hypothesized that residents who have completed a rotation in
      cardiac anesthesiology will perceive these simulations to be both mentally challenging and a
      useful tool in preparing them for their subsequent clinical experience and for their
      anesthesiology board. For the first time, we have used the NASA Task Load Index Scale in
      evaluating Neuro Cognitive Workload during Cardiac Anesthesia Based simulation scenarios
      .Residents who have completed the cardiac rotation at least once would be assigned the task
      in small groups either a group of 2 or group of 3.The module consists of 3 different
      scenarios. The scenarios include, weaning the patient off of cardio pulmonary bypass,
      management of severe protamine drug reaction and acute hypotension from malfunction of the
      coronary graft in a simulated operating room in real time.

NCT02612896,Taenia Solium Elimination Versus Control: What is the Best Way Forward for Sub-Saharan Africa?,"
      Taenia solium taeniosis/cysticercosis is a neglected zoonotic parasitic disease complex with
      significant economic and public health impacts, occurring primarily in developing countries.
      Humans are the carriers of the tapeworm (taeniosis); the normal intermediate pig host
      develops the metacestode larval stage (porcine cysticercosis). However, people can also act
      as accidental intermediate hosts and develop human cysticercosis or neurocysticercosis (NCC)
      when the central nervous system is involved.

      The scattered efforts of researchers into evaluation of control programmes in Sub-Saharan
      Africa (SSA) have focussed on single control options. It is becoming clear that these
      stand-alone options have the potential to reduce the occurrence of the parasite, however
      either long term or more integrated efforts seem to be required to reach an elimination
      status.

      The objective of the current study is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness/acceptability of
      elimination (to be achieved on a short term via integrated measures), and control (single
      measures, with an elimination goal on a longer term) of T. solium in a highly endemic area
      in SSA.

      This intervention study will entail an elimination study arm in which multiple control
      options are combined (integrated) aiming at the final human host (Mass drug administration
      (MDA) and health education) and pig intermediate hosts (pig treatment and vaccination). In a
      second study arm a single control option will be carried out (pig treatment). In both study
      arms (health) education will be implemented. At baseline and in the final sampling year,
      prevalence of human taeniosis/cysticercosis and porcine cysticercosis will be determined in
      all study villages. Active ongoing surveillance and 6 monthly (biannual) human and pig
      sampling will be conducted in the elimination study arm, as well as two-yearly (biennial)
      sampling of the pig intermediate host in the control study arm. Additionally, (open ended)
      questionnaires and focus group discussions will be administered/held to obtain data on the
      cost of pig keeping, T. solium, the interventions and the perception/acceptability of the
      proposed control measures to the local communities.
