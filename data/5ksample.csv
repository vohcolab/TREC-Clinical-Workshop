NCT01001247,TMC278-TiDP6-C154: Evaluation of the Possible Influence of Omeprazole Intake - and the pH Increase in the Stomach Triggered by Omeprazole Intake - on the Blood Levels of TMC278 in Healthy Volunteers,"
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the extent by which intake of 20 mg once daily
      (q.d.) omeprazole influences the levels of TMC278 in the blood after intake of 25 mg q.d..
      This study also investigates - in case levels of TMC278 are reduced when co-administered with
      omeprazole - whether a double dose of TMC278 (50 mg q.d.) or a separation of intake of both
      drugs by 12 hours may circumvent a decrease of TMC278 levels in the blood below the clinical
      effective concentration. Omeprazole is prescribed to reduce the production of gastric acid.
      Since TMC278 requires gastric acid to be properly dissolved and taken up in the blood
      circulation, intake of omeprazole has an influence on the levels of TMC278 in the blood
      circulation. This effect has been revealed in a previously conducted clinical trial, using
      the combination of 150 mg TMC278 q.d. and 20 mg q.d. omeprazole. The currently proposed study
      will also further explore the relationship between the levels of TMC278 in the blood at
      several time points and the acidity of the stomach. Also the short-term safety and
      tolerability of co-administration of omeprazole 20 mg q.d. and TMC278 25 mg q.d. will be
      assessed.

NCT01001585,Anesthetic Effects in Mitochondrial Disease,"
      Summary. At the present, the investigators do not have the perfect anesthetic for
      mitochondrial patients. When possible, consideration should be given to the use of local
      anesthetics in small amounts. When a general anesthetic is necessary, they each carry
      significant risks and have been associated with poor outcomes. At present it is not possible
      to eliminate one group as less safe than others. What is clear is that these patients must be
      monitored more closely than other patients. The advent of the bispectral index (BIS) monitor
      may allow us to monitor their depth of anesthesia more closely and thus expose these patients
      only to the minimum amount of drug necessary to carry out the surgical procedure.

      Purpose. The investigators hypothesize that specific mitochondrial diseases, in particular
      those that decrease complex I function, make certain children hypersensitive to volatile
      anesthetics. These same patients may be at increased risk for adverse outcomes following
      general anesthesia. The specific aims of this application are:

        1. Determine which molecular defects in mitochondrial function lead to alter sensitivity to
           the VA sevoflurane.

        2. Establish the relative safety of sevoflurane in treatment of patients with mitochondrial
           disease.

      The investigators plan to monitor patients with mitochondrial disease using expanded measures
      of cardiovascular stability and measurements of brain electrical activity while slowly
      inducing general anesthesia. The investigators will use those measurements to limit the
      amount of anesthetic these patients receive in an attempt to minimize their risk. In
      addition, the investigators will correlate their sensitivity to the type of mitochondrial
      defect so that the investigators may be able to predict which patients are likely to have an
      increased sensitivity.

NCT01002157,The Effects of Vitamin K2 Supplementation on the Progression of Coronary Artery Calcification,"
      Both Coronary Artery Calcification (CAC)and its annual progression are a strong predictors of
      cardiovascular events. The development of arterial calcification results from imbalance
      between calcification promoting and inhibiting factors. An important inhibitor of
      calcification is Matrix Gla Protein (MGP): a protein present in the vascular wall where it is
      synthesized by Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells (VSMC). MGP requires Vitamin K-mediated
      carboxylation to function properly. Deficiency of Vitamin K has been demonstrated to cause
      arterial calcification and a diet containing large amounts of Vitamin K2 was associated with
      lower CAC and cardiovascular risk. In animal studies, active supplementation of Vitamin K2
      caused regression of existing arterial calcification. Therefore, the aim of this randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial is to investigate whether daily
      supplementation of Vitamin K2 (Menaquinone-7) to patients with established CAC will lead to a
      decreased progression-rate of CAC after 24 months of follow-up in comparison to placebo.

      occur when lymph vessels are damaged or lymph nodes are removed. Lymphedema can develop right
      after breast cancer treatment or weeks, months, or even years later. For many people,
      available treatments for lymphedema are not effective. Recent evidence suggests that
      acupuncture may help reduce the symptoms of lymphedema. The purpose of this study is to

      these patients. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been shown effective in reducing
      stress, anxiety and pain in rheumatoid arthritis and fibromyalgia. The purpose of the present
      trial was to assess whether CBT may reduce pain and other symptoms and increase well-being
      and general function, affect biological markers for pain and long-term stress, to a larger
      extent than treatment ""as usual"".

      Forty eight women with verified fibromyalgia were randomly allocated to an early treatment

NCT01004627,A Study of Routine Versus Selective Use of Ultrasound Scanning Prior to Haemodialysis Fistula Surgery,"
      Dialysis patients have their blood filtered by a machine as their kidneys no longer work. To
      get blood in and out of these patients it is possible to perform a surgical procedure to
      increase to size and durability of a vein in the arm to allow repeated needle insertion. This
      enlarged vein is called a fistula. There is some evidence that ultrasound scanning the blood
      vessels in the arm before surgery can improve the chances of a successful procedure. The
      investigators aim to test whether scanning all patients is better than scanning only those
      who are difficult to assess by physical examination alone.

NCT01005394,Navigated Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in Monitoring Stroke Recovery,"
      The past 10 years of research in persons more than 6 months post stroke have shown certain
      types of rehabilitation can help ""re-wire"" the brain. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)
      can be used to monitor this re-wiring by mapping the brain's function (measuring brain
      activity). Recent research suggests that TMS can be used for both prognosis (determining
      future function) and to determine what type of rehabilitation therapy will work best after
      stroke. The purposes of this research study are to: 1) determine changes in brain activity
      during the first 6 months after stroke (to determine how the brain ""re-wires""); 2) compare
      changes in recovery of motor function with changes in brain re-wiring; 3) determine the
      ability of TMS to ""predict"" functional outcome in the first 6 months after stroke.

      The primary hypotheses are: 1) functional recovery will be correlated with TMS changes (as
      measure motor threshold (MT), motor evoked potentials (MEPs) and recruitment curves; 2)
      baseline TMS will predict future functional outcomes at 3 and 6 months.

NCT01006330,Dysphagia in Elderly Medical Patients,"
      Dysphagia in hospitalized elders is associated with less positive outcomes in rehabilitation,
      increased likelihood of readmission, increased comorbidity and mortality, and increased
      length of hospital stay. In light of an increase in the elderly population in Denmark, the
      consequences of dysphagia, and the importance of minimizing the risk of disability and
      frailty, it is vital to emphasize safe participation of the elderly dysphagic patient in
      eating, drinking and swallowing. Danish occupational therapists have an important role in the
      dysphagia management, but no Danish evidence-based occupational therapy assessments for
      dysphagia of elderly medical patients exist. In order to oblige this lack, the objective of
      the study is to provide an assessment tool with operational definitions of dysphagia which
      includes the complexity of performance in eating, drinking and swallowing, is evidence-based,
      and guides occupational therapists in the treatment planning in a client-centred and
      purposeful manner.

      The study involves a quantitative approach, and is initiated by a translation and cultural
      adaptation of the Canadian ""The McGill Ingestive Skills Assessment"" (MISA). Hereafter, the
      psychometric qualities are tested. On basis of the data collected for the psychometrics, the
      prevalence and characteristics of dysphagia in the study population are investigated.
      Provided that the psychometric testing of the MISA reveals satisfactory levels, the effect of
      using the MISA in the treatment planning is investigated.

      It is hypothesized that:

      The Danish translation of the MISA will demonstrates satisfactory content validity,
      reliabilities, convergent validity, known-groups validity, predictive validity, criterion
      validity, high levels of sensitivity/specificity and are responsive to change.

      Dysphagia is prevalent in elderly medical patients at the time of admission to acute medical
      care and there can be found a correlation between dysphagia severity and the presence of
      comorbidity, disability, frailty, the length of hospital stay, the place of discharge and the
      number of readmissions for elderly medical patients.

NCT01008228,Comparison of Exsufflation Versus Drainage in Primary Spontaneous Pneumothorax,"
      Management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) remains unclear. Primary therapeutic
      goals for PSP include removal of air from the pleural space an prevention of recurrences. The
      absence of generally accepted and methodologically sound recommendations may account for the
      extensive variation in practice for air evacuation techniques. Air evacuation may be achieved
      by simple aspiration (exsufflation) or conventional chest tube drainage. Chest tube
      thoracotomy remains the most popular technique.Aspiration is a more simple technique, that
      allows possibility of ambulatory management. The purpose of the present study is to compare

      This phase II trial studies autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant followed by
      donor bone marrow transplant in treating patients with high-risk Hodgkin lymphoma,

NCT01009788,ABT-888 and Temozolomide for Metastatic Breast Cancer and BRCA1/2 Breast Cancer,"
      The purpose of this research study is to find out if the combination of ABT-888 and
      temozolomide is safe and effective in treating patients with metastatic breast cancer.
      ABT-888 works by obstructing a DNA enzyme called poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) which
      helps repair cancer cells damaged by chemotherapy. By blocking the PARP enzyme, the cancer
      cells are unable to repair themselves and as a result die. The other drug in this study is
      temozolomide. Temozolomide is designed to damage DNA in order to prevent cancer cells from
      reproducing. Because PARP inhibitors, such as ABT-888, prevent cancer cells from repairing
      their own DNA, they enhance the potential of chemotherapy therapy like temozolomide to induce
      cell death. The combination of ABT-888 and temozolomide has been used in a clinical trial for
      treatment of other cancers and information for this research study suggests that the
      combination may help to inhibit growth in breast cancer.

NCT01000428,The Role of Positron Emission Tomography (PET) During Erlotinib Treatment for Non-small Cell Lung Cancer,"
      Erlotinib is an inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase.
      Higher response rates were observed in a subset of patients with female gender, Asian
      ethnicity, no smoking history, mutations in EGFR tyrosine kinase, high EGFR gene copy number
      and adenocarcinoma histology. However, the therapeutic effect of Erlotinib is not confined to
      patients whose tumors harbor EGFR mutations and other predictors of efficacy of this agent.
      And these tests require time and sufficiently large specimens for processing, whereas many
      patients with advanced NSCLC are diagnosed based on cytology alone.

      This study was designed to evaluate FLT-PET or FDG-PET usefulness in the early assessment of
      treatment response and in predicting patient outcome after erlotinib monotherapy for patients
      with non-small cell lung cancer prospectively. Changes in tumor FLT or FDG uptake 7 days

NCT01000038,"Wii-fit for Activity, Balance and Gait in Assisted Living","
      Purpose of the study: Falls in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) are common and lead to fractures,
      acute hospitalizations and increased rate of institutionalization. Poor balance and gait
      abnormalities, commonly associated with AD, are risk factors for falls. Improving balance and
      gait abnormalities is critical to prevent falls in AD.

      Exercise interventions improve gait and balance in elderly. Walking is the most commonly
      recommended home-based exercise program for elderly by primary care providers. However, it is
      difficult to engage patients with AD in long term exercise programs. Barriers to exercise
      programs include lack of motivation, poor engagement, and external factors such as the cost
      of physical therapy (PT). Use of readily available technology might bridge this gap by
      providing high level of engagement via use of multimedia at an affordable price.

      Wii-Fit is a Nintendo gaming console used for aerobics, strength training, and balance
      activities. This device includes a balance board that senses weight, movement and balance.
      Wii-Fit is a TV based self-directed activity not limited by the constraint of a therapist's
      presence. Virtual trainers talk the user through the activity while tracking progress.
      Furthermore, visual and auditory feedback improves engagement. Some skilled nursing
      facilities have started using the Wii-Fit as an adjunct to PT, and note improvement in
      balance along with social benefits but no systematic studies are done to generalize the
      findings.

      The investigators propose an 8 week prospective randomized study with the treatment group
      receiving the exercise program delivered by Wii-Fit system and the comparison arm receiving a
      walking exercise program.

NCT01000935,Impact of Autologous Platelet Rich Plasma on Healing of Rotator Cuff Repairs,"
      Partial-thickness and full-thickness rotator cuff tears are common soft-tissue conditions
      that often require surgical treatment. Initial efforts to improve tendon healing centered on
      improving the strength of the repair construct. More recent studies have focused on biologic
      enhancement of the healing process. The use of platelet concentrates to improve healing, has
      been explored considerably during the last decade. Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) is a fraction
      of plasma that has been isolated and used to enhance regeneration in bone and soft tissues.

      There is information on use of PRP in oral surgery, achilles tendon healing, limb lengthening
      procedures, chronic elbow tendinosis, ruptures/degenerative changes in the patellar tendon,
      and osteoarthritis of the knee. There are no randomized clinical trials to our knowledge that
      have examined the impact of PRP in patients with rotator cuff tear.

      The objective of the proposed pilot study is to examine the effectiveness of autologous
      Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) application in promoting healing of the rotator cuff (RC) tendons
      following arthroscopic rotator cuff repair through a randomized controlled study.

      To this end the effect of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, the selective COX-2
      inhibitor etoricoxib, will be evaluated in the allergen challenge setting in twelve subjects
      with intermittent allergic asthma. Active treatment for 10 to 13 days will be compared with

NCT01003379,TC-5619 as Augmentation Therapy to Improve Cognition in Outpatients With Cognitive Dysfunction in Schizophrenia,"
      Schizophrenia affects approximately 1% of the population worldwide, and in about 80% of
      cases, it is a lifelong, disabling illness. It is a multi-dimensional disease that is
      associated with symptoms that have been characterized as positive, negative, and cognitive.
      CDS is a core feature of schizophrenia, and most individuals with schizophrenia exhibit
      cognitive impairment. Attention disorders, slow information processing, working memory
      disorders, and lack of flexibility for adaptive strategies are symptoms of cognitive
      impairment that have a devastating impact on the function, employment, and social status of
      patients with schizophrenia.

      Older typical neuroleptic medications (e.g., haloperidol, fluphenazine) do not improve
      cognition. In fact, haloperidol has been shown to induce cognitive impairment in
      schizophrenic patients.

      Novel atypical antipsychotics, such as risperidone, clozapine, and olanzapine, seem to
      produce gains in cognition. This improvement may reflect a diminution of extrapyramidal side
      effects of the typical high potency neuroleptics. Alternatively, it might reflect more

NCT01004120,Efficacy of a Prebiotic Galactooligosaccharide to Reduce Metabolic Syndrome Risk Factors in Overweight Adults,"
      The traditional risk factors for obesity are inappropriate diet, lack of exercise and genetic
      factors. However, recent observations have involved gut microbiota profiles as having an
      additional influence. In this case, there exists the possibility to modulate this through
      diet. Research has shown that the gut microbiota of both obese humans and mouse models of
      obesity is altered towards less beneficial one compared to lean counterparts. This raises the
      possibility of modulating the gut microbiota as a novel strategy in tackling the epidemic of
      obesity and diabetes sweeping the developed world. In addition, a more direct effect of
      high-fat induced disruption of the intestinal microbiota has also been seen with a murine
      model. Elevated circulating levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) a major building block and
      antigen of Gram-negative bacteria, was shown to generate a low grade chronic inflammation,
      termed metabolic endotoxemia, which then onsets insulin resistance. High-fat diets were shown
      to disrupt the Gram-negative intestinal populations of these animals, liberating LPS. The
      effects of prebiotics on the microbiota or metabolic syndrome (combination of disorders that
      increase the risk of developing cardiovascular disease and diabetes) in overweight adults
      have not been investigated thus far. The investigators therefore propose to investigate the
      effect of galactooligosaccharide (GOS) on the faecal microbiota and metabolic syndrome risk
      factors in overweight adults in a double-blind, randomised, placebo controlled, cross-over
      trial.

NCT01004328,Using Health Information Technology (HIT) to Improve Transitions of Complex Elderly Patients From Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) to Home,"
      The incidence of drug-induced injury is high in the ambulatory geriatric population,
      especially for elders with complex healthcare needs during high risk transitions to the
      ambulatory setting. In a previous study funded by the National Institute on Aging and the
      Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality [AHRQ] (AG 15979), the investigators determined
      that drug-related injuries occur at a rate of more than 50 per 1000-patient years in older
      adults in the ambulatory setting and that 28% are preventable. Independent risk factors for
      adverse drug events among older adults in the ambulatory setting included advanced age,
      multiple comorbid conditions, and the use of medications requiring close monitoring. In this
      project, Using HIT to Improve Transitions of Complex Elderly Patients from SNF to Home (1 R18
      HS017817), the investigators are testing the use of an electronic medical record (EMR)-based
      transitional care intervention for complex elderly patients transitioning from subacute care
      in a skilled nursing facility (SNF) to the ambulatory setting. The growing trend for
      physicians and other healthcare providers to restrict their practices to single settings and
      not follow complex patients as they move between settings leaves older patients discharged
      from subacute care particularly vulnerable. This transition is uniquely challenging because
      of the complex healthcare needs of this population, who often require outpatient primary care
      physicians to coordinate with visiting nurses in order to manage complex medication regimens
      and fluctuating clinical status. To facilitate high-quality transitions from the subacute to
      the ambulatory setting and support interdisciplinary communication, the investigators will
      use the EMR to assure that physicians in the ambulatory setting receive key health
      information and alerts.

NCT01004367,Health Promotion in Adolescents in Ecuador,"
      Worldwide, low-income and middle-income countries are undergoing rapid demographic and
      nutritional changes. Populations tend to move from their traditional food habits towards
      dietary patterns characterized by a more energy-dense diet, while urbanization and technology
      (work, transport) play a role in the reduction of their physical activity. This shift towards
      energy-dense diets and lower levels of physical activity are key determinants of chronic
      diseases. Nowadays, childhood overweight and obesity are becoming a major threat to public
      health all in low-income and middle-income countries. Clearly, not properly addressing this
      health problem will only aggravate the already enormous impact of chronic diseases on the
      social and economic development of these countries. This study aims to develop a culturally
      relevant school-based prevention intervention among Ecuadorian adolescents (11-13 years old)
      in Cuenca. The intervention will target behavioural nutrition and physical activity.
      Intervention strategies will be developed based on theoretical behavioural change models
      integrated in two complementary frameworks, i.e. (i) the Intervention Mapping protocol, and
      (ii) the Comprehensive Participatory Planning and Evaluation protocol.

      The study includes two phases:

        1. A formative research, which will be conducted in order to understand the causality of
           the school environment and unhealthy eating and low physical activity levels in
           school-going adolescents, aged 12-13 years old.

        2. A paired, cluster-randomized controlled trial including 1400 adolescents (12-13 years
           old) from 10 pairs of schools (i.e. clusters). Within each pair of clusters, one cluster

NCT01005732,Effectiveness of Pressure Garment Therapy After Burns,"
      Purpose - To determine the effectiveness of custom-fit pressure garment therapy in the
      prevention of hypertrophic scarring in healed burns.

      Background - Approximately one million people are burned each year in the United States. The
      most devastating outcomes following burns is the ugly, itchy, hypertrophic scar that
      interferes with work and all other aspects of life. Pressure garment therapy is routinely
      used to minimize hypertrophic scarring even though there is no scientifically valid data that
      this therapy is efficacious. Pressure garments are extremely unattractive, expensive and
      uncomfortable and their use needs to be based upon valid data.

      Goals and Objectives - The investigators plan to determine the effectiveness of pressure
      garment therapy in the control of hypertrophic scarring in healed burns.

      Methods - The I-Scan® device was designed to measure pressure at the body/environment
      interface and allows clinicians to deal with pressure-related problems for at-risk patients.
      It has been widely used in rehabilitation medicine but not with burn survivors. The
      investigators will use this device to measure the pressure at the garment/skin interface. 2)
      Furthermore, the few studies that have been attempted to determine efficacy have used between
      subjects designs. Since burn depth is extremely variable from patient to patient and since
      hypertrophic scarring is greatly influenced by age and race/origin, the between subjects
      design requires very large numbers of subjects. The investigators will use a within wounds
      design studying forearm burns and applying pressure to half of the wound and no pressure to
      the other half. The investigators will then compare hardness, color, thickness and clinical
      appearance.

      Myocardial Infarctions (MI) are commonly known as heart attacks. An ST-Segment Elevation
      Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) is a more severe type of heart attack. Myocardial Infarctions
      happen when a coronary artery is partially or fully blocked suddenly by a blood clot, causing
      damage to at least some of the heart muscle being supplied by that artery. In a STEMI, a
      blood clot completely blocks the coronary artery. This can result in damage to the heart
      muscle that is supplied by the affected artery. The purpose of the IK-1001 STEMI Study is to
      evaluate the safety and effectiveness of an investigational study drug (IK-1001). IK-1001 is
      being studied to determine if it is safe and if it can reduce the amount of damage caused to
      the heart from a STEMI. Potential subjects may be eligible if they have been diagnosed with a
      STEMI and undergo a primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI, a procedure where a
      blocked coronary artery is unblocked during a cardiac catheterization), as well as meet other

      the collection, management, analysis and reporting of clinical and diagnostics data from
      patients treated by Medtronic therapies or patients wearing Medtronic implantable devices
      used within their intended use. The One Hospital ClinicalService is composed by a suite of
      systematic, data-guided activities designed to bring about immediate improvements in health
      delivery in particular settings. Data are prospectively collected. An independent committee
      of physicians prospectively identifies key clinical questions on a yearly basis for
      development of quality improvement activities, analyses and publications. A charter, approved
      by Hospital Istitutional Review Boards or other Hospital entities, assigns the ownership of
      data to the centers and governs the conduct of the project and the relationship of the
      scientific committee and Medtronic. Hospital is the data controller, while Medtronic is the
      data processor on behalf of the Hospital. Data collected for quality improvement purposes may
      be mined to perform clinical research.

NCT01007630,A Study Assessing Change in Sense of Smell After Rasagiline Use in Parkinson's Patients,"
      A decrease or loss of the sense of smell is very common in patients with Parkinson's Disease
      even in the earliest stages of the disease. There have been no treatments that have been
      proven to improve sense of smell in patients with Parkinson's Disease.

      Rasagiline (brand name: Azilect) was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
      on May 16th 2006 to be used by Parkinson's patients to treat the motor symptoms associated
      with the disease. The purpose of this study is to see if there is change in sense of smell
      after starting Rasagiline.

NCT01008384,The Effect of Vitamin D Repletion on Small Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL) Particle Number in Subjects at Elevated Cardiovascular Risk,"
      Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that is naturally present in very few foods, added to
      others, and available as a dietary supplement. It is also produced in the body when
      ultraviolet rays from sunlight strike the skin and trigger vitamin D synthesis. Vitamin D is
      essential for promoting calcium absorption and maintaining adequate serum calcium and
      phosphate concentrations to enable normal mineralization of bone and bone growth. Without
      sufficient vitamin D, bones can become thin, brittle, or misshapen. Vitamin D sufficiency
      prevents rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. Together with calcium, vitamin D
      also helps protect older adults from osteoporosis. Many people have low levels of Vitamin D.
      Replacing Vitamin D is thought to help lower the risk of heart disease. Vitamin D may be
      helpful, but it could also be harmful. The investigators are studying the effect of Vitamin D
      on the level of a harmful kind of cholesterol. Participants will have their cholesterol
      levels measured and then receive either Vitamin D or a placebo. After 2 months of treatment,
      the investigators will measure their cholesterol levels again.

NCT01008709,Comparison Study of Two Different Surgical Clips During Laparoscopic Urologic Surgery,"
      Intracorporeal suturing and knot tying during robotic prostatectomy and laparoscopic and
      robotic renal surgery have historically been considered the most technically challenging and
      time consuming aspects of these procedures. With improved operative technique as well as the
      use of innovative surgical devices, vascular control during these surgeries is often less
      cumbersome as compared with traditional techniques. Current standard methods of hemostasis
      include the use of clips, of which the most popular design is the Hemolock, a locking,
      nonabsorbable plastic clip, or the use of the very expensive endomechanical stapler.
      Unfortunately while they are associated with time savings in the operating room, there is a
      great deal of disposable costs associated with these various devices as well as a not
      insignificant device malfunction rate reported in the literature. The aim of this
      case-controlled study is to evaluate the Aesculap U-clip device compared to our current
      technique of vascular control using the Teleflex Hemolock clip device during minimally

NCT01009398,Thoracic Paravertebral Catheters,"
      Thoracic operations are known to be painful and requiring an adequate postoperative pain
      therapy. A well documented technique to achieve postoperative analgesia is the use of
      paravertebral catheters. Theoretically the thoracic paravertebral block results in an
      unilateral thoracic anaesthesia. However, in the daily clinical practice it remains unclear
      whether catheters are placed correctly into the paravertebral region. The investigators'
      experiences with paravertebral catheters suggest that there may be many displacements of
      catheters since the pain control is reduced compared to epidural analgesia.

      The aim of this prospective observational clinical trial is to postoperatively evaluate the
      exact location of paravertebral catheter placed for thoracoscopic interventions by using the
      classical land-mark puncture technique. After radiological detection of the catheter
      position, the spread and distribution of contrast dye injected through the catheters will be

      cell minimal epitopes and 3 Clusters of Differentiation number 4 (CD4) T cell epitopes and a
      new adjuvant (CAF01). The vaccine should induce cellular immunity against human
      immuno-deficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1).

      Target group: Untreated healthy individuals with chronic HIV-1 infection who are not in
      antiretroviral treatment.

      Purpose: The primary purpose is to evaluate tolerability and safety of the vaccine.

      The secondary purpose is to evaluate the clinical effect of the vaccination treatment as
      measured by induction of new T cell immunity, lowering of HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) viral
      load in plasma, and improvement in the patient CD4 lymphocyte blood counts.

      Design: The experiment is designed as a single-blinded, placebo-controlled phase 1 clinical
      trial in HIV-1 infected individuals in Denmark.

      Numbers of individuals: 20 fully evaluable HIV-1-infected patients should enter the study (15
      vaccine treated and 5 placebo(saline) treated controls).

      The hypothesis is that a redirection of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) immunity to selected
      relatively immune silent (subdominant) but conserved CTL targets on multiple sites in HIV-1
      could provide a better immune control of the virus replication. This could result in lowering

NCT01003704,Incidence of Phantom Limb Pain and Method of Anesthesia After Lower Extremity Amputation,"
      Phantom limb pain (pain originating from where an amputated limb once was) is a common
      occurrence after lower extremity amputations, with some sources noting incidence to be as
      high as 60-80% six months after surgery. This pain can eventually subside, however, cases
      have been reported of incidence 10 years after surgery. This pain is not only physically
      detrimental, but can also be psychologically detrimental after a difficult to accept change
      in the body. Prior studies have been performed using regional anesthetic techniques
      (including spinals and epidurals) and different medications to attempt to reduce the
      incidence of phantom limb pain, however, the data have been mostly inconclusive. Of interest,
      prior studies have not addressed peripheral nerve blocks, a method of anesthesia/analgesia
      more commonly employed for amputations recently. The purpose of our retrospective study is to
      look at the incidence of phantom limb pain at our institution over a two year period to
      determine if peripheral nerve blocks result in a significantly reduced incidence compared to
      other techniques (spinal, epidural, general anesthesia only). In addition, there is little
      data on relation of reason for amputation and presence of preoperative neuropathy and
      incidence of phantom pain. As secondary endpoints, the investigators wish to investigate if
      certain reasons for amputation (trauma, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes, and others)
      and/or neuropathy lead to a higher incidence of phantom limb pain. The results of this study
      could impact future management of patients who are to receive amputations and may lead to
      further prospective studies on the topics involved.

NCT01003262,Evaluating an Emergency Department Observation Syncope Protocol for Older Adults,"
      Syncope, defined as a transient loss of consciousness, accounts for over 700,000 annual U.S.
      emergency department visits and may herald a life-threatening condition in older adults
      (age≥60 years). Existing risk prediction instruments cannot reliably identify who among such
      older patients can safely be discharged home from an emergency department. As a result, the
      majority of older patients without a clear cause for syncope are hospitalized for diagnostic
      evaluation. However, current admission practices are characterized by low diagnostic yield,
      do not clearly improve outcomes, and account for over $2.4 billion in annual hospital costs.
      Most admitted patients are discharged within 48 hours, and approximately 50% of patients do
      not have an identified cause of syncope after their hospitalization.

      The implementation of an expedited and standardized Emergency Department Observation Syncope
      Protocol (EDOSP) may safely reduce hospitalization of older patients with syncope. The
      investigators propose a pilot randomized trial to implement and evaluate EDOSP at two
      emergency departments. This study has the following exploratory Specific Aims:

        1. To compare admission rates and length-of-stay associated with EDOSP to standard care.

        2. To compare serious outcomes rates associated with EDOSP to standard care.

        3. To compare quality-of-life associated with EDOSP to standard care.

        4. To compare the incremental costs and cost-effectiveness of EDOSP to standard care.

      Over a one-year period, 120 intermediate-risk older adults who present with syncope at the
      two study sites will be randomized to 1 of 2 arms: 1.) intervention arm: expedited and
      standardized EDOSP care; or 2.) control arm: routine care consisting of admission from the
      emergency department.

      If this pilot trial suggests that EDOSP can safely reduce admissions, then the investigators
      will plan a larger study powered to evaluate clinical, quality-of-life, and economic
      outcomes. A successful EDOSP intervention would have important clinical policy implications
      and improve the emergency department care of older adults with syncope.

NCT01002196,Randomised Controlled Treatment Study of Selective Mutism,"
      Selective mutism (SM) describes inhibited and withdrawn children who are persistently mute in
      central situations despite ability to talk. SM may cause great suffering and create problems,
      both socially and related to learning. SM is associated with social anxiety,
      neurodevelopmental delay and bilingualism. The prevalence is about .7-8 ‰. Adequate
      assessment and treatment of SM is seldom provided in the mental health services. SM is
      considered hard to treat, and randomised treatment studies are lacking. This study will
      examine the effect of a manual based treatment for SM. The treatment consists of home- and
      kindergarten /school based interventions including behaviour techniques and psychoeducation.
      Defocused communication is a general treatment principle. Comorbidity, including
      neurodevelopmental delay /disorder, and predictors of outcome, will be examined. A pilot
      study was conducted to ensure the feasibility of the planned effectiveness study. Seven
      children, aged 3-5 years were included. Six has started treatment, and all talked in the
      kinder garden within the first 3 months. The present study will have a randomised controlled
      design with 1. Manual based intervention for 6 months compared to 2. Waiting list controls (3
      months), and then manual based intervention. The sample: Children aged 3-9 years
      consecutively referred to the school psychology- or the mental health services in Oslo and
      Eastern Norway. Expected N = 24 based on the pilot study, is a sufficient sample size to
      answer our primary research question. The treatment will be given by a therapist from the
      research group or by a local clinician under supervision. The study can add essential
      knowledge on treatment of SM and make effective treatment available to clinicians in the

NCT01000792,3-D Visualization of the Anti-Obstructive Effect of Levocetirizine,"
      The prevalence of allergic rhinitis is high and appears to be rising worldwide. Therefore, it
      is important and necessary to understand and visualize therapy effects on this disease. In
      this study we will demonstrate the effect of levocetirizine on nasal cavity dimensions by
      assessing not only standard nasal flow diagnostics such as rhinomanometry and acoustic
      rhinometry, but supplement exami¬nation procedures with long-term rhinometry and magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI). With the aid of a virtual model and computer fluid dynamics, we are
      able to simulate nasal air flow and provide three-dimensional visualization of the computed
      flow.

      In previous trials ([Bachert], [deBlic], [Day] and [Deruaz]) it has been shown that allergic
      symptoms, especially nasal congestion, diminish significantly under treatment with
      levocetirizine. We will demonstrate this anti-obstructive effect by comparing the reaction to
      nasal allergen challenge before and after four-week treatment with levocetirizine.

NCT01000103,Using Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) in the Rehabilitation of Chronic Spatial Neglect After Stroke,"
      Visuospatial neglect is a common neurological symptom which appears following strokes on
      regions of the right hemisphere of the brain. It affects patient's self representation and
      awareness of the space, impairing functional rehabilitation and adaptation back to a normal
      life. The primary purpose of this protocol is to assess the impact of 10 daily sessions of a
      non-invasive brain stimulation technique, low frequency repetitive Transcranial Magnetic
      Stimulation (rTMS), applied on the intact hemisphere of the brain to treat post stroke
      visuospatial neglect at the chronic stage. The hypothesis is that a regime of real but not
      sham rTMS on the left posterior parietal cortex of the brain will long-lastingly ameliorate
      visuospatial neglect in stroke patients as revealed by clinical paper-and-pencil and
      computer-based tests assessing search, detection and discrimination of stimuli presented in

NCT01002586,"Wii-Fit For Improving Activity, Gait And Balance In Alzheimer's Dementia","
      Alzheimer's Dementia (AD) contributes to poor balance, impaired gait and functional status,
      thereby, increasing the risk of falls. AD is an independent risk factor for hip fractures.
      Those with balance problems and gait impairments are at higher risk for long term placement
      and death related to falls. Gait impairments in those with dementia include shortened step
      length, increased double support time, step to step variability, and decreased gait speed.
      These gait impairments worsen with dual tasking probably due to common brain areas involved
      in gait and other cognitive tasks.

      Exercise interventions improve gait and balance in the elderly. In subjects with existing AD,
      physical activity has shown to prevent further cognitive decline and improve quality of life
      and prevent falls. However, it is difficult to engage patients with AD in long term exercise
      programs. The expense of physical therapy limits its easy accessibility. Use of everyday
      technology might bridge this gap by providing high level of engagement via the use of
      multimedia while providing a cost effective alternative. Wii Fit is one such multimedia
      platform.

      Wii fit is a Nintendo gaming console used for aerobics, strength training and balance
      activities. This device includes a balance board that senses weight and shifts in movement
      and balance. Virtual trainers talk the user through the activity while tracking the user's
      progress.

      Although some skilled nursing facilities have started using Wii game system adjunct to
      routine physical therapy, there have not been any studies. Anecdotal reports note improvement
      in balance and social benefits using the Wii Fit program. Physical therapists report the
      ability to customize Wii for each patient. Wii Fit can be successfully used in a cognitively
      impaired population. A unique feature of this approach is the enjoyment and enthusiasm that
      many patients derive which is reflected in high levels of engagement.

      The invesitgators propose an 8 week prospective randomized study with the treatment group
      receiving the exercise program delivered by Wii-Fit system and the comparison arm receiving a
      walking exercise program in a community dwelling setting. Subjects in each arm will
      participate for 30 minutes daily five days a week.

NCT01002547,Prevalence of Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) in Hispanics With Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 (T2DM) and Role of Treatment,"
      Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a chronic liver condition frequently associated
      with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and characterized by insulin resistance and hepatic fat
      accumulation. Liver fat may range from simple steatosis to severe steatohepatitis with
      necroinflammation and variable degrees of fibrosis (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis or NASH). Up
      to 40% of patients with NAFLD develop NASH in recent series. Risk factors for progression to
      NASH are unclear, but appears to be more common and progress more rapidly in older
      individuals, and in the presence of obesity and T2DM. Because the VA population in San
      Antonio, Texas, frequently combine these risk factors for NASH it was felt that a study
      targeting this very high-risk population was needed.

      This study will establish the long-term efficacy (primary endpoint: liver histology) and
      safety of pioglitazone for the treatment of VA patients with T2DM and NASH. All patients
      diagnosed with NASH will be offered lifestyle modification/weight loss (current standard of
      care) while being randomized to pioglitazone, vitamin E or placebo for up to 3 years. We
      believe that in such a high-risk population for complications from NASH, a substantial
      benefit may be expected from early detection and treatment.

      Specifically, the arms are: a) pioglitazone + vitamin E; b) vitamin E + placebo of
      pioglitazone; c) placebo of both. Patients are randomized to one of these 3 arms, and
      followed in a double-blind fashion for up to 18 months. Patients are then offered to continue
      into an open-label phase with pioglitazone + vitamin E or vitamin E alone for another 18
      months.

NCT01003236,Evaluating the Renoprotective Effect of Milk Thistle Extract on Patients With Type II Diabetic Nephropathy,"
      There is considerable evidence that increased blood glucose results in the generation of
      reactive oxygen species, ultimately leading to increased oxidative stress in a variety of
      tissues. This may lead to the activation of stress-sensitive intracellular signaling
      pathways, causing cellular damage and late complications of diabetes including renal injury.
      Although the investigators understanding of how hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress
      ultimately leads to tissue damage has advanced considerably in recent years, effective
      therapeutic strategies to prevent or delay the development of this damage remain limited. The
      flavonoid complex silymarin, an extract from the milk thistle, and its major pharmacological
      active component silibinin are free radical scavengers and potent membrane stabilizers by
      preventing lipid peroxidation. Furthermore, during early stages of diabetes, flavonoids
      minimize oxidative stress, and inflammation which represent important factors in the
      development of diabetic nephropathy.

      In this study the investigators plan to evaluate the renoprotective effect of milk thistle
      extract on type II diabetic patients with kidney disease.

NCT01000155,Efficacy of Vorinostat to Induce Fetal Hemoglobin in Sickle Cell Disease,"
      Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is a hereditary anemia that causes the red blood cells to change
      their shape from a round and doughnut-like shape to a half-moon/crescent, or sickled shape.
      People who have SCD have a different type of hemoglobin (protein that carries oxygen). This
      different type of hemoglobin makes the red blood cells change into a crescent shape under
      certain conditions. Sickle-shaped cells are a problem because they often get stuck in the
      blood vessels blocking the flow of blood and can cause inflammation and injury to important
      areas of the body. All babies are born with hemoglobin called fetal hemoglobin (HbF). Soon
      after birth, HbF production slows down and another hemoglobin called adult hemoglobin (HbA)
      is made. Clinical studies have shown that increasing the amount of HbF in the blood may
      prevent sickling of the red blood cells. Vorinostat has been used in the treatment of cancers
      and in other research studies and information from those suggests that it may help treat SCD
      by increasing the amount of HbF in the blood. The purpose of this research study is to
      determine the effectiveness and safety of vorinostat when used to treat SCD.

NCT01001845,Comparative Effects of Milk Thistle Extract With Vitamin-E in Hemodialysis Patients,"
      For end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients, cardiovascular disease remains the single most
      common cause of excess morbidity and mortality. Among the examined nontraditional risk
      factors, an increase in oxidative stress as well as inflammation are postulated to contribute
      to excessive cardiovascular risk in this population.

      Flavonoids are naturally occurring substances that possess various pharmacological actions
      and therapeutic applications. Some due to their phenolic structures have antioxidant effect
      and inhibit free radical-mediated processes, as well as anti-inflammatory effects.
      Silymarin,a mixture of three isomeric flavonolignans, is isolated from milk thistle (Silybum
      marianum) seeds, and is proven to have anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, cell regenerating,
      and antifibrotic action.

      In this study, the effect of silymarin on oxidative stress and inflammation (2 major risk
      factors for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in hemodialysis patients)is evaluated, and
      compared to vit E, a well known antioxidant.

      The purpose of this research study is to determine how well the combination of bevacizumab
      and carboplatin works in treating breast cancer that has spread to the brain. Bevacizumab is
      an antibody (a protein that attacks a foreign substance in the body) that is made in the
      laboratory. Bevacizumab works differently from the way chemotherapy drugs work. Usually
      chemotherapy drugs attack fast growing cancer cells in the body. Bevacizumab works to slow or
      stop the growth of cells in cancer tumors by decreasing the blood supply to the tumors. When
      the blood supply is decreased, the tumors don't get the oxygen and nutrients they need to
      grow. Carboplatin is in a class of drugs known as platinum-containing compounds and has been
      approved for use in the treatment of ovarian cancer. Information from other research studies
      suggests that the combination of bevacizumab with carboplatin may be effective in treating

NCT01005017,Percutaneous Lesioning Splanchnic Nerves in Patients With Chronic Pancreatitis,"
      Chronic pancreatitis is a progressive inflammatory disease resulting in slow destruction of
      the pancreas. This chronic inflammation can lead to chronic abdominal pain which can last for
      many years. Unfortunately, medical management often is of only limited benefit in treating
      the pain of chronic pancreatitis.

      Management of patients with intractable pain is difficult, often resulting in narcotic
      addiction.

      Early results in a small group of patients suggest that percutaneous radiofrequent lesioning
      of splanchnic nerves has good potential for pain control in a subset of patients with chronic
      pancreatitis. Given the simplicity of the procedure, it clearly warrants reappraisal to
      identify its current role in pancreatic pain management.

NCT01005433,Dexmedetomidine for Cesarean Delivery,"
      Regional anesthesia has become the anesthetic of choice for cesarean section in most
      countries; however, some women still prefer general anesthesia techniques. There are many
      trials for the pharmacological modifications of the sympathetic response to surgery,
      including opioids, tenoxicam, ketorolac, lidocaine and paracetamol. However, opioid
      administration to the mother before delivery has adverse neonatal effects. This research is a

NCT01005472,Temozolomide and Sunitinib Malate in Treating Patients With Stage III or Stage IV Malignant Melanoma,"
      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop
      the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.
      Sunitinib malate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed
      for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving temozolomide together with
      sunitinib malate may kill more tumor cells.

      Phase II was never conducted due to toxicity in phase I.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of sunitinib malate
      when given together with temozolomide and to see how well they work in treating patients with
      stage III or stage IV malignant melanoma.

NCT01006109,Recording and Modulation of Neuronal Mechanisms During Operant Conditioning: a MEG Study,"
      Background:

      - Most of the time, humans make decisions according to their consequences, especially if they
      will be beneficial, and will avoid or try to avoid doing an action if it has a bad outcome.
      The way that the brain prepares a movement has been studied in detail, but the way the brain
      makes decisions before carrying out an action is still poorly understood. Researchers are
      interested in learning more about the decision-making process and how it affects the brain.

      Objectives:

      - To record the activity of the brain during decision-making processes.

      Eligibility:

      - Healthy, right-handed volunteers between 18 and 40 years of age.

      Design:

        -  Potential participants will have a screening visit with a medical history and
           neurological examination to determine eligibility.

        -  This study requires seven visits: one magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) visit and 6
           magnetoencephalography (MEG) recording visits. The MEG recording visits will include
           transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). All visits will be spaced at least 1 week
           apart. Total participation will last about 6 weeks.

        -  Participants will have an MRI scan at the first study visit.

        -  The MEG procedures will record brain activity during a series of computer tests
           involving winning or losing money. TMS will be performed during these visits, separate

NCT01007253,Effect of Veramyst and Olopatadine 0.2% Opthalmic Solution on Allergy Symptoms,"
      People who have hayfever or allergic rhinitis often complain about eye symptoms associated
      with their nasal symptoms. How people with hayfever develop eye symptoms is not clear. The
      purpose of this study is to better understand the generation of eye symptoms in patients with
      allergic rhinitis. We have previously shown that placing the substance that subjects are
      allergic to in their nose causes both nose and eye symptoms. This can be explain by a
      parasympathetic neurogenic reflex from the nose to the eye. Such a reflex would readily
      explain the tearing and watery eye symptoms, but does not explain the itch. In this study, we
      are going to address one possible explanation for the itch; does an axonal neurogenic reflex
      stimulate mast cells in the eye to release histamine, which then causes the itch? We will do
      this by placing an antihistamine drop in the eye and challenge the nose with allergen. We
      will also attempt to demonstrate that mast activation isn't effected by blocking the
      initiating of the reflex with a nasal steroid, as done in our previous study, and showing
      that the addition of an antihistamine does not add to the reduction of symptoms.

      Currently, plastic wound retractors are used in abdominal surgery to facilitate access to the

      study. Swabs are taken from the inside and the outside of the plastic wound retractor prior
      to removing the retractor from the abdomen. The bacterial flora from swabs taken inside and
      outside the plastic wound protector are then compared to see if there is any difference
      between inside and outside the retractor. Bacteria are classified as 'enteric'(i.e. from the
      gastrointestinal tract) or 'skin' bacteria, depending on their usual location. The study aims
      to establish whether a plastic wound retractor (Alexis®) reduces translocation of enteric

      leading cause of perinatal mortality and morbidity. Preterm birth is a major public health
      problem. Preterm labor leading to preterm birth is difficult to diagnose and prediction of
      preterm birth is a medical challenge. In the past years, research found that transvaginal
      ultrasound to assess the cervix of the uterus and vaginal detection of inflammatory protein,
      specific bacteria and fetal fibronectin can help to detect women at increase risk of preterm
      delivery. The investigators believe that a combination of these tests can lead to a better
      prediction of preterm delivery. The investigators want to conduct a study among women judged
      at increase risk of preterm delivery by their physician (having contractions, modified
      cervix, past-history of preterm delivery or multiple pregnancy) and assess their cervix by
      ultrasound and sample their vaginal secretion. The investigators want to analyze the vaginal
      sampling and look for inflammatory proteins. The objective of this study is to prove the

NCT01009138,Evaluation of a Diabetes-specific Cognitive Behavioural Treatment for Subthreshold Depression,"
      This work is supported by the ""Kompetenznetz Diabetes mellitus (Competence Network for
      Diabetes mellitus)"" funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (FKZ 01GI0809).

      Approximately one third of diabetic patients has elevated depressive symptoms. The majority
      of these patients are suffering from a subthreshold depression. In spite of the fact that
      subthreshold depression has an equivalent negative impact on the prognosis of diabetes as
      clinical depression, there is no specific intervention tool. The main objective of this
      project is to develop a diabetes specific cognitive behavioural treatment (DS-CBT) for
      diabetic patients with subthreshold depression. In a randomized trail DS-CBT is compared to
      standard diabetes education. A total of 188 diabetic patients will be recruited and randomly
      assigned to the two treatment conditions. The expected main outcome is the reduction of
      subthreshold depression under DS-CBT in a 12 month follow up. Secondary variables are
      improvement of glycaemic control, quality of life, diabetes self-management as well as
      reduction of health care costs and modification of inflammatory parameters.

NCT01001325,Does Seasonal Influenza Vaccination Affect the Incidence of pH1N1 Influenza?,"
      Since the onset of the 2009 pandemic, several observational public health investigations in
      Canada have identified evidence that suggests that adults, particularly younger adults, who
      have previously received seasonal influenza vaccine are at increased risk of infection with
      the 2009 pandemic strain of H1N1 (pH1N1). Investigations in Australia, the United States and
      the United Kingdom have not identified this effect. While it is not possible to have an
      answer to whether this affect is real prior to the second wave of the 2009 pandemic, it
      remains vital to future influenza vaccination programs that the hypothesis that, in 2009,
      seasonal vaccine increases or decreases the risk of pH1N1 infection be confirmed or refuted.

NCT01002833,Comparison of Three Plasmodium Falciparum Isolates in an Experimental Human Malaria Infection,"
      Plasmodium falciparum isolates display a wide genetic diversity with possibly different
      properties to induce immune responses. These properties could directly influence the ability
      to induce protective efficacy. Since 1998 an experimental human malaria infection model at
      the Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Center (RUNMC) has been very successful in answering
      questions with regards to immunological mechanisms of human Pf infection. To date only the
      NF54 strain of Pf has been deployed in this Nijmegen model. However, investigation of
      heterologous Pf challenge is not only highly informative for our basic understanding of
      induction of immune responses but also provides an essential model for protective capacity
      testing in the clinical development of candidate malaria vaccines. Recently, the parasite
      culture laboratory of the RUNMC has been able to overcome technical hurdles to produce
      infectious mosquitoes of two genetically different isolates from different geographical

NCT01000233,Value of Oral Phytate (InsP6) in the Prevention of Progression of the Cardiovascular Calcifications,"
      Intervention study focused on preventing the progression of aortic valve calcification.

      Vascular and cardiac calcifications are a marker of risk and poor outcome, especially the
      severe calcified aortic stenosis and coronary calcification.

      Its increasing prevalence is now a health problem. The knowledge and the therapeutic
      objective of this condition have changed in recent years and pathophysiological aspects at
      present, focus on atherosclerotic disease and inflammation.

      Several clinical trials have failed to demonstrate that statins or ACE inhibitors prevent the
      progression of cardiovascular calcification.

      Taking into account the new concepts of ectopic calcification and research results from our
      group, the most logical approach to prevent progression would be an early intervention and
      management of the calcification inhibiting agents such as phytate (inositol six-phosphate --
      InsP6).

      Hypothesis: The phytate prevents or delays the progression of cardiovascular calcification.

      It is a clinical trial of intervention of oral phytate (InsP6) in patients with mild to
      moderate cardiovascular calcification (aortic valve and / or coronary arteries) compared with
      placebo over a period of 24 months.

      It is a prospective, randomized minimization of variables to ensure homogeneity of the
      groups.

      The primary analysis will be the time evolution of the extent of calcium in the aortic valve
      and coronary arteries made with CT.

      Secondary variables are the degree of progression of aortic stenosis and clinical events
      (death, stroke, angina, stroke and cancer of any type).

NCT01003249,Dysfunctional Voiding and Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms With Baclofen,"
      Dysfunctional voiding is often associated with constipation. The association of constipation
      with urologic pathologic processes has previously been described since the 1950's, but it was
      only over the past decade that clinicians have paid more attention to this relationship and
      recognized it existence with the term dysfunctional elimination syndrome (DES). This term is
      used to reflect the broad spectrum of functional disturbances that may affect the urinary
      tract including that of functional bowl disturbances and can be classified as follows:

        -  Functional disorder of filling: overactive bladder, over distention of bladder or
           insensate bladder, which may be associated with fecal impaction or rectal distention
           with infrequent bowel movements

        -  Functional disorder of emptying: over-recruitment of pelvic floor activity during
           voiding causing interrupted and/or incomplete emptying also associated with defecation
           difficulties due to non- relaxation of the puborectalis muscle, dyssynergic defecation
           or pain with defecation Several different therapeutic options have been used for
           patients with dysfunctional voiding mainly to decrease bladder outlet obstruction. These
           treatments including, alpha adrenergic antagonists, and botulinum toxin are less than
           optimum. One possible explanation for these drug failures includes the inability of
           these medications to relax the striated muscles of the pelvic floor necessary for
           voiding.

      To date there has been no data to evaluate the role of baclofen on the striated muscle of the
      external anal sphincter, essential in the defecation process.

NCT01003223,Phosphate Kinetic Modeling,"
      Cardiovascular disease is a major cause of death in hemodialysis (HD) patients and is
      associated with widespread vascular calcification. There is a consensus that the chronic
      overload of calcium and phosphorus is a major factor in vascular calcification.
      Hyperphosphatemia, deleterious in dialysis patients, is aggressively monitored and treated.
      Phosphate binders - designed to bind dietary phosphate and thus prevent its absorption, are
      ubiquitous in the dialysis patient population, and calcium-based phosphate binders are often
      first line therapy because they are tolerated well by the patients and low in cost. Phosphate
      Kinetic Modeling (PKM) is a tool to help physicians manage a hemodialysis patient's phosphate
      level. Once a subject consents to participate in the study, the subject's dietary phosphate
      intake will be estimated and the appropriate dose of the phosphate binder calcium acetate
      (PhosLo) will be recommended accordingly. If necessary, the Ca++ concentration of the
      dialysate will be changed to remove any excess calcium absorbed as the result of an increase
      in the PhosLo prescription to control phosphorus.Ongoing recommendations regarding oral

NCT01004354,Vitamin D Supplementation in Psychiatric Illnesses,"
      Children and adolescents with psychiatric illnesses who are treated with medications called
      second generation antipsychotic agents (SGA) often gain excessive weight during their
      treatment with these medications. This weight gain may result in the development of features
      of the metabolic syndrome or frank diabetes mellitus. There is no consensus on the best way
      to prevent these complications. The investigators' hypothesis is that daily vitamin D
      supplementation in these patients will result in decreased levels of the markers of metabolic
      syndrome with associated reduction in waist circumference.

NCT01002976,Correlation Between IgE Parameters and the Response to Omalizumab in Subjects With Severe Asthma,"
      Omalizumab is an anti-IgE recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody.The efficacy and
      tolerability of omalizumab have been demonstrated in patients with moderate-to-severe and
      allergic (IgE-mediated) asthma. Clinical benefit with omalizumab is observed when serum free
      IgE levels are reduced to 50 ng/mL or less. However, although the causal role of IgE in
      allergic disease is well established, the relationship between free IgE and clinical symptoms
      of asthma has not been accurately quantified. Recent study demonstrated that omalizumab and
      free IgE concentrations are correlated with clinical outcomes. In non responder to omalizumab
      the clinical symptoms show random fluctuations around baseline without any tendency toward
      improvement despite adequate suppression of free IgE. In these patients it may be the ratio
      of specific IgE to total IgE or inter-patient variability in the expression of FceRI on
      effector cells that define whether the patient will respond or not to omalizumab.

      This current study is designed to evaluate the mechanisms of responsiveness to omalizumab
      measuring the free IgE, specific IgE and the level of FceRI expression on the effector cell
      and the correlation to clinical response.

      Silicone gel is a self-drying silicone polymer that forms thin film after application onto
      the skin. Because silicone film is a medical device, silicone gel is also regarded as a
      medical device. Silicone gel has been on the market for many years for the management of scar
      in the phase of treatment as well as in the phase of prevention. In contrast to other methods
      that are expensive, invasive or inconvenient, silicone gel is convenient, non-invasive and
      also reasonably priced. However, the number of well-designed clinicial trials for efficacy
      and safety are not enough to provide robust evidences in making clinical decisions for scar
      management options. In a prospective, multi-center, investigator-blind randomized half-split
      study for patients undergoing cesarean sections, the investigators attempt to provide valid
      information for the efficacy and safety of silicone gel in the prevention phase of scar.

      This study will compare two supraglottic airway devices currently on the market. Supraglottic
      airway devices are used during general anesthesia to provide a patent airway. They are
      inserted blindly into the mouth once the patient has lost consciousness and they cover the
      laryngeal inlet. The I-Gel and the Supreme laryngeal mask airway (LMA) are the two devices to
      be compared. The I-Gel has no inflatable cuff, which makes it different from all other
      supraglottic airway devices currently in use. The Supreme shares some characteristics of the
      other LMA devices, but it is disposable. Our main goal will be to compare the airway leak
      pressure and the peak airway pressure of each devices. We will also measure the time needed
      for insertion, number of attempts needed to secure the airway and side effects related to the
      airway (cough, dysphagia, trauma, hoarseness of voice, sore throat).

      Fanconi anemia (FA) and Dyskeratosis congenita (DC) are inherited bone marrow failure
      syndromes. The current androgen treatments (e.g., oxymetholone) used to treat FA and DC can
      cause unwanted masculinizing side effects, indicating a need for a different medication.
      Danazol is a less potent androgen,and may therefore have fewer masculinizing side effects.
      Danazol is currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of
      other diseases, but it has never been studied in patients with FA and DC.

      The main purpose of this study is to see if danazol is a safe treatment for FA and DC.
      Specifically,we would like to determine:

        -  the best dose of danazol;

        -  how fast hemoglobin (a protein that carries oxygen in the blood) levels rise in FA and

NCT01003639,Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension Treatment Trial,"
      Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), also called pseudotumor cerebri, is a disorder of
      elevated intracranial pressure of unknown cause [Corbett, et al., 1982; Wall, et al., 1991].
      Its incidence is 22.5 new cases each year per 100,000 overweight women of childbearing age,
      and is rising [Garrett, et al., 2004] in parallel with the obesity epidemic. It affects about
      100,000 Americans. Most patients suffer debilitating headaches. Because of pressure on the
      optic nerve (papilledema), 86% have some degree of permanent visual loss and 10% develop
      severe visual loss [Wall, et al., 1991]. Interventions to prevent loss of sight, all with
      unproven efficacy, include diet, diuretics such as acetazolamide, repeated spinal taps, optic
      nerve sheath fenestration surgery, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunting procedures. The
      purported goal of these therapies is to lower intracranial pressure; however, it is unclear
      which treatments work and by what mechanism. None of these strategies has been verified by
      properly designed clinical trials. Thus, there is confusion, uncertainty, and weak scientific
      rationales to guide treatment decisions. This trial will study subjects who have mild visual
      loss from IIH to (1) establish convincing, evidence-based treatment strategies for IIH to
      restore and protect vision, (2) follow subjects up to 4 years to observe the long-term
      treatment outcomes and (3) determine the cause of IIH. To meet those aims, the trial will be
      divided into a 12-month intervention phase and a 3-year observational phase. Subjects are not
      required to complete the observational phase of the study, but will be asked to do so and
      consented for the observational phase of the study at the conclusion of the intervention

NCT01002638,The Occlusive Dressing,"
      Fingers amputations are very common injuries among the patients arriving at the Emergency
      Department. Fingertips amputations classified in 2nd and 3rd zones, in accordance with
      Rosenthal's classification (after the solum unguis), constitute a large proportion of them.
      The treatment aims at restoring a pulp with its sensitivity and a good subcutaneous fat
      tissue. The usual care of these amputations is a surgical treatment: it consists of pulp
      reconstruction by a flap (for example palmar V-Y advancement flaps of Atazoy). These
      technique involve hospital admission, brachial plexus anaesthesia, a surgical approach with
      cicatrix and donor site morbidities, postoperative cares, post-surgical pain management. And
      of course attention must be paid to the risks of postoperative complications related either
      to anaesthesia and/or to surgery, like necrosis, infection, and others. We have developed a
      nonoperative treatment for fingertips amputations: the occlusive dressing. It's a technique
      that has been known for about twenty years, and that is currently developed by the teams SOS
      main of Professor Liverneaux in Strasbourg and of Professor Obert in Besançon. It consists of
      the occlusive application of two Tegaderm®, a plastic dressing. Then the finger macerates in
      an anaerobic medium, and could develop an uncomfortable smell induced by maceration process.
      The first results described by the preclinical studies of these two groups look satisfying on
      both the functional aspect (sensibility) and the aesthetic component (preservation of the
      finger length and curve), as well as for healing that occurs without infection. Moreover, the
      length of the treatment is of about only three or four weeks, and its cost is very low by
      comparison with the cost of the surgery itself. Nevertheless this technique is still not very
      common, and it has been reported in only five references in the literature [Mennen & Al.,
      Farrell & Al., Lee & Al., Allen & Al., Tago Hiroyuk & Al.]. On the other hand, the mechanism
      of action and/or the active components of this occlusive dressing have not yet been the
      objects of extended studies. An explanatory hypothesis is that some anaerobic germs and/or
      growth factors might play an active role in the process. However, they have not been
      identified yet. The aim of our study is to validate through clinical and biological criteria
      this non operative method and to compare with surgical treatment. The study will be held in
      the Hand Department of the University Hospital of Strasbourg, under the direction of the Pr
      Liverneaux. It will imply the collaboration of the laboratory of medical bacteriology
      directed by Pr Piemont, and the research department of INSERM (Parogène laboratory) will
      focus on the biochemistry. From a clinical point of view, a certain number of objective
      functional criteria will be measured: the pain will be evaluated by a visual analogic scale
      and the DN4 scale; the functional disability will be measured with the french version of the
      Disability Arm Shoulder Hand of Dubert; the pulpar 3D volume will be calculated from the
      numerical pictures with a computerized file, the cutaneous depth will be measured by 3D U.S;
      the tactile sensibility will be tested by standardized monofilaments and Weber's test and the
      dermatoglyphics of both handsides will be compared. In addition, the subjective feeling of
      the patients will be recorded through a visual and analogical scale of satisfaction. The
      purpose of the biological component of the study will be to put into light and to identify
      the components that are active in the process. This will be performed by the direct
      examination and by bacteriological cultures, and will look for the anaerobic, aerobic germs
      and the yeasts.The biochemical studies will first include a non specific search of growth
      factors, cytokines and interleukins. In a second step, specific researches will be undertaken
      if necessary in accordance with the results of the first investigations. By this study, the
      investigators would like to scientifically confirm the efficiency of this method with
      objective as well as subjective criteria, and to identify the underlying biomechanisms of the
      process.

NCT01003613,Evaluation of Tranilast to Treat Pterygium Before Excision,"
      Recurrent or secondary pterygium often has often a growing fibrovascular tissue more
      exuberant than the primary. Histological findings differ from the primary, since the typical
      changes in the degenerate connective tissue are absent. The strong immunoreactivity and
      release of basic fibroblast growth (b-FGF) in cultured fibroblasts of recurrent pterygia
      suggest that fibroblasts may play an important role in pterygium recurrence. Tranilast used
      is an antiallergic drug that has an inhibitory effect on the release of chemical
      transmitters, such as histamine and leukotrienes from mast cells as well as a suppressive
      effect on vascular permeability.This drug also reduces TGF-β1 production and collagen
      synthesis in various cells. Tranilast might reduce pterygium recurrence by suppressing TGF-β1
      synthesis in conjunctival fibroblast after pterygium surgery. The investigators want to
      confirm these findings and also compare the recurrence rate between the two types of surgery.
      Tranilast might be an alternative of mitomycin use, and also less toxic. This study aim to
      compare the effectiveness of preventing recurrence by using tranilast by topical
      subconjunctival administration previous to conjunctival autograft transplantation surgery in
      cases of primary pterygium, and will be perform clinical evaluation and TGF-beta-1

NCT01004913,Vestibular Evoked Myogenic Potentials in Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (VEMP in BPPV),"
      Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV) is the most frequent cause of vertigo of
      peripheral vestibular origin with life time incidence of 2.4%. BPPV is characterized by bouts
      of acute whirling vertigo lasting less than one minute provoked by changes in head position
      in relation to the gravitational vector. The vertigo is accompanied by typical rotational or
      horizontal nystagmus that is often demonstrated by the Dix-Hallpike maneuver and less
      frequently by testing for positional nystagmus. BPPV pathogenesis is currently explained by
      the fall of otoconia (calcium-carbonate crystals) or otoconial debris from the tectorial
      membrane of the otolithic organs into the dependant semicircular canals (canalithiasis) or
      adherence of such particles to the semicircular canal's cupula (cupulithiasis). Under these
      circumstances, the semicircular canal which normally responds only to angular velocity and
      acceleration is stimulated by gravity. Otoconial remnants as free floating particles inside
      the semicircular canal arms or attached to the cupula have been observed by few
      investigators. Although the presence of such particles explains most characteristics of the
      positioning nystagmus described in BPPV, it does not account for the dizziness and
      disequilibrium which are described by many patients even without changes in head position and
      the continuation of such symptoms after successful treatment of BPPV as evidenced by the
      resolution of positional vertigo and nystagmus.

      The study hypothesis is that otolithic pathology is an important component in the
      pathogenesis of BPPV explaining these symptoms, BPPV recurrence, and the refractoriness of
      some BPPV cases to the vastly employed particles repositioning treatments. In the present
      study the Vestibular Evoked Myogenic Potentials (VEMP) testing would be employed to measure
      the function of one of the otolithic organs - the saccule. The study objectives are: 1. To
      investigate possible malfunction of the saccule in patients suffering from BPPV. 2. To look
      for association between saccular pathology and BPPV recurrence and between such pathology and
      BPPV treatment failure. 3. To study possible relation between saccular pathology and
      continuation of dizziness and disequilibrium despite the resolution of positional vertigo.

NCT01006395,Prevention of Micro-architectural Bone Decay in Males With Non-metastatic Prostate Cancer Receiving Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT),"
      Less than 20% of men in whom prostate cancer is diagnosed early die from it. Cardiovascular
      disease is the most common cause of death in men with early prostate cancer. A commonly used
      form of treatment for prostate cancer is androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). ADT, while
      effective for the treatment of prostate cancer, has been linked to undesirable side effects,
      such as an increased risk of bone fractures and diabetes. Bisphosphonates, a class of drugs
      that prevent bone resorption, have been show to reduce the loss of bone mineral density that
      occurs as a consequence of ADT, but the effects of bisphosphonates on preservation of bone
      architecture is unknown.

      This project has two main goals:

      To assess prospectively, in men with prostate cancer receiving ADT, the effect of:

        1. the intravenous bisphosphonate zoledronic acidon ADT-induced microarchitectural decay of
           bone structure.

        2. ADT on insulin resistance and glucose metabolism. We will recruit 100 ambulatory men
           with non-metastatic prostate cancer who are about to commence a three year course of ADT
           as per routine clinical practice at Austin Health. Men will be randomised to receive
           either intravenous zoledronic acid (Aclasta, Novartis Pharmaceuticals) or placebo at
           baseline and after 12 months of ADT. Men with contraindications to zoledronic acid will
           be excluded from the study. All 100 study subjects will have clinical and laboratory
           assessment at baseline, and at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months (study end), and imaging
           studies at baseline and at 6, 12 and 24 months.

NCT01006772,Rehabilitation of Early Stroke Patients Using an AFO: an RCT,"
      Stroke is a major cause of disabilities worldwide. Stroke survivors commonly exhibit walking
      defects which lead to an altered, slow speed and asymmetric gait pattern. The main aims of
      rehabilitation are to enhance recovery of movement control and regain walking ability.
      Ankle-foot orthoses (AFOs), braces which encompass the foot and ankle joint extending to a
      point below the knee, are commonly prescribed to address ambulation impairments in stroke
      patients. Their main function is to support the foot and allow a subject to walk safely with
      a gait approaching normality. This project will aim to evaluate the early provision of AFOs
      as an adjunct to standard physiotherapy on the walking ability of stroke survivors. Usual
      rehabilitation practice will be the control condition. Participants will be recruited from
      the stroke unit of Stobhill Hospital in Glasgow. They will be randomised into two groups.
      Participants allocated in the control group will receive usual clinical practice as per
      routine for stroke patients. The intervention group will receive custom made solid AFOs as an
      adjunct. They will be provided with three AFOs, one for use during rehabilitation and two
      which will be used only during the outcome assessment sessions for research purposes. The
      intervention phase will last 24 weeks. Gait analysis will be performed three times for each
      participant (at baseline, 12 and 24 weeks after enrolment) in the biomechanical laboratory of
      Strathclyde University. During these sessions force and movement data of patients walking
      will be recorded. Fortnightly time and distance factors of gait will be measured and a
      battery of functional tasks will be performed in the physiotherapy gym of the hospital using
      a simple video camera and a grid lino-mat. During all assessments participants with an AFO
      will be asked to walk with and without the AFO provided.

      modified Atkins diet is a less restrictive option than the ketogenic diet, which has been
      effective in preliminary studies on refractory epilepsy in children, adolescents and adults.
      Modified Atkins diet may be of special importance in infants, as proteins are not restricted,
      hence no problems with growth are expected. Hence this pilot study has been planned to
      evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of the modified Atkins diet in infantile spasms

NCT01006863,Preoperative Ephedrine Attenuates the Hemodynamic Responses of Propofol During Valve Surgery: A Dose Dependent Study,"
      The prophylactic use of small doses of ephedrine may be effective in obtunding of the
      hypotension responses to propofol with minimal hemodynamic and ST segment changes. The
      investigators aimed to evaluate the effects of small doses of ephedrine on hemodynamic
      responses of propofol anesthesia for valve surgery.

      There is widespread interest in the use of propofol for the induction and maintenance of
      anesthesia for fast track cardiac surgery. However, its use for induction of anesthesia is
      often associated with a significant rate related transient hypotension for 5-10 minutes. This
      is mainly mediated with decrease in sympathetic activity with minor contribution of its
      direct vascular smooth muscle relaxation and direct negative inotropic effects.

      Ephedrine has demonstrated as a vasopressor drug for the treatment of hypotension in
      association with spinal and general anesthesia. Prophylactic use of high doses of ephedrine
      [10-30 mg] was effective in obtunding the hypotensive response to propofol with associated
      marked tachycardia. However, the use of smaller doses (0.1-0.2 mg/kg) was successfully
      attenuated, but not abolished, the decrease in blood pressure with transient increase in
      heart rate. This vasopressor effect is mostly mediated by β-stimulation rather than
      α-stimulation and also indirectly by releasing endogenous norepinephrine from sympathetic
      nerves.

      Because the effect of decreasing the dose of ephedrine from 0.1 to 0.07 mg/kg may be
      clinically insignificant, the investigators postulated that the prophylactic use of small
      dose of ephedrine may prevent propofol-induced hypotension after induction of anesthesia for
      valve surgery with minimal in hemodynamic, ST segment, and troponin I changes.

      The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of pre-induction administration
      of 0.07, 0.1, 0.15 mg/kg of ephedrine on heart rate (HR), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP),
      central venous and pulmonary artery occlusion pressures (CVP and PAOP, respectively), cardiac
      (CI), stroke volume (SVI), systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance (SVRI and PVRI,
      respectively), left and right ventricular stroke work (LVSWI and RVSWI, respectively)
      indices, ST segment, and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) changes in the patients anesthetized with
      propofol-fentanyl for valve surgery.

      action (effects on insulin secretion and insulin action); 3) its impact on weight (can it
      prevent insulin-associated weight gain or cause weight loss) and rates of hypoglycemia; 4) if
      it may improve specific plasma biomarkers of disease activity in NAFLD and inflammatory

NCT01007266,Partners for Better Health in Adolescent Type 2 Diabetes: The Buddy Study,"
      Background:

        -  Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is becoming more common among youth, particularly in
           minority populations. Few drug treatments are approved for T2DM in adolescents, and
           behavioral and lifestyle factors may contribute to their difficulties in following
           strict treatment regimens.

        -  It is unknown whether a minimally invasive patient partner ( buddy ) program, which has
           been developed to help improve diabetes control and quality of life, will be successful
           in a population of pediatric patients with T2DM.

      Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the effect of a minimally invasive intervention (being assigned a patient
           partner, or buddy ) on blood sugar levels in adolescents with T2DM.

        -  To assess changes between groups in body weight, number of home glucose monitor checks,
           compliance with medications, adherence to visit schedule, and psychological well-being.

      Eligibility:

      - Adolescents and young adults between 12 and 20 years of age who have been diagnosed with
      type 2 diabetes and whose blood glucose control needs improvement.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be divided by chance into two groups: in one group, participants will
           have a buddy and receive standard care; while in the other group, participants will
           receive standard care alone.

        -  The buddy is not a health care professional and is not authorized to provide any medical
           advice.

        -  Participants will be followed in the study for a total of 6 months. All study
           participants will receive standard treatment for T2DM.

        -  All patients will be asked to fill out a screening questionnaire (on paper or online) at
           the beginning of the study and a quality of life and eating behaviors questionnaire at
           the beginning and at the end of the study. These forms will include questions on medical
           history, emotions, well-being, and eating habits.

        -  Participants in both groups will have one diabetes clinic visit at the NIH Clinical
           Center or at Children s National Medical Center (CNMC) at the beginning of the study and
           two follow-up visits at the NIH or CNMC approximately 3 months apart. All visits include
           a physical examination, detailed medical history, and laboratory testing which is part
           of routine care for diabetes.

        -  Participants assigned to the buddy group will receive phone or online messages from the
           buddy once a week and will meet with the buddy once a month for less than 1 hour. The
           purpose of the in-person visit is to get to know each other better outside the usual
           hospital or clinic environment. The visits should take place at home, but may also take
           place elsewhere, for example, at schools, cafes, or libraries chosen by both the
           participant and the buddy. These face-to-face meetings may also take place at NIH or at
           CNMC if this is more convenient.

      An increase in cardiac biomarkers has been shown to occur in 5% to 30% of patients after
      otherwise successful percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs)(1) Apart from side-branch
      occlusion, intimal dissection and coronary spasm, a possible aetiology of myonecrosis after
      PCI might be distal embolization of atherogenic materials from plaque disruption,(2 )causing
      obstruction of blood flow at capillary level resulting in micro-infarction.(3,4 )Recent
      studies have suggested that pretreatment with Atorvastatin may be associated with a reduction
      in infarct size after elective PCI. (5-7 ).Actually the standard pretreatment in patients
      undergoing elective coronary-PCI and already treated with aspirin is copidogrel loading dose
      administration before procedure.(8,9 ) The investigators hypothesized that a high (40mg)
      loading dose of Rosuvastatin administered within 24h before the procedure may be effective in
      reducing the rate of periprocedural MI.Therefore, the investigators will conduct a single
      center,prospective randomized study to assess whether a single,high (40mg) loading

NCT01007968,Pharmacokinetics and Safety of Panobinostat in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors and Various Degrees of Hepatic Function,"
      Panobinostat (LBH589) is a deacetylase inhibitor (DACi) which belongs to a structurally novel
      cinnamic hydroxamic acid class of compounds. It is one of the most potent class I/II pan-DAC
      inhibitor (pan-DACi) that has shown anti-tumor activity in pre-clinical models and patients
      with solid tumors and hematological malignancies.

      To date, the pharmacokinetics (PK) of panobinostat has been characterized in patients with
      solid tumors and hematological malignancies participating in several phase I/II clinical
      studies. Panobinostat PK does not appear to be different in patients with solid tumors and
      hematological malignancies. However, the effect of organ dysfunction on PK of panobinostat is
      yet to be elucidated.

      Kidney and liver are involved in the elimination and metabolism of panobinostat. The current
      study is designed to evaluate the impact of hepatic function status on panobinostat PK.

      A specific group of neurons in the brain produces hypocretin, a peptide which has been
      established as an important regulator of sleep and wakefulness. Activation of these neurons
      (increased hypocretin) stabilizes wakefulness; impairing or blocking these neurons (decreased
      hypocretin) promotes sleep. Evidence suggests that these neurons may be involved in the
      hypnotic properties of several anesthetics, and play a role in the induction and emergence
      from anesthesia. In humans there is a considerable inter-individual variability in hypocretin
      levels. This study aims to investigate how hypocretin levels affect the anesthetic care and

      the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.
      Chemoembolization kills tumor cells by carrying drugs directly into the tumor and blocking
      the blood flow to the tumor. Everolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some
      of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. It is not yet

NCT01001182,Health Outcomes in Rheumatoid Arthritis in Greece,"
      Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is a chronic debilitating disease, causing severe pain and
      progressive joint destruction and leading to partial loss of mobility. The disease has a
      severe impact on patients' quality of life, due to the pain and physical impairment it
      causes, which can also result in psychological and social difficulties. Moreover, the chronic
      nature of the disease deems necessary the long-term use of medication, causing significant
      costs to the patient and the healthcare system. The decline in functional ability can cause
      problems at work, with reduced productivity or even unemployment. In addition, RA can limit
      the patients' ability for self-care, hence imposing a further burden on the patients'
      families and the society.

      Many international studies have confirmed the reduced quality of life for people suffering
      from RA [1-3], as well as the large economic impact of the disease on the patients, the
      health system and society [4-6]. However, no assessment of the above impact of RA on the
      Greek population has been published so far.

      A wide research of the literature confirms the relationship between costs and quality of life
      on the one hand and functional ability (as measured by the Health Assessment Questionnaire)
      on the other hand. [7-8] The impact of functional ability on quality of life is
      straightforward, however studies also demonstrate that as disease symptoms progress, without
      proper treatment, the overall costs undertaken by the patient or the healthcare system can
      rise significantly. On the other hand, if effective treatment can lessen or postpone the most
      serious consequences of the disease (such as extensive joint damage that could lead to
      surgical replacement), the savings on healthcare can offset some of the costs of the more
      effective drug therapies.

      In the light of the above findings, it seems important that in order to properly assess
      therapeutic strategies for RA patients it is necessary to have an accurate view of the total
      burden of RA on the population. It is also important to be able to establish a robust
      relationship between functional ability and impact of RA on costs and quality of life.

NCT01007695,Molecular Signature of Valproic Acid in Breast Cancer With Functional Imaging Assessment - a Pilot,"
      The investigators' hypothesis is that valproic acid given before surgery for newly diagnosed
      breast cancer will increase breast tumor histone acetylation at tolerable doses and that the
      increase in breast tumor histone acetylation will correlate with valproic acid blood levels
      and changes in peripheral blood white blood cell histone acetylation. Published in vitro
      studies have shown sensitivity of breast cancer cells to histone deacetylase inhibitors
      (Fortunati et al., 2008; Fuino et al., 2003; Hodges-Gallagher et al., 2007; Olsen et al.,
      2004). The investigators' gene array data predict sensitivity to valproic acid in over half
      of breast cancers [Bild, unpublished]. The investigators hypothesize that in women with newly
      diagnosed breast cancers valproic acid will have an unacceptable toxicity rate less than 15%
      at doses that increase tumor histone acetylation and that valproic acid will decrease the
      Ki-67 in at least half of breast tumors by over 20%. The investigators also hypothesize that
      their genomically-derived signature for sensitivity to valproic acid (GDSS-VPA) can be used
      to predict which tumors will have a decrease proliferation as measured by Ki-67 by at least
      20%. The investigators hypothesize that valproic acid levels and histone acetylation levels
      in peripheral leukocytes will correlate with a decrease in the Ki-67 proliferation index by
      20%. The investigators hypothesize that DCE-MRI imaging studies will provide an accurate and
      quantitative means of assessing tumor response to valproic acid. Finally, the investigators
      hypothesize that response to valproic acid will not be affected by intrinsic breast cancer
      subtype.

NCT01001871,Treatment of Iron Deficiency Anemia in Malaria Endemic Ghana,"
      Iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) are the most prevalent micronutrient
      deficiencies on a worldwide basis, especially in developing countries. The impact of severe
      IDA can have mortal consequences, since without adequate hemoglobin, the brain and body
      become deprived of oxygen and, if allowed to continue, death may ensue. It has been shown
      that iron supplementation in infants and young children can enhance child development,
      however, it may also result in increased rates of malaria in high burden areas.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine the impact of providing encapsulated iron
      (as a powder added to complementary foods) on the susceptibility to clinical malaria among
      anemic and non-anemic infants and young children (6-24 months of age) living in a high
      malaria burden area.

      The value of performing this research in Ghana is primarily that malaria and anemia remain

NCT01002729,Oseltamivir Pharmacokinetics in Morbid Obesity,"
      This trial asks the question: do people of much greater than average body weight need more of
      a drug called oseltamivir than current recommendations suggest. Oseltamivir is a drug given
      to people who have influenza, and currently is also being used to fight the new H1N1
      influenza. Some people of larger than average body weight require larger amounts of drugs to
      see the same effects as others of an average body weight. No studies have ever been conducted
      looking at the possibility of oseltamivir being one of those drugs. Our Study's hypothesis
      states that those of an above average body weight will have different amounts of drug in
      their blood than those of people of normal body weight if they are given the normal amount
      prescribed for influenza. Our study will give oseltamivir to twenty people for 7 days. Half
      of the people will be of normal body weight and the others will be of a much higher than
      normal body weight. Using blood samples the investigators will determine if the amounts of
      oseltamivir are significantly lower in the blood of patients in the above normal body weight

      Blood clots contribute to the death of at least 100,000 Americans each year. Because many of
      these deaths occur suddenly where treatment is impossible, the best treatment is prevention.
      With this grant, researchers in Missouri, New York, Utah, Illinois, and Texas are developing
      strategies to improve the safety and effectiveness of clot prevention by customizing a
      popular blood thinner (warfarin) to each person's genetic and clinical profile. They

NCT01004133,The Healthy Elderly Longevity Cohort,"
      With the completion of the human genome project, investigators can now explore new questions
      in human biology. Previously human genetics focused on highly penetrant, Mendelian traits;
      however, now rare and common variants can be discovered that affect ""common"" diseases that
      have multi-gene architecture with variable penetrance such as breast cancer, diabetes
      mellitus, and coronary artery disease. This change took place because investigators now have
      the tools to illuminate the whole genome at once to discover the genetic variants responsible
      for different disease phenotypes through statistical differences between populations. Besides
      disease phenotypes, health can be considered a human phenotype that can be studied. Health is
      not merely the absence of disease but may be viewed as a dynamic ongoing interplay between
      the environment and the genome to maintain homeostasis. Individuals often attempt to optimize
      environmental conditions according to ones genome to maximize their health. All individuals
      possess potentially beneficial and harmful variants depending on the environment. How this
      dynamic interplay occurs between the genome and environment requires understanding the
      boundary conditions of the genetic architecture of health and disease and then modeling the
      system to simulate the observed data.

      The aging process also affects health. Aging involves a loss of the normal coping responses
      to internal and external environmental stressors or signals. Investigators now have the tools
      to uncover from the bottom up the mechanisms involved in maintaining the ability to overcome
      environmental conditions that can affect health.

      Against this genomic breakthrough of whole genome association studies, the demographics in
      the United States are quickly changing. The older population (age > 65 years) in 2030 is
      projected to be twice as large as in 2000 representing nearly 20 percent of the total US
      population. The first baby boomers turn 65 in 2011 and will challenge all facets of health
      care in the coming decades. The demographic changes underscore the need to understand the
      mechanisms that promote health and disease in this cohort. Genomic discoveries will help
      individuals and may reduce medical costs and benefit society.

      In summary, the objective of this study is to obtain blood and/or saliva samples in order to
      help model health and disease phenotypes through population genomics. The blood and/or saliva
      samples may allow for participants' entire genomes to be sequenced if such comprehensive
      analysis becomes feasible and economical.

      The primary objective of this randomized phase II study is to compare the Response Rate of
      each sequence of treatment approach in patients with advanced NSCLC. Additionally,
      development of gene expression profiles and genotypes that can predict response to commonly
      used chemotherapy may provide a unique opportunity to better utilize drugs shown to be
      effective in first- or second-line therapy. Here, the investigators will conduct a
      pharmacogenomic study to provide rational approach to the treatment of NSCLC by developing
      predictors of cisplatin (first-line agent) and pemetrexed or docetaxel (second-line agents)
      sensitivity and demonstrating the clinical value of identifying the most appropriate drug on
      the basis of sensitivity profile for the treatment regimen of each individual patient. Such
      an approach is likely to maximize response to chemotherapy and may change the current
      empirical paradigm of NSCLC therapy.

NCT01003314,A Study of the Safety and Effectiveness of Two New Malaria Vaccines,"
      This study aims to test the safety of two new malaria vaccines AdCh63 MSP1 and MVA MSP1.
      These vaccines consist of inactivated viruses which have been modified - so they cannot
      reproduce (replicate) in humans, and also to include genetic material (genes) for malaria
      proteins which are expressed by the malaria parasite during blood stage infection. The
      vaccines are designed to stimulate an immune response to these malaria proteins
      (immunogenicity describes the nature and magnitude of this immune response), to provide
      protection against malaria infection. This protection has been demonstrated in nonhuman
      studies. Although these vaccines have not been given to humans before, similar vaccines using
      the same viruses with different malaria genes have been given to humans before. In these
      studies, the vaccines have been shown to be safe. They have also provided evidence from
      laboratory tests of immunogenicity. In this study the investigators main aim is to ensure
      these new vaccines given alone and in combination are safe. The investigators will increase
      the dose of the first vaccine (AdCh63 MSP1) given to volunteers if the initial dose is safe.
      The investigators also wish to ensure that challenging a small number of volunteers who have
      received both vaccines with malaria infection from the bites of infected mosquitos(sporozoite
      challenge) is safe. Sporozoite challenge has been widely used in humans to test the
      effectiveness of malaria vaccines and is considered a well established, reliable, predictable
      and safe system.In the study the investigators will also look for evidence of immunogenicity
      of these new vaccines, and whether there is any delay to developing malaria following
      sporozoite challenge. The study will be conducted at the University of Oxfords Centre for
      Clinical Vaccinology and Tropical Medicine (CCVTM). The challenge part of the study will take
      place at the insectary at Imperial College, (Infection and Immunity Section)in London.

NCT01008501,Study of the Genetic and Epigenetic Causes of Recurrent Hydatidiform Moles,"
      The researchers' laboratory is studying a rare class of highly recurrent hydatidiform moles.
      These are usually complete hydatidiform moles (CHM), but sometimes they are partial
      hydatidiform moles PHM). With sporadic moles, the difference between CHMs and PHMs is that
      with CHMS, there is not typically an embryo or fetus at the time of diagnosis but with a PHM
      there may be a fetus. Also, CHMs have 46 chromosomes in each cell. While this is the number
      of chromosomes that should be found, the problem is that all the chromosomes come from the
      father. Normally, half the chromosomes should come from the mother and half should come from
      the father. Unlike CHMs, PHMs have 69 chromosomes. This means that PHMs have three copies of
      each chromosome when they should only have two. The extra copy comes from the father.

      The researchers' study focuses on moles that are genetically different from these sporadic
      moles in that they have 23 chromosomes from the mother and 23 chromosomes from the father -
      just like a normally developing pregnancy. These are called biparental moles because the
      mutation that causes the mole comes from both parents. This mutation occurs in a gene called
      NLRP7. The researchers' team is working to understand how mutations in NLRP7 leads to CHMs
      and how these mutations may lead to other types of pregnancy loss. The researchers are also
      trying to discover other genetic and epigenetic factors that may lead to moles.

      Levocetirizine (Xyzal®), the active levorotatory enantiomer of cetirizine (Zyrtec®), is a
      FDA-approved drug used in the treatment of symptoms associated with seasonal and perennial
      allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria. The parent compound, cetirizine was shown
      to be effective against experimental dermatographism, however no study has been conducted so
      far on the effect of levocetirizine on the inhibition of dermatographism. It is known that
      cetirizine is a mast-cell stabilizer and decreases histamine levels and the number of
      tryptase positive mast cells. Cetirizine inhibits the production of interleukin 8 (IL8) and
      leukotriene B4 (LTB4) by immune cells - two potent chemoattractants - and induces the release
      from monocytes of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a suppressor of antigen presentation and MHC class
      II expression. However, the effects of the most active enantiomer levocetirizine on these
      inflammatory mediators have not been evaluated so far. Therefore, we aim to conduct a study
      in humans with dermatographism and chronic idiopathic urticaria to evaluate the effect of
      levocetirizine on the above-mentioned mediators. The study will involve the use of skin

NCT01009372,The Intermittent Pneumoperitoneum Scheme of Work Breaks in Complex Laparoscopic Surgery,"
      Many people spanning from air traffic controllers to simple production line workers share
      regular compulsive breaks to revert fatigue whilst they work. This is uncommon for medical
      operators - a macho image is still as prevalent in real life as it is in countless TV series.

      We report on the first clinical trial on regular intraoperative breaks. For one time we
      turned our scientific curiosity to ourselves. This included the intraoperative collection of
      body fluids and required transparency which was not easy to obtain. It was rewarded with
      striking results: Regular intraoperative breaks lowered significantly the operators stress
      hormone levels, improved error-performance testing results and musculoskeletal fatigue
      scores. Subjectively the breaks enhanced the practitioners satisfaction.

      Surprisingly the operator's breaks were not at the cost of the patient: because the did not
      prolong the overall operation time at all and - in our setting- they significantly increased
      of cardiac output and urine production.

NCT01000714,Determination of the Efficacy and Safety of Psirelax in the Relief of the Disease in Psoriasis,"
      Psoriasis is a chronic disorder characterized by erythematous scaly patches which affect the
      scalp, trunk, extensor surfaces of the limbs and the genital area. The common form of
      psoriasis is referred to as psoriasis vulgaris. There are several variants of psoriasis such
      as guttate psoriasis, inverse psoriasis, pustular psoriasis and erythrodermic psoriasis.

      Psoriasis is highly prevalent in the general population, mainly as a result of its chronicity
      and the absence of a cure. The estimates of psoriasis prevalence are within the range of 0.5%
      to 4%.

      The diagnosis of psoriasis is made on a clinical base, usually by physical examination,
      performed by a dermatologist. Although skin biopsy may be useful in some cases, there is no
      laboratory test which may serve as a reference standard to the clinical diagnosis of
      psoriasis.

      Psoriasis in its mild cases per se is not associated with excess mortality, however, the
      disease may affect quality of life of affected patients to a substantial degree. Psoriasis
      may be readily apparent to others because of scales and redness of the skin. The skin may
      itch and scales may shed from the patients to the environment or directly on other people.
      Feelings of stigmatization and major changes in life-style caused by psoriasis have been
      documented in numerous studies. The burden of the disease may be exaggerated due to expensive
      therapy and complicated therapeutic regimes Patients with mild to moderate psoriasis are
      usually treated with topical treatments. Photo-therapy or systemic treatments are reserved to
      patients with moderate to severe disease.

      Topical corticosteroids may lead to rapid improvement in psoriasis, however rapid relapse
      following discontinuation is the common practice leading to chronic use.

      Calcipotriene ointment may also be used and requires 8 to 12 weeks of use for maximal effect
      and often causes local irritation, particularly when used on the face. The use is limited to
      100 gr/week due to hypercalcemia that might follow systemic absorption.

      Vitamin A derivative tazarotene may be also be used for plaque psoriasis. Although it can
      produce longer remissions than topical steroids, local irritation, cost, and teratogenicity
      limit its use.

      Coal tar products may be used as steroid-sparing agents, especially useful for enhancing the
      efficacy of natural sunlight and phototherapy. Application can be cumbersome because of
      irritation, unpleasant smell, brown color that can stain clothing, and propensity to cause
      folliculitis.

      All of the above treatments are particularly problematic for the face and genital psoriasis
      due to the potential side effects and mainly possible severe irritation reducing patients
      compliance.

      Psirelax is a novel topical medication directed for the treatment of patients with psoriasis.
      The formulation of Psirelax includes the following substances: 5%-15% quince seeds jelly,
      10%-40% natural base cream (e.g. Ferntree Cottage Pure Base Cream), 55%-75% mixture of
      natural anti-oxidants (e.g. Vitamin E, wheat germ oil, Safflower oil), natural skin softening
      agents (e.g. sweet almond oil, sesame oil), natural absorption aids (e.g. jojoba oil,
      vegetable squalene), natural tissue regenerating and protecting agents (e.g. grape seed oil,
      sunflower oil), natural preservatives (e.g. paraben, tea trea essential oil, thyme essential
      oil, grapefruit seed extract, Vitamin E) and natural thickening agents (e.g. bee wax,
      aloevera, medicinal Vaseline, coconut oil, guar gum, palm oil, borax)

      In a preliminary observation, a patient with severe psoriasis applied Psirelax three times
      each day during four days. The patient reported complete disappearance of the psoriatic
      plaques and pruritus was reduced by 70%. It was suggested to conduct an open study to assess
      the effect of Psirelax in patients with psoriasis vulgaris.

      The aim of this study is to examine the safety and efficacy of Psirelax in the treatment of
      psoriasis.

NCT01003535,Quantification of Cerebral Cholinergic Function in Parkinson´s Disease by Means of Nuclear Medicine Methods,"
      Parkinson´s disease is based on a Lewy body degeneration of cerebral and extracerebral
      neurons. This Lewy body degeneration includes cerebral cholinergic neurons besides
      dopaminergic neurons.

      In previous studies the investigators found that some clinical parkinsonian symptoms -
      primarily hypokinesia and rigidity - significantly correlate with the dopaminergic
      nigrostriatal degeneration which was quantified by dopamine transporter imaging. In contrast
      to that, resting or postural parkinsonian tremor does not correlate with the dopaminergic
      nigrostriatal degeneration. Obviously further cerebral changes - for instance possible
      changes / degeneration of cerebral cholinergic neurons - contribute to parkinsonian tremor.

      In this study the investigators apply cerebral 5-IA-85380-SPECT to quantify the local density
      of cerebral nicotinergic cholinergic receptors in patients with Parkinson´s disease. The
      investigators will correlate the results of cerebral 5-IA-85380-SPECT with the clinical
      parkinsonian main symptoms hypokinesia, rigidity and primarily resting and postural tremor.
      In particular, it is of interest whether changes of cerebral cholinergic neurons are involved
      in the generation of parkinsonian tremor.

      Objective: To what extend should a possible worsening of the OSA condition, caused by an
      increase of mouth opening be taken into consideration in daily dental practice, when an
      occlusal stabilization splint (OSS) is placed in the mouth.

      Study design: Cross over RCT-design Study population: OSA patients referred to ACTA from the
      Slotervaart Hospital, for treatment with a Mandibular Advancement Device (MAD), at least 18
      years old.

      Intervention: Occlusal stabilization splint (OSS) for the upper jaw and a controlled
      condition in a cross-over design Main study parameters/endpoints: Apnoea- Hypopnoea Index
      (AHI) and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS).

      The aim of this study is to determine the effect of vertical dimension of OS on sleep and
      respiratory variables in OSA patients. The hypothesis is that insertion of an OSS and an
      increase of the vertical dimension will result in a significant increase in the AHI.

      increased intestinal permeability in patients of IBS,and abnormal tissue resistance in NERD.
      Although the mucosa of Functional dyspepsia (FD) patients is endoscopically and
      histologically ""normal,"" it contains ultrastructural changes, activated immune cells, along
      with evidence of an increased release of mediators leading to gastric dysfunction. There is
      now consistent evidence indicating that mucosal barrier defects allow the passage of an
      increased load of bacteria, antigens and toxins which, in turn evoke activation of mucosal
      immune responses involved in the FD symptom.

NCT01001676,Restenosis Following Paclitaxel Eluting Balloon Angioplasty of Hemodialysis Access Stenosis,"
      Introduction: Narrowing of the draining vein occurs in >50% of hemodialysis fistula and left
      untreated will lead to loss of access. The narrowing is due to excessive growth of tissue in
      the vessel wall (intimal hyperplasia). The standard treatment is balloon dilatation. However,
      narrowing will inevitably recur in 2-3 months hence requiring further dilatation. Intimal
      hyperplasia also occurs in the heart and leg circulation. The drug paclitaxel has been used
      with great success in preventing intimal hyperplasia in these vessels following balloon
      dilatation. Administer locally, paclitaxel inhibits excess tissue growth in the vessel wall.
      The investigators believe that this drug will have similar effect in hemodialysis access..

      Objective: To assess the effect of paclitaxel in hemodialysis access with narrowing.
      Paclitaxel is delivered by a paclitaxel-coated balloon. This balloon dilates the narrow
      segment and simultaneously delivers paclitaxel to the vessel wall.

      Methodology: Patients with narrowed hemodialysis access are dilated with the
      paclitaxel-coated balloon or conventional balloon in randomized manner. The patency of the
      two groups are evaluated and compared at 6 months follow-up.

NCT01006434,Weight Approximation in Stroke Before Thrombolysis,"
      Thrombolysis using Alteplase (tPA) is still the only approved specific therapy for acute
      ischemic stroke (AIS). Current guidelines in western countries recommend an tPA dose of
      0.9mg/kg up to a maximum dose of 90mg for patients weighing more than 100kg. However, larger
      dose-finding rtPA trials for intravenous thrombolysis in AIS are missing. Based on results
      from research on myocardial infarction only a few open label studies with low case rates were
      initiated to evaluate the optimal dose for tPA in cerebral ischemia. These studies suggested
      a narrow therapeutic range with decreased efficacy in lower dosages and an increased risk for
      thrombolysis related intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) at doses above 0.95mg/kg. The ECASS-1
      trial which used a dosage of 1.1mg/kg rt-PA showed significantly higher rate of large
      parenchymal hemorrhages compared to trials using 0.9mg/kg. Therefore accurate dosing is
      crucial. In the acute phase two aspects complicate rtPA dosing in AIS: First, unlike in other
      diseases many stroke patients are unable to communicate information on their body weight (BW)
      because of their stroke symptoms (e.g. aphasia, decreased consciousness). In addition motor
      symptoms prohibit easy weighing procedures in many patients. Second, the ultra-early and
      narrow time window for treatment does not allow time loss to weigh each patient in the
      emergency situation. Therefore routinely the attending physician has to make a visual
      estimation of the patient's BW. This may be inaccurate and may cause dosing errors which has
      been shown for other weight based emergency medication. There is little data on tPA-dosing
      errors in stroke patients and prospective data are lacking. The aim of our study is to
      evaluate availability of BW-information, accuracy of estimations and final dosing of tPA in a
      routine clinical setting. Therefore the investigators evaluate different sources of body
      weight estimations and also compare visual estimation with recently proposed anthropometric
      measurements for body weight approximation. Finally, impact of dosing errors on safety and
      efficacy are analyzed.

      The initial phase will consist of 100 enrolled patients as a pilot phase for further power
      calculations. Based on the results of the pilot phase enrollment will continue. The
      envisioned inclusion target is up to 800 patients.

NCT01006538,Macular EpiRetinal Brachytherapy Versus Lucentis® Only Treatment (MERLOT),"
      Wet age-related macular degeneration is the most common cause of blind registration in the
      United Kingdom (UK). Standard treatment involves regular eye injections of a drug called
      ranibizumab (Lucentis). For most patients, ranibizumab maintains their vision but the effect
      of the drug is temporary, and they therefore require monthly hospital visits and typically
      six injections into the eye every year, probably for life.

      This study tests a new surgical device that delivers a focal dose of radiation (epimacular
      brachytherapy) to the macula (the part inside the back of the eye that gives fine central
      vision), to try and reduce or eliminate the need for ongoing, regular eye injections. The
      trial compares epimacular brachytherapy to ongoing standard treatment with ranibizumab.

      Whereas most studies of this new surgical device target patients who have not yet commenced
      any treatment, this study targets those who are requiring frequent eye injections, as there
      are limited surgical resources and these resources are best directed to those who have not
      fully responded to ranibizumab therapy, or whose response is shortlived. These patients have
      the most to gain from a device that may reduce their burden of treatment. The findings in
      untreated disease cannot be extrapolated to this discrete subset of patients, hence the need
      for a study that targets refractory disease.

      It is hypothesised that epimacular brachytherapy will reduce the frequency of Lucentis®
      (ranibizumab) re-treatment that patients require, whilst maintaining visual acuity.

NCT01006382,Adherence to Self-care Regimens for Young People With Food Allergy,"
      Anaphylaxis is a severe and potentially life threatening allergic reaction which can affect
      the airway, breathing and/or circulation. This reaction can be triggered by a number of
      different allergens but the most common are food, medications, insect venom and latex.
      Because these reactions occur suddenly and are potentially very serious, the best management
      lies in the correct use of the prescribed emergency medication. Epinephrine, or adrenaline as
      it is more commonly known, is the recommended drug for the treatment of anaphylaxis.
      Injecting the epinephrine into the outer thigh muscle is the preferred route of
      administration. For health professionals, patients and carers, this rapid administration is
      facilitated by the manufacture of preloaded syringes and autoinjectors. Despite the
      availability of these devices, a review of studies shows poor knowledge and skills amongst
      both health professionals and patients with regards to using autoinjectable epinephrine
      devices correctly. These studies found that as well as poor knowledge in using the
      autoinjectors, there was a lack of confidence amongst patients and an unwillingness to carry
      the device with them at all times.

      In other disease groups like asthma and diabetes, psychological models which involve asking
      people how they think about their illness and their related behaviours, have been found to
      help in the understanding of why some people follow or adhere to health professionals advice
      and why others do not. Based on these findings, this study will look at two appropriate
      psychological models and their ability to predict variation in adherence to self-care
      regimens in adolescents and young adults with food allergy related anaphylaxis.

NCT01005836,Community Clinic Test of Youth Anxiety Treatment,"
      Structured, manualized treatments have been developed for numerous mental health problems and
      disorders among children and adolescents, and a number of these have shown strong beneficial
      effects in clinical trials. Such findings have led to proposals that the empirically
      supported treatments be used to improve outcomes of conventional clinic treatment, which some
      research suggests may not be very effective. But can these lab-tested treatments actually
      work in service-oriented clinics with referred youth? Available evidence cannot tell us,
      because the therapists, conditions, and clientele in the laboratory efficacy tests tend to
      differ so markedly from those of clinical practice. To assess the clinical potential of
      efficacy-tested treatments, we need effectiveness research that tests these treatments in the
      crucible of clinical practice. To help begin this process, the proposed research focuses on a
      specific treatment program for a specific cluster of disorders: Kendall's (1994)
      cognitive-behavioral ""Coping Cat"" program for child and adolescent anxiety disorders. The
      program has shown unusually positive effects across a series of clinical trials in the U.S.
      and Australia, but it has never been tested in real-world clinical conditions. The proposed
      study will test the effectiveness of the treatment with clinic-referred youth, treated in
      community clinics, with the treatment carried out by clinic staff therapists. Some 128 youth,
      aged 9-14, referred for anxiety and diagnosed with anxiety disorders, will be randomly
      assigned to receive either the usual treatment in the clinic, or the Kendall program, carried
      out by clinic staff who have been trained to proficiency. Therapists for the two treatment
      conditions will also be chosen randomly, from a pool of volunteers. Outcome assessment at
      immediate post-treatment, 1-year, and 2-year follow-ups, will test effects across many
      outcomes. It is hypothesized that outcomes for youths treated using the cognitive-behavioral
      treatment will be superior to those treated using usual care.

NCT01005602,Digoxin Dosing in Heart Failure: A Simplified Nomogram Versus Standard Care,"
      Dosing methods for digoxin, a drug used to treat heart failure, have not been updated in
      decades despite evidence in recent years suggesting that blood levels of digoxin achieved
      with traditional dosing practices may increase the risk of adverse events. We developed a
      simple dosing tool that targets lower blood levels of digoxin that have been associated with
      improved outcomes compared to higher blood levels. The aim of this study is to determine if
      this simplified dosing tool is more effective than standard digoxin dosing practices at
      achieving lower blood levels and also to determine if digoxin dosing may be further optimized
      by incorporating patients' genetic information believed to influence the drug's properties.

NCT01005589,CD64 Measurement in Neonatal Infection and Necrotising Enterocolitis,"
      Bacterial infections are a major cause of death in newborn infants. And are linked to
      complications including: sepsis (an over exaggerated immune response to infection) and
      necrotising enterocolitis (a potentially fatal inflammatory bowel disease).

      Detecting infections at an early stage is difficult in newborns as the signs and symptoms can
      be non-specific, the most commonly used lab test is to culture a sample of blood, urine or
      spinal fluid to try and grow and identify any bacteria that is present; however these tests
      take 24-48 hours to give results, and this means that neonates who present with signs of
      infection are prescribed broad spectrum antibiotics whilst results are obtained.

      The lack of a test that can detect infection at an early stage and give rapid results is one
      of the major problems in the diagnosis and management of infection in newborns. This study
      will investigate neutrophils, which are white blood cells that are important in fighting
      infection. When neutrophils detect and infection they become activated, and produce a protein
      called CD64 (a cell marker) on their surface, and it is this protein that we want to measure.
      Neutrophils produce the CD64 protein within 1 hour of first detecting an infection, so we
      could hopefully detect and treat infections much quicker.

      The hypothesis this study will test are:

        1. Does neutrophil membrane CD64 measurement provide a highly sensitive and specific marker
           of infection in neonates AND:

        2. Does neutrophil membrane CD64 measurement provide a highly sensitive and specific marker

NCT01008982,Efficacy and Safety of Belimumab in Primary Sjögren's Syndrome,"
      Background and rationale Sjögren's syndrome (SS) is a systemic autoimmune disease
      characterized by chronic inflammation of salivary and lachrymal glands, frequently
      accompanied by systemic symptoms. The presence of various autoantibodies such as rheumatoid
      factor (RF) and anti-SSA/SSB antibodies, as well as hypergammaglobulinemia, reflect B cell
      hyperactivity. About five percent of patients with SS develop malignant B cell lymphoma,
      usually of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) type and most frequently located in
      the major salivary glands. Currently, there is a lack of evidence-based intervention therapy
      which may influence SS-related chronic inflammation and lymphoproliferation. B cells are
      involved in the pathogenesis of SS, and B cell downregulation may lead to a decrease of
      disease activity. Patients with more residual exocrine gland function, e.g., those with SS of
      shorter duration, might better benefit from systemic therapy, as reported in a preliminary
      study on the efficacy of B-cell depletion in SS.This study will examine the effect of the
      drug Belimumab in patients with SS. Patients aged more than 18 years with SS may be eligible

      Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy (DMD/BMD) is a genetic disorder that develops in boys. It
      is caused by a mutation in the gene for dystrophin, a protein that is important for
      maintaining normal muscle structure and function. Loss of dystrophin causes muscle fragility
      that leads to weakness and loss of walking ability during childhood and teenage years. A
      specific type of mutation, called a nonsense (premature stop codon) mutation is the cause of
      DMD/BMD in approximately 10-15% of boys with the disease. Ataluren (PTC124) is an orally
      delivered, investigational drug that has the potential to overcome the effects of the
      nonsense mutation. This study is a Phase 2a trial that enrolled boys with nonsense mutation

      Background: the best method used today to supervise the labor process is to follow cervix
      dilatation and head station. Today, the physician or the midwife use manual examination to
      estimate cervix dilatation and head station. This examination is perform many times in a
      normal labor process, and even more if there is any delay. The information from these
      examinations is inaccurate and non-continuous. In case of delay in the labor process, the
      delay will diagnosed late, because the frequency of the manual examination is about once an
      hour.

      Primary Objective: Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicity
      (DLT) of MR1-1KDEL when delivered intracerebrally by convection-enhanced delivery (CED) in
      patients with supratentorial malignant brain tumors.

      Secondary Objective: Document any radiographic responses associated with intracerebral CED of
      MR1-1KDEL.

      Hypothesis: The investigators believe that MR1-1KDEL will be an effective anti-tumor agent
      for patients with supratentorial malignant brain tumors when delivered by CED.

      Design & procedures: This protocol is designed primarily to determine the MTD and DLT of a
      novel, tumor-specific immunotoxin, MR1-1KDEL. MR1-1KDEL will be delivered intracerebrally by
      CED using 2 intracerebral catheters with at least one catheter placed within the enhancing
      portion of the tumor. 124I-labeled albumin will be co-infused with gadolinium and PET and MRI
      images will be obtained at the conclusion of the infusion to monitor volume of drug
      distribution and leakage into the CSF space.

      Based on preclinical toxicity studies, the starting total drug dose will be 0.5μg (500ng)
      which represents 1/20th of the MTD in rats. The infusion flow rate will be fixed at 0.5 mL/h
      from each of two to four catheters. A total of 144 mLs of drug solution will be delivered
      over 72 hours. MR1-1KDEL dose escalation will be accomplished by increasing drug
      concentration allowing flow rate and infusion volume to remain unchanged. Drug dose will be
      doubled in successive cohorts so long as DLTs are not observed as follows: 25 ng/mL (2.4
      μg)(starting dose); 50ng/mL (4.8μg); 100 ng/mL (9.6μg); 200ng/mL (19.2μg); 400 ng/mL
      (38.4μg); 800 ng/mL (76.8μg); and 1600 ng/mL (153.6μg). At least 3 patients will be enrolled
      in each cohort. All patients in a given cohort will be observed for at least two weeks
      following infusion of the study drug before patients in the next cohort are treated. If no
      patients in a given cohort experience a DLT, the dose will be escalated in the next cohort.
      If 1 out of 3 patients in a given cohort experience DLT, 3 additional patients will be
      entered in that cohort. If 2 patients develop a DLT in any cohort of 3 or 6 patients, the
      previous dose will be declared the MTD. Patients will be followed at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 month
      intervals for toxicity and adverse events, radiographic response, and survival. Patients will
      be off study when progressive disease is documented.

      Clomiphene citrate (CC) is the first-line therapy for infertile women with polycystic ovary
      syndrome (PCOS). Unfortunately, at least 20% of PCOS results are not responsive to CC.
      Structured exercise training (SET) and diet has been successfully employed to restore ovarian
      function and to improve reproductive outcomes in obese and overweight women with PCOS. The
      current study was aimed to test the hypothesis that a short-term SET program plus diet
      intervention can improve the ovarian response to CC in CC-resistant PCOS patients.

NCT01004900,Intraocular Pressure (IOP) Lowering Effect of Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty Versus Prostaglandin Analogues in Angle Closure Glaucoma,"
      Glaucoma affects 66 million people worldwide and is the leading cause of irreversible
      blindness, and Primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG) is a major form of glaucoma in Asia.

      Laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI) has been advocated as the first line treatment in all cases
      of PACG. In addition to relieving the relative pupil block element of the condition, it can
      open up the drainage angle, alleviating appositional and synechial angle-closure and in the
      long-term this may control intraocular pressure (IOP) and prevent progression of glaucomatous
      optic neuropathy. However recent data indicate that iridotomy is not successful in
      controlling IOP in the long term, and the majority of cases develop a clinically significant
      rise in IOP requiring medical therapy or surgery.

      Laser trabeculoplasty has been a recognized treatment option for Primary open angle glaucoma
      (POAG) since the 1980s. Recently a more selective and less destructive method of performing
      laser trabeculoplasty has evolved. Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty (SLT) specifically targets
      the pigmented trabecular meshwork cells without producing collateral damage and destruction
      to adjacent structures. Morphologic study performed on human autopsy eyes treated with SLT
      noted no structural or collateral thermal damage to the trabecular beams in the uveal and
      corneoscleral meshwork. As SLT specifically has its effect on the targeted pigmented
      trabecular meshwork it is unlikely to generate PAS. It may be a useful treatment option for
      PACG patients in whom the angle has widened following laser peripheral iridotomy.

      The proposed study is a randomized controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of SLT in
      reducing IOP in cases of PACG in which the angle has opened up following LPI, but IOP remains
      high(>21 mmHg). 100 subjects will be randomized to receive either SLT or medical treatment to
      achieve IOP control. They will be followed up for 6 months.

NCT01008176,Restoring Sleep Homeostasis to Lower Blood Pressure,"
      Cutting back on sleep duration has developed into a common, highly prevalent habit in the
      adult population, and may lead to a major health problem. Large epidemiological studies have
      demonstrated that short sleep duration is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular
      disease (CVD). The investigators' preliminary data on the effects of experimental sleep
      reduction have shown elevation of blood pressure (BP) and inflammatory markers, such as
      interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C reactive protein (CRP), suggesting that both may play an important
      role in linking sleep loss and CVD risk. With this background, the investigators hypothesize
      that restoring sleep homeostasis, i. e. getting adequate amounts of sleep, is an effective
      behavioral intervention in the treatment of elevated BP.

      The investigators will test this hypothesis in subjects with BP above normal and with short
      habitual sleep duration, as verified by sleep logs and actigraphic recordings. Subjects will
      either undergo 6 weeks of mild sleep extension, in which 60 min of bedtime will be added to
      the habitual sleep duration, or subjects will maintain their habitual sleep duration for the
      following 6 weeks.

      Regarding their first specific aim, the investigators expect that sleep extension across 6
      weeks will lower BP, inflammatory (IL-6, CRP, cell adhesion molecules) and autonomic markers
      (catecholamines). In particular, the investigators expect that in subjects with mild BP
      elevation, i. e. with pre-hypertension, sleep extension leads to normalization of BP.

      This study presents a very first approach in using sleep behavior components for the
      treatment of elevated BP. Therefore, the investigators' second specific aim will characterize
      the strength of associations between changes in sleep duration, BP, and inflammation, and
      they will explore factors that are predictive for these changes. In particular, adiposity, as
      measured by percent body fat, has frequently been shown to be related to short sleep duration
      and inflammatory processes, but the role of adiposity in modulating the physiological
      consequences of changes in sleep duration has never been addressed.

      If the investigators' hypothesis is correct, sleep extension may be considered as an
      additional component in current lifestyle intervention programs in combating and preventing
      hypertension.

      dust from the patient's own bone pieces, versus bone dust alone in filling in the gaps that
      sometimes occur after surgery for craniosynostosis . We will compare the percent of defect
      filled at 1 year in 5 patients 18 months or older with metopic craniosynostosis that received
      the bone substitute plus their bone dust with 5 previously operated patients with similar
      characteristics that received bone dust alone to fill in the gaps. The bone substitute that
      we are using will be provided at no cost by the company Biomet Microfixation. The bone
      substitute Allogenix Plus undergoes extensive screening for infectious diseases as well as
      processing to prevent a rejection. The product will be applied during standard surgery to 5
      patients with metopic craniosynostosis of 18 months or older with skull defects no larger
      than 25 cm2, so it does not require any additional surgeries. Aside from the placement of
      this bone substitute the patient will proceed to receive the standard of care which includes
      a pre-operative CT scan, immediate post-operative CT scan, and 1 year post-operative CT scan
      of the Head. We will review these scans and look at percent of bony growth in the bone

      Background: Variceal bleeding is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with
      Non Cirrhotic Portal Hypertension (NCPH). Beta blockers (BB) and endoscopic variceal ligation
      (EVL) have been used to prevent rebleeding in these patients, largely based on data from
      cirrhotic patients. Endotherapy in the form of EST has been well studied in preventing
      rebleed in patients with NCPH. Initial studies showed that EST significantly reduced the
      rebleeding rate in patients of NCPH. Data from these studies suggests a rebleed rate of
      approximately 25% at 2yr and 35% at 5 years.

      Beta blockers have been found to be quite effective in both primary as well as secondary
      prophylaxis of variceal bleeding in cirrhotic and are accepted mode of treatment. In contrast
      to liver cirrhosis, published data on the effect of beta blocker therapy on NCPH are scanty.
      Animal data and human data suggests that beta blockers reduce portal pressure in patients
      with NCPH. In two placebo controlled trials of propranolol on secondary prophylaxis of
      variceal bleeding in non cirrhotic patients. both studies demonstrated the efficacy of
      propranolol in decreasing rebleed rate. However, no comparisons hae been made with EVL till
      date.

      Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesis that In patients with NCPH, treatment with beta
      blockers will lead to reduction in portal pressure and decrease in portosystemic shunting
      leading to reduction in variceal rebleeding Aim of the study: Aim: To compare the efficacy

NCT01006616,"Long-Term Study of the Effects of Navarixin (SCH 527123, MK-7123) in Participants With Moderate to Severe COPD (MK-7123-019)","
      Neutrophils are thought to play an important role in the pathophysiology of chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Navarixin (SCH 527123, MK-7123) is an antagonist of the
      cysteine-X-cysteine chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2) and is thought to reduce neutrophil
      migration to the diseased lung. It is theorized that reducing neutrophil migration to the
      diseased lung will improve a participant's symptoms and the natural history of the disease.

      The study will consist of a 2-week screening period followed by a 2-year (104-week)
      double-blind treatment period. The 2-year Treatment Period will be made up of two phases: a
      26-week (6-month) dose range-finding phase with 3 active arms and 1 placebo arm (Period 1),
      followed by a 78-week (18-month) long-term safety and efficacy phase (Period 2). Participants
      participating in the original 6-month study (Period 1) may elect not to continue into the
      18-month extension study (Period 2).

      Hypothesis: navarixin, 50 mg, or the highest remaining dose if the 50-mg dose is
      discontinued, is superior to placebo with respect to improving airflow.

NCT01003353,Strength Training for Chronic Stroke Patients,"
      The study aims to investigate the effects of strength training on maximal strength, walking
      ability and neural function in chronic stroke patients. The strength training intervention in
      this study is different to all previous interventions for stroke patients.

      Maximal Strength Training (MST) involves weights of up to 90% of the participants 1
      repetition maximum and has a focus on the explosive development of force. This study will use
      these principles for unilateral leg press and plantarflexion exercises. Only 2 previous
      studies have investigated high intensity strength training for stroke patients and they used
      intensities of 80% 1RM. Previous MST interventions have shown large increases in strength,
      rate of force development and this has transferred to improved walking economy.

      The investigators predict that MST will give large increases in strength, improved rate of
      force development (RFD) and walking economy. The investigators expect that better neural
      function will account for the improvements. This study could provide evidence for the
      adoption of a completely different method of strength rehabilitation for stroke survivors.

NCT01002053,Can Ultrasound Predict Nerve Injury Following Posterior Tibial Nerve Block in Patients With Peripheral Neuropathy?,"
      The use of regional anesthesia for nerve block in diabetic patients with peripheral
      neuropathy is currently made on a case-by-case basis, also remains underlying uncertainty
      regarding the preferred technique and the likelihood of block-related nerve injury. For this
      many diabetic patients with otherwise healthy nerves may receive general anesthesia instead
      of regional anesthesia, thus giving up the benefits associated with the latter technique,
      including a decrease in health complications and superior analgesia following the operation.
      Ultrasound is used to identify the target nerve and guide needle insertion for nerve blocks,
      may be a useful tool to detect the presence and severity of neuropathy prior to block
      placement, a recent study demonstrated a statistically significant increase in the
      sonographic cross-sectional area of the posterior tibial nerve (PTN) in all diabetic patients
      who had abnormal motor transmission on nerve conduction studies. For regional
      anesthesiologists, the ultimate goal of detecting peripheral neuropathy and in particular,
      diabetic neuropathy by US is to avoid nerve injury. To do so, the association between
      US-detected diabetic neuropathy and block-related nerve damage must be first established,
      hence the purpose of this study. We aim to examine whether the cross-sectional area of PTN as
      assessed by preoperative US can predict nerve injury as assessed by worsening nerve
      conduction studies following PTN block inpatients scheduled to receive an ankle block. A
      further subgroup analysis will be performed in diabetic patients.

      We hypothesize that the cross sectional area of the PTN will correlate with motor conduction
      velocity on nerve conduction studies (NCS) following PTN block in patients with peripheral
      neuropathy. All eligible patients will undergo NCS to confirm or exclude distal neuropathy.
      Patients without neuropathy will be excluded from further participation in this study. Also
      excluded will be diabetic patients with neuropathy caused by genetic, metabolic and
      inflammatory diseases as well as toxic agents and drug induced. A systematic US examination
      of the PTN will be performed for all patients. After Block administration at surgery day the
      block successes will be assessed and for the purposes of the present study, patients in whom
      the block was not successful will be excluded from further intervention and data analyses.
      Eight weeks after surgery, all study patients will return to hospital for repeat NCS and US.

NCT01004978,Chemoembolization With or Without Sorafenib Tosylate in Treating Patients With Liver Cancer That Cannot Be Removed by Surgery,"
      This randomized phase III trial studies chemoembolization and sorafenib tosylate to see how
      well they work compared with chemoembolization alone in treating patients with liver cancer
      that cannot be removed by surgery. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin
      hydrochloride, mitomycin, and cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor
      cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from
      spreading. Chemoembolization kills tumor cells by carrying drugs directly into blood vessels
      near the tumor and then blocking the blood flow to allow a higher concentration of the drug
      to reach the tumor for a longer period of time. Sorafenib tosylate may stop the growth of
      tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet known
      whether giving chemoembolization together with sorafenib tosylate is more effective than
      chemoembolization alone in treating patients with liver cancer.

      Up to 40% of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) patients do not respond to conventional
      treatments (medications or behavior therapy). For some of them, a neurosurgical treatment can
      be indicated. Among various surgical techniques, Gamma Knife radiosurgery has the advantage
      of not requiring the production of burr hole openings in the skull. However, there are no
      randomized controlled trials of radiosurgical procedures.

      The investigators' aim is to investigate whether radiosurgery for the treatment of severe and
      refractory OCD is efficacious and safe, by a double-blind, randomized controlled trial.
      Forty-eight refractory OCD patients will be randomized into two different groups: the first
      one will receive standard radiosurgery; the second group will be submitted to a false
      radiosurgery (""sham operation""). Patients who had been previously submitted to sham surgery
      will be able to undergo real operations after one year of follow-up, when blinding is broken.
      For a minimum period of one year, patients will be periodically followed-up in terms of

      placebo in subjects with a diagnosis of noncombat-related Posttraumatic Stress Disorder
      (PTSD), whose symptoms are considered moderate or severe.

      Following an initial screening visit, subjects fulfilling the study inclusion and exclusion
      criteria will enter a pre-treatment screening phase to permit evaluation of the laboratory
      and ECG assessments and to confirm eligibility for inclusion into the study. This screening
      phase will be a minimum of 7 days, but no longer than 21 days. At the completion of the
      screening period, eligible subjects will be randomized at the baseline visit to receive
      either orvepitant 60mg/day or placebo (1:1 ratio). Those subjects randomized to receive
      placebo will receive study medication identical in appearance to that received by subjects
      assigned to receive orvepitant.

      Efficacy will be assessed using the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) as the primary
      efficacy measure. Key secondary efficacy endpoints will be based on the Davidson Trauma Scale
      (DTS), the Short PTSD Rating Interview (SPRINT), the Clinical Global Impression- Global

      Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), the Cognitive and Physical Functioning Questionnaire (CPFQ)
      and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).

      Safety will be assessed by monitoring for adverse events (side effects) and through periodic
      laboratory evaluations (blood tests), vital signs assessments (e.g., blood pressure, heart
      rate, temperature) and heart function measurements (electrocardiograms, or ECGs).

NCT01002300,Oxytocin and Social Cognition in Frontotemporal Dementia,"
      Investigations into the components of cognition damaged in frontotemporal dementia (FTD)
      demonstrate that patients with FTD show deficits in facial and verbal expression recognition,
      lack insight into what others think or might do (theory of mind skills), and in decision
      making tasks requiring processing of positive versus negative feedback. These cognitive
      functions are thought to be critical for appropriate social behavioural regulation (Blair,
      2003). Recent studies in animal models and humans suggest that the neuropeptide oxytocin is
      an important mediator of social behavior and that oxytocin may facilitate emotion
      recognition, theory of mind processing, and prosocial behaviors (Donaldson and Young, 2008).
      Together, these findings suggest that upregulation of oxytocin dependent mechanisms of social
      and emotional cognition may be a valuable treatment approach in patients with FTD. The aim of
      this study is to determine how administration of intranasal oxytocin to patients with
      frontotemporal dementia affects behavior and processing of specific types of social and
      emotional information.The investigators' hypothesis is that oxytocin administration will
      improve emotional and social cognitive deficits in patients with FTD, resulting in improved

      This R01 grant describes a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of nicotine
      nasal spray (NNS) as an aid for smoking cessation in 60 individuals with schizophrenia. The
      objectives of this study are to determine the efficacy of NNS with behavioral intervention
      for smoking cessation in smokers with schizophrenia. It is hypothesized that the quit rate of
      subjects who receive NNS and behavioral intervention will be significantly greater than the
      quit rate of the control group who will receive the placebo spray plus same behavioral
      intervention. Quit rate is defined as the proportion of individuals who self report no

NCT01010685,Safety Study of Keyhole Gallbladder Surgery With Removal of Gallbladder Via the Stomach Rather Than Through the Skin,"
      The benefits of laparoscopic (""minimally invasive"" or ""keyhole"") surgery for gallbladder
      removal (cholecystectomy) over open surgical procedures in terms of significant reductions in
      pain, scarring and recovery time are well accepted. In a conventional laparoscopic
      cholecystectomy however, the excised gallbladder still has to be extracted through the
      abdominal wall skin via a laparoscopic port site using an incision of 10mm or greater.
      Despite being much smaller than that required for open surgery, this incision is painful,
      leaves a scar and can result in a port site hernia to follow requiring further surgery to
      repair it. Recent attempts to further reduce the invasiveness of the surgical procedure have
      suggested performing the operation via an endoscope passed through the mouth and through an
      incision in the stomach wall - so called Natural Orifice Translumenal Endoscopic Surgery
      (NOTES). Unlike a skin incision, an incision in the wall of the stomach (gastrotomy) should
      give no pain, visible scar or herniation risk yet still allow access to the peritoneal cavity
      for surgical procedures such as cholecystectomy. Against this, it has the potential risks of
      contamination and leakage of gastric contents into the peritoneal cavity. Whilst the
      limitations of present technology make it very difficult to perform an entire cholecystectomy
      through the stomach wall in patients, endoscopic methods for closing a gastrotomy are
      available that are approved for use in patients (CE marked) and it is hypothesised that
      removing the excised gallbladder through the stomach in this way would avoid the problems of
      extracting it through the abdominal wall described above. Data are required to determine
      whether the extraction of the gallbladder via a gastrotomy rather than through the skin is
      safe, producing smaller scars and a better cosmetic result. A secondary endpoint would be to
      assess possible reductions in pain and recovery from this less invasive approach.

NCT01011712,The Natural History of Severe Viral Infections and Characterization of Immune Defects in Patients Without Known Immunocompromise,"
      Background:

        -  Infections caused by viruses are common causes of illnesses: the common cold, many ear
           infections, sore throats, chicken pox, and the flu are caused by different viruses.
           Usually, these illnesses last only few days or, at most, a few weeks. Some virus
           infections like influenza are cleared from the body, and others such as the chicken pox
           virus remain in the body in an inactive state. However, some people may become quite ill
           when they are infected with a particular virus, possibly because part of their immune
           system does not respond properly to fight the virus.

        -  Researchers have discovered some reasons why a person may not be able to clear an
           infection caused by a virus. Some persons have changes in the genes that involve the
           immune system that result in the inability to properly control infection with a
           particular virus. Identifying changes in genes that involve the immune system should
           help scientists better understand how the immune system works to protect people from
           infection and may help develop new therapies.

      Objectives:

        -  To study possible immune defects that may be linked to a particular severe viral
           infection.

        -  To determine if identified immune defects are genetic in origin.

      Eligibility:

        -  Individuals of any age who have or have had a diagnosis of a virus infection that
           physicians consider to be unusually severe, prolonged, or difficult to treat.

        -  Relatives of the participants with a severe viral infection may also participate in the
           study. We will use their blood and/or skin specimens to try to determine if identified
           immune defects are hereditary.

      Design:

        -  Prior to the study, the participant's doctor will give researchers the details of the
           infection, along with medical records for review. Eligible participants will be invited
           to the NIH Clinical Center for a full evaluation as an outpatient or inpatient.

        -  At the Clinical Center, participants will be treated with the best available therapy for
           the particular viral infection, and researchers will monitor how the infection responds
           to the treatment.

        -  Researchers will take intermittent blood samples and conduct other tests (such as skin
           biopsies) to evaluate the immune system. - During and after the illness, researchers
           will conduct follow-up visits to determine the course of infection and response to
           therapy.

      The Creighton Model (CrM) FertilityCare System is a natural family planning method that
      teaches couples to recognize and chart the signs of fertility and infertility in the woman's
      cycle and to use that knowledge to either achieve or avoid a pregnancy. The method is
      natural, safe and effective, and it helps the couple understand their fertility. Trained
      practitioners at FertilityCare Centers teach the Creighton Model across the country,
      internationally and long distance.

      Several FertilityCare Centers and the University of Utah are conducting a study to evaluate
      the effectiveness of the Creighton Model (CrM) for new and return users wanting to avoid
      pregnancy. While past studies have shown that the Creighton Model is a highly effective
      method, this study will use new ways to measure how well it works. This is important because
      the knowledge gained will improve comparisons between the Creighton Model and other family
      planning methods. The study will also explore intentions and behaviors of couples to avoid or
      achieve a pregnancy.

      The investigators hypothesize that for the CrM the pregnancy rate during perfect use to avoid
      pregnancy will be about 1% and the behaviorally determined avoiding-related pregnancy rate
      for the CrM will be about 6%. The investigators will also evaluate the pregnancy rate during

      The primary objective of this study is to determine any causative or associated factors for
      the development of Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis (NSF), Nephrogenic Fibrosing Dermopathy
      (NFD), or related diagnosis. Our primary focus will be on the previous administration of
      gadolinium to these patients, but we will also look at other postulated causes and risk
      factors.

      The secondary objective of this study is to assess tissue gadolinium (Gd) levels in five
      groups of subjects:

        -  Those affected by NSF.

        -  Those with normal kidney function who have undergone a medical imaging procedure using
           Gd-based contrast agent (GBCA) in the 2 years prior to a skin biopsy.

        -  Those with normal kidney function who have never been exposed to GBCA and have had a
           skin biopsy.

        -  Those on dialysis or with eGFR ≤ 30 ml/min/1.73 m2 who have had a medical imaging
           procedure using GBCA in the 2 years prior to skin biopsy.

        -  Those on dialysis or with eGFR ≤ 30 ml/min/1.73 m2 who have never been exposed to GBCA
           and have had skin biopsy.

      We hypothesize that there is a correlation between the administration of Gd-containing agents
      usually associated with MRI procedures and the development of NSF in those with renal failure
      and some other predisposing condition. We also hypothesize that tissue Gd levels in those
      with NSF will be higher than in those who have been exposed to GBCA but do not have NSF. Of
      the two groups without NSF but with exposure to GBCA, we hypothesize that those with kidney
      dysfunction will have higher tissue Gd levels than those with normal kidney function. We
      hypothesize that in the two groups of subjects without exposure to GBCA, there will be no
      detectable levels of Gd, regardless of kidney function status.

      Maximizing surgical removal of brain tumors while minimizing neurologic deficits is
      challenging. Functional brain tissue may reside close to or even within the abnormality, and
      inadvertent removal or disturbance of such areas can result in neurologic deficits. At
      present, the gold standard for identifying critical motor areas in tumor surgery is
      intraoperative invasive direct current stimulation (DCS) through a handpiece. More recently,
      new non-invasive preoperative method for brain mapping, functional magnetic resonance imaging
      (fMRI), may be used to identify the eloquent motor areas. fMRI signals used in localization
      of the motor areas are generated when the brain is activated during the performance of
      specific motor tasks. However, as fMRI signals are also generated by sensory input, the
      resulting fMRI map may include sensory as well as motor areas.

      Nexstim has developed a Navigated Brain Stimulation (NBS) system that uses TMS with a
      software based Navigational System that together may have more specific spatial accuracy.

      This study aims to determine whether navigated TMS is able to identify the eloquent motor
      cortical areas in patients with brain tumors and to determine the clinical accuracy of the
      procedure by comparing it to results obtained by intraoperative DCS and fMRI.

NCT01019382,A Study of the Effect of Gemcitabine With Fish Oil in Patients With Advanced Pancreatic Cancer,"
      Over 7000 patients are diagnosed with pancreas cancer every year in the UK. Only 10% have it
      caught early enough to have surgery to cure it. The rest at best can undergo chemotherapy to
      extend survival, but current treatments offer at best an improvement of only a few months
      compared to no treatment at all. In addition only about a quarter of patients will respond to
      the treatment. In addition these patients often experience profound weight loss, loss of
      appetite and energy primarily because of the cancer process itself. Our hypothesis is that
      the addition of fish oil infusion to gemcitabine chemotherapy will result in an improved rate
      of tumour response on CT imaging.

      Fish oils, or specifically the omega-3 fatty acid component, appear to have a range of
      powerful anti-cancer actions. This is supported by evidence from a wide range of sources,
      from laboratory experiments to basic human studies. Although this evidence specifically
      includes many pancreatic cancer studies in the laboratory it has not yet been confirmed in
      human trials.

      Contrary to conventional chemotherapy, fish oil is a naturally occuring non-toxic compound
      and so is not associated with the side-effects of chemotherapy. In fact a number of clinical
      studies have demonstrated significant improvements in quality of life for pancreas cancer
      patients treated with fish oil, particularly with reference to improvements in appetite and
      energy levels. This is of course in addition to the anti-cancer actions.

NCT01019486,Regadenoson Blood Flow in Type 1 Diabetes (RABIT1D),"
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the major cause of mortality and morbidity in both type
      1 (T1D) and type 2 (T2D) diabetes patients; modifications of traditional CVD risk factors
      have had a limited impact. This project called Regadenoson Blood flow in Type 1 Diabetes
      (RABIT1D) and is proposed as a sub-study of the Coronary Artery Calcification in Type 1
      Diabetes (CACTI) study, which has established a unique cohort of 656 T1D patients (age 20-55,
      minimal diabetes duration of 10 yrs) and 764 non-diabetic controls. This cohort is being
      followed for progression of coronary artery calcification (CAC) measured using the electron
      beam tomography (EBT) for development of clinical CVD. Participants have been well
      characterized during the baseline examination (4/00-3/02) and two follow-up re-examinations 3
      and 6 years later. The study has provided important insights into the risk factors and
      possible prevention of premature CVD in T1D. We are proposing assess a subset of this
      population to determine vasodilatory reserve as it relates to early coronary atherosclerosis
      in T1D.

      Hypothesis: that myocardial blood imaging (MBF) reserve can be measured in Type 1 diabetes
      mellitus (DM) using regadenoson stress cardiac magnetic resonance and that significantly
      reduced MBF is a marker of extensive atherosclerotic disease correlated to coronary arterial
      calcification, plaque formation and impaired vasodilatory reserve.

NCT01012180,Parents With Bipolar Disorder: Relationship of Adaptation to Own Illness With Risk Perception and Coping With Perceived Risk to a Child,"
      Background:

        -  Bipolar disorder is a common mood disorder that affects 1% to 2% of the population.
           Individuals with bipolar disorder tend to have periods of mania that are characterized
           by extra energy, very poor judgment or unrealistic beliefs about their thoughts and
           abilities, and an inability to complete thoughts and tasks; as well as major depressive
           episodes. The range and frequency of symptoms in affected individuals can vary greatly.
           Most individuals have cyclical symptoms and spend more time in a normal mood state than
           in an overtly symptomatic state.

        -  Relatives of individuals with bipolar disorder have an increased risk for bipolar
           disorder and other mood disorders. Currently, risk assessment for recurrence of a mood
           disorder is based on family and medical histories; genetic testing has not proved
           particularly useful to date for assessing risks of a mood disorder.

        -  Despite its prevalence, there is limited research on coping with bipolar illness. No
           published studies have examined adaptation to living with bipolar disorder or risk for
           bipolar disorder. More specifically, though a positive family history is the most
           important known risk factor for bipolar disorder, there are no published studies about
           response to the threat of future illness onset in children, risk modification efforts
           undertaken by affected parents, or coping with the risk for illness in children.

      Objectives:

        -  To examine parents appraisals of the impact and cause of bipolar disorder, and the
           association with their perceived risk for bipolar illness in their child and how they
           cope with their perception of risk to their child.

        -  To assess whether parents adaptation to their own illness is associated with coping with
           perceived risk to their child.

        -  To describe parents coping strategies related to perceived risk in their children.

      Eligibility:

      - Men and women at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and
      who have at least one biological child (30 years of age or younger). Participants must be a
      primary caregiver for their children.

      Design:

        -  Participants in this study will take an online survey and answer questions about disease
           perceptions, coping strategies, and adapting to a diagnosis of bipolar disorder,
           addressing issues such as the following:

        -  Assessing the threat of bipolar disorder and coping with one s own illness.

        -  Optimism/pessimism of the individual coping with the illness.

        -  Perception of risk to a child, and coping with the perceived risk.

        -  Data from this study will not be shared with the participants/respondents.

      Primary Objectives:

      The primary objective of the trial is to compare the antiviral efficacy of a 10 day course of
      standard (75 mg bid) and high-dose (225 mg bid) oseltamivir (or equivalent doses in
      mild-moderate renal failure) in the treatment of severe influenza infections.

      The hypothesis is that high dose oseltamivir will increase the proportion of patients with
      negative reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR detection of influenza viral RNA (and viral culture,
      at selected sites) at Day 5 post-treatment.

      An important secondary objective of the trial, which reflects the main clinical objective, is

      immobilization technique is controversial. Few, retrospective studies have been conducted to
      evaluate bone healing after casting versus splinting. However, the impact of the
      immobilization technique on daily function and comfort has not been evaluated.

      Objective: To compare the impact on daily function, comfort and satisfaction of casting
      versus splinting in children with distal radial buckle fractures.

      Primary Hypothesis: Children with short arm casts to immobilize a distal radial buckle
      fracture will have a greater reduction in daily activities compared to those immobilized with
      a volar splint.

      Secondary Hypothesis: Children who are immobilized in a short arm cast will have less pain,
      less patient/parental satisfaction, more adverse effects, fewer follow-up visits, longer
      emergency department (ED) treatment time. Furthermore, we hypothesize that all fractures will

NCT01014039,"Telemark Polyp Study, a Trial on Colonoscopy Screening","
      Colonoscopy screening to reduce mortality and incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) has been
      implemented in many western countries. The estimated effect is based on case-control and
      observational studies. There are no randomized trials quantifying the effect of colonoscopy
      screening on CRC incidence and mortality.

      The present study investigates the effect of a population-based once-only colonoscopy
      screening with polypectomy on the incidence of CRC in an average risk population.

      In 1983, 900 individuals 55 to 64 years of age were randomly drawn from the population
      registry of Telemark county, Norway. 400 of these were invited to a flexible sigmoidoscopy
      screening examination, and 400 individuals were not offered any screening. In 1996, the
      remainder, both cohorts from 1983 were invited to a colonoscopy screening examination. A new
      age and sex matched control group, not being offered screening, was randomly drawn from the
      same registry. Both groups are to be followed with regard to CRC incidence, CRC mortality and
      all-cause mortality through national Norwegian registries.

NCT01014169,Study of the Impact of Parental Note Taking on the Effectiveness of Anticipatory Guidance,"
      The delivery of anticipatory guidance is an essential component of pediatric practice. Given
      the large amount of information to be shared during each encounter and the limited time
      available, there is a need for an effective and efficient means of communication between
      health care providers and families. The investigators hypothesize that more active parental
      participation in the form of note taking during the delivery of anticipatory guidance will
      lead to increased knowledge, higher levels of satisfaction with the encounter, and increased
      adoption of recommended parenting practices.

      In this study, the investigators propose a randomized controlled trial of the impact of note
      taking during the delivery of newborn anticipatory guidance on maternal practices related to
      newborn care. The investigators plan to compare a control group of mothers receiving standard
      of care anticipatory guidance with an intervention group of mothers who are encouraged to
      take written notes while receiving the anticipatory guidance. The primary outcome of interest
      is maternal practice related to infant sleep position, and the secondary outcomes of interest
      are maternal practice related to breastfeeding initiation and car seat use. The investigators
      also plan to evaluate the impact of note taking on mothers' knowledge of recommended
      practices related to newborn care and on mothers' satisfaction with the guidance received.

NCT01014455,Monitoring of Exhaled Carbon Monoxide to Promote Pre-operative Smoking Cessation,"
      Smoking causes 90% of all lung cancer deaths among men and 80% of lung cancer deaths in
      women. Surgery is a great opportunity to help patients quit smoking. Smokers are at increased
      risk for heart, lung, and wound complications around the time of surgery. Even a brief
      abstinence from smoking can produce benefits. Surgery can also motivate smokers to quit
      spontaneously. If the investigators can take advantage of this great opportunity, they may be
      able to help many smokers quit using simple means. However, currently most smokers continue
      to smoke cigarette on the morning before surgery, as shown by the measurement of exhaled
      carbon monoxide (CO) on the morning of surgery. CO is one of the many poisons in cigarette
      smoke. It only stays in the body for a few hours. By asking smokers to blow into a small
      machine, the investigators can test the CO level in the smokers' body and thus know if they
      have just smoked within the past few hours. The goal of this study is to determine the role
      of carbon monoxide monitoring as a means to decrease cigarette smoking before surgery. The
      investigators will identify a group of smokers who are scheduled for surgery and invite them
      to participate. One or two days before surgery, half of the patients will receive a brief
      advice about quit smoking. The other half of patients will be told that their CO will be
      checked before surgery, in addition to the brief advice. On the morning of surgery, the
      investigators will then check their CO level to determine if they have followed the advice.
      In order to have a better understanding about the factors influencing patients' intent to
      quit smoking, the investigators will ask all study participants to fill out a questionnaire.
      The questionnaire is constructed according to behavioral theories which provide good
      framework for studying people's intent and behavior. If the investigators are successful,
      they will determine how much of an impact the message of CO testing has on smoking before
      surgery. The investigators will also gain insights into facilitators and barriers to smoking
      cessation around the time of surgery. The brief intervention evaluated in this study has
      potential to be disseminated and to promote the long term health of surgical patients.

      Primary endpoint is to a assess the change in blood loss (originating from stapling the
      stomach) with the use of Seamguard reinforcement Secondary endpoint is to evaluate the
      difference in leak rate

      Methods :

      Prospective. Randomized study. Published data does not allow for clear determination of the
      number of patients required for the study. Based on our own experience. The investigators
      estimate that the average postoperative blood loss is 200ml with a standard deviation of
      100ml over 3 days. Based on this assumption. A total number of patients (control + Seamguard
      groups) of 60 is required if the expected reduction of the mean drainage volume is 100ml and
      82 patients for an expected drainage volume reduction of 85ml.

      All patients candidates to a laparoscopic gastric bypass will be enrolled in the study Under
      the conditions this is a primary bariatric procedure (no revision allowed)., no history of
      hiatal surgery such as anti-reflux nor significant upper abdominal surgery. The only
      associated surgical procedure allowed is the cholecystectomy.

      Patients' inclusion :

      Will be done immediately before surgical procedure following acceptance of a written consent.

      Bleeding from liver or slpeen injury will lead to patient's exclusion.

      Methods :

      Surgical procedures are identical for the 2 surgeons of the study (GB and PT) with 30-50ml
      gastric pouch. Linear. side to side. Antegastric and antecolic gastrojejunal anstomosis . Use
      of Echelon 60 linear stapler with GOLD cartridges on stomach. Blue to perform the

      Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the United States and is
      associated with a poor prognosis. The average life expectancy after diagnosis is
      approximately 5 to 8 months. At present, successful surgical resection is the only curative
      therapy that can improve long-term survival. However, it can be achieved only when a tumor is
      detected at an early stage. Unfortunately, due to non-specific symptoms associated with
      pancreatic cancer, it is commonly detected in the later stages of the disease.

      The investigators hypothesized that pancreatic cancer could be detected by measuring the
      changes in the early increase in blood supply (EIBS) found in the surrounding
      normal-appearing duodenal tissue. The investigators tested a device called Four-dimensional

NCT01017861,The Effect of Pregnancy on Temporal Summation and Venipuncture Pain Perception,"
      Recent studies have shown that women are more likely to experience pain in many medical
      situations. During pregnancy, women may experience an increase in pain threshold. This is
      thought to be related to hormonal changes and an increase in the level of certain natural
      pain-relieving substances in their bodies.

      It is important to develop simple tests to identify woman at higher risk for pain so the
      investigators can help them.

      Temporal summation is what happens when a person becomes more sensitive to a certain feeling
      on their skin when it is applied several times over the course of several seconds. The
      investigators hypothesize that pregnant women show decreased temporal summation and pain

NCT01018082,"Longitudinal Study of Neurologic, Cognitive, and Radiologic Outcomes of PHACE Syndrome","
      The overall goal of this 2-year pilot project is to utilize interdisciplinary strategies to
      determine the prevalence and type of neurodevelopmental impairment in PHACE syndrome, a rare
      vascular syndrome, and to rapidly translate discovery into clinical care guidelines that will
      identify at risk infants so early intervention can be initiated. Infantile hemangioma is the
      most common benign tumor of infancy, with an incidence estimated between 4-5%. A subgroup of
      patients with infantile hemangiomas exhibits additional associated structural anomalies of
      the brain, cerebral vasculature, eyes, aorta, heart, and chest wall in the rare
      neurocutaneous disorder called PHACE syndrome (OMIM 606519). PHACE refers to Posterior fossa
      anomalies, Hemangioma, Arterial lesions, Cardiac abnormalities/aortic coarctation, and
      abnormalities of the Eye. Affected children have multi-organ involvement, and an increasing
      number of cerebral, cerebellar, and cerebrovascular anomalies are being described; however,
      the significance of these neuroradiologic findings is not known. As the investigators'
      neonates with hemangiomas have grown into young children, neurodevelopmental impairment has
      become more evident, even among patients without MRI evidence of stroke or structural brain
      anomalies. Some infants develop progressive cerebral arterial disease leading to a
      moyamoya-like vasculopathy and ischemic stroke. An interdisciplinary research project
      studying brain and cerebral vascular imaging in concert with neurological, psychological,
      behavioral, neurodevelopmental, and quality of life outcome measures has never been
      conducted. Diagnostic and management guidelines are also lacking. The investigators'
      long-term goal is to develop medical and/or surgical therapeutic interventions that improve
      the overall health of children with PHACE syndrome. This novel project constitutes the first
      study of the most devastating feature of PHACE syndrome: the neurodevelopmental sequelae.

NCT01019083,Studies of Immune Responses to Orally Administered Vaccines in Developing Country,"
      The efficacy and immunogenicity of enteric vaccines have generally been found to be lower in
      children in the developed than in the developing countries. This has been observed with
      vaccines against cholera rotavirus, ETEC and typhoid vaccines. There are a number of factors
      that may contribute to such differences in vaccine ""take rates"" in children, e.g. breast
      feeding and nutritional status of the children might influence their immunogenicity and
      efficacy. Thus, breast feeding of newborn and young infants may adversely influence the
      immune response to vaccination, which might have more pronounced effect in developing than in
      developed countries. Breastfeeding has also been shown to interfere with the serum immune
      responses to rotavirus vaccine although this effect could be overcome by administering three
      rather than one dose of the oral rotavirus vaccine. Our recent study of Dukoral in
      Bangladeshi children aged 18 months or younger has shown that the response rates and the
      magnitude of responses improved when breast milk was temporarily withheld . Thus,
      administration of vaccines may have to be adjusted when given to breast fed children. Another
      factor that may affect the immunogenicity is the effect of zinc. Previous studies have shown
      that zinc enhances the immune response to cholera vaccine in participants > 2 years of age ,
      a recent study also observed a similar effect in infants.

      In this research project, we plan to study a number of different factors that might influence
      the immunogenicity of the two licensed oral model vaccines, specifically the inactivated
      killed oral cholera vaccine, Dukoral, and the live oral typhoid vaccine, Ty21a. We will also
      identify strategies that might improve the immunogenicity of the vaccines. The main objective
      of our study is to identify immunization regimens that may improve the immunogenicity of the
      vaccines in young children, which could be subsequently in field trials in Bangladesh and
      other developing countries. Specifically, we will determine if: (i) interventions identified
      to enhance immune responses to Dukoral, including zinc supplementation, could also enhance
      the immune responses to Ty21a; (ii) these two vaccines are able to induce both acute and
      memory B and T cell responses, (iii) treatment with antiparasitic drugs prior to immunization
      could modulate the immune responses to cholera and typhoid vaccines; and (iv) examine if
      arsenic exerts a suppressive effect on the immunogenicity of these vaccines.

      Objective. To study the role of nasogastric drainage to prevent postoperative complications
      in children with <b>distal</b> elective bowel anastomosis. Summary Background Data.
      Nasogastric drainage has been used as a routine measure after gastrointestinal surgery in
      children and adults, to hasten bowel function, prevent post operative complications and
      shorten hospital stay. However, there is no former study that states in a scientific manner
      its benefit in children. Methods. The investigators performed a clinical controlled,
      randomized trial, comprising 60 children that underwent distal elective bowel anastomoses
      comparing post operative complications between a group with nasogastric tube in place (n=29)
      and one without it (n=31). <b>As an equivalence study the investigators expected that the two
      techniques were equivalent.</b> Statistics: Descriptive statistics for global description.
      Student's t test for quantitative variables and chi square test for qualitative variables.
      Considering statistically significant a p-value less than 0.05. <b>Being an equivalence
      study, the default delta generated by the Stata command ""equim"" was used to demonstrate the
      equivalence between both groups.</b> Results: Demographic data and diagnosis were comparable
      in both groups (p=NS). No anastomotic leakage or entero-cutaneous fistulae was found in any
      patient. The investigators demonstrated equivalency since each confidence interval is
      entirely contained within delta, except for one variable (beginning deambulation), in which
      equivalency is suggested. There were no significant differences between groups in abdominal
      distention, infection, or hospital stay variables. Only one patient in the experimental group
      required placement of the nasogastric tube due to persistent abdominal distension (3.2%).
      Conclusions. The routine use of nasogastric drainage can be eliminated after distal elective
      intestinal surgery in children. It's use should be individualized.

NCT01010958,Adjuvant Valproate for High Grade Sarcomas,"
      For patients initially presenting with localized sarcoma the standard of care is surgery
      followed by with radiation therapy (if feasible). Subsequent or adjuvant cytotoxic based
      chemotherapy even for aggressive sarcoma histopathologies (as commonly done for colorectal
      cancer or breast cancer) is controversial since over 20 individual adjuvant randomized
      clinical trials have not been able to consistently demonstrate a statistically significant
      improvement in overall survival. Maturation or differentiation therapy provides an
      opportunity to fundamentally change the biology of the underlying cancer (and thus its
      overall prognosis) by promoting cellular maturation within that cancer. A change from a
      poorly 'differentiated/high grade' tumor to a well 'differentiated/low grade' tumor is
      attainable and can change an individual's median time of survival from months to decades. The
      investigators have significant preclinical data that differentiation therapy using a group of
      drugs referred to as histone deacetylase inhibitors (such as Valproate, also a commonly used
      and safe anti seizure medication) is feasible for sarcomas. This approach has not been
      clinically addressed in solid tumors. Since adjuvant therapy is controversial for sarcomas,
      and building on the investigators' preclinical data, adjuvant based differentiation therapy
      using valproate would be predicted to be both safe and potentially extremely beneficial in
      terms of a) increasing the time to disease recurrence, b) improving the histology upon
      recurrence; and c) improving overall survival in patients with sarcomas.

      Patients with high grade sarcomas will receive Valproate in the adjuvant setting daily and
      clinically/radiologically followed until recurrence. Relapse free survival, time to local
      failure, time to distant failure, overall survival, and comparative histopathology of primary
      and recurrence will be assessed.

NCT01012544,Platelet Reactivity in Stent Thrombosis Patients,"
      Recent studies have demonstrated a marked interindividual variability of clopidogrel's
      capacity to inhibit platelet aggregation with a substantial proportion (11-34%) of the
      patients considered non-responders to clopidogrel treatment. Variable intestinal absorption
      is suggested to contribute to the inconsistencies in response to clopidogrel. However, little
      is known about intestinal absorption in subjects who had suffered from a stent thrombosis.
      The MAPCAT-study has been designed to investigate whether plasma pharmacokinetics
      (represented by Cmax, Tmax and the AUC) after a 600 mg loading dose are significantly
      different between subjects who have suffered a stent thrombosis and subjects who have not
      suffered a stent thrombosis.

NCT01010204,Varenicline Treatment for Smoking Cessation in Patients With Bipolar Disorder,"
      The investigators' hypothesis is that add-on varenicline will be effective (versus placebo)
      in initiating abstinence from smoking in subjects with stable, euthymic bipolar disorder who
      are motivated to quit smoking within four weeks. This primary outcome will be assessed from
      randomization to 12 weeks or end of the treatment phase of the study. Secondarily, the
      investigators also hypothesize that varenicline will prevent relapse in the subsequent
      12-weeks follow-up non-treatment phase. Furthermore, the investigators plan to test the
      effectiveness of varenicline in reducing nicotine withdrawal symptoms or urges to smoke, as
      well as its safety for use in stable bipolar patients when used as an add-on treatment for
      smoking cessation.

      The investigators plan to test these hypotheses by conducting a randomized,
      placebo-controlled add-on treatment trial of Chantix with 60 recruited subjects diagnosed
      with DSM-IV bipolar disorder for a period of three months. The investigators will follow-up
      with them three months later to evaluate extended abstinence.

      that vitamin D3 deficiency is common worldwide. It is especially common in northern countries
      with long winters due to inadequate sun exposure during winter. In the US, an estimated 36%
      to 57% of healthy middle-aged to elderly adults have vitamin D3 deficiency. Current research

NCT01011101,Internal Monitoring of Eye Movement in Schizophrenia,"
      Background:

        -  Researchers are studying how humans are able to move our eyes to a remembered region
           even when the target has disappeared. The ability to do this suggests that the brain can
           keep track of where the eyes have looked, without an external target for continued
           reference. This is called corollary discharge.

        -  Other research has indicated that patients with schizophrenia might have difficulty
           monitoring their eye movements. The corollary discharge process may be defective in
           patients with schizophrenia, and perhaps delayed in time. Researchers have developed a
           test to examine this possibility in the hope of learning more about schizophrenia and
           eye movement.

      Objectives:

      - To assess whether there is a defect in internal monitoring of eye movements in patients
      with schizophrenia.

      Eligibility:

        -  Individuals over 18 years of age who are able to give informed consent and are able to
           concentrate on a 20-minute task that involves following projected targets and moving
           their eyes to remembered locations.

        -  Individuals with schizophrenia will be recruited from an ongoing NIH protocol studying
           schizophrenia.

        -  In addition healthy will be recruited for this protocol.

      Design:

        -  Researchers will check participants' vision in each eye, and ask them to sit at a
           machine that measures eye movement in order to complete research tasks. Researchers will
           monitor participants ability to complete these tasks.

        -  The first task involves simply following a target that jumps to different parts of the
           screen.

        -  The second is a 2-step task, in which a participant is asked to look at two separate
           light targets and then look at the remembered target positions when the lights are off.

        -  This protocol does not provide treatment. Participants will remain under the care of
           their own physicians during participation in this protocol.

      tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation that can lead to sudden cardiac death. Subjects will
      be asked to participate in this research study if they have recurrent ventricular tachycardia
      (at least one ICD shock for ventricular tachycardia) and have undergone at least one catheter
      ablation procedure or have ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation that is not ablatable. The
      goal of this study is to determine whether cardiac sympathetic denervation can prevent these
      abnormal heart rhythms from occurring and therefore, prevent, ICD shocks which are not only
      painful, but have been shown to reduce quality of life and/or lead to depression,
      particularly in the period immediately after the shock.

NCT01013051,Effect of Gastric Bypass on the Absorption of Metformin,"
      Background: Gastric bypass is the most commonly performed type of bariatric (obesity)
      surgery, has dramatically increased in popularity and is now considered to be preferred
      treatments in severely obese patients that fail non-surgical therapy - particularly in
      patients with type 2 diabetes. Drug malabsorption is a potential concern post-gastric bypass
      because intestinal length is reduced.

      Purpose: The purpose of this controlled, pharmacokinetic study is to determine whether the
      absorption of a single dose of metformin, the first line drug treatment in patients with type
      2 diabetes, is significantly reduced after gastric bypass.

      Methods: A single dose of standard release metformin 1000 mg will be administered to patients
      who have undergone gastric bypass and to patients who have not received surgery but are on
      the wait list (wait-listed controls). Blood sampling and urine sampling will occur in
      standardized fashion over the ensuing 24 hours to measure and compare the absorption of
      metformin between study arms. 34 patients total will be recruited.

      Significance: Following completion of this study, we will better understand how gastric
      bypass affects metformin absorption. Ultimately, this information will help to ensure that
      this patient population is receiving optimal doses of this important drug treatment.

NCT01011595,"Minimally Invasive, Diagnosis and Staging of Lung Cancer","
      The gold standard techniques to assess the extent of disease and decide on therapy for
      patients with lung cancer consists of cervical mediastinoscopy, which is a surgical procedure
      which entails an incision in the neck and the removal of lymph nodes from around the airway.
      Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) are new, non-surgical
      techniques that have been available for the past several years and are proving invaluable in
      lung cancer evaluation. These techniques are minimally invasive and can be performed without
      surgery.

      To date, there have been no head-to-head studies on the same group of patients using both the
      old and new techniques. The study will consist of a study which compares traditional staging
      techniques in lung cancer patients to new, less invasive techniques.

      The significance of the proposed project is tremendous. If the new strategies prove to be
      equivalent (or superior) to traditional techniques, these techniques will be considered the
      new gold-standard tests. This will change the way lung cancer is evaluated. An equivalent or

      Determine the likelihood that lenalidomide will adequately control the disease for at least
      one year.

      Lenalidomide is a drug that alters the immune system and it may also interfere with the
      development of tiny blood vessels that help support tumor growth. Therefore, in theory, it
      may reduce or prevent the growth of cancer cells. Lenalidomide is approved by the Food and
      Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of specific types of myelodysplastic syndrome
      (MDS) and in combination with dexamethasone for patients with multiple myeloma (MM) who have
      received at least 1 prior therapy. MDS and MM are cancers of the blood. It is currently being
      tested in a variety of cancer conditions.

NCT01016587,Symptom Clusters and Immune Markers in Patients With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) - a Longitudinal Study,"
      COPD patients often have a wide range of physical (e.g., dyspnea, fatigue, pain) and
      psychological (e.g., depression, anxiety) symptoms and various other debilitating conditions
      that cause considerable suffering for the individual. Unfortunately, many of the symptoms and
      health problems in patients with COPD are unrecognized and untreated. Due to the irreversible
      nature of COPD, the aim is not to cure the disease, but to reduce symptoms and improve
      quality of life.

      Therefore, the purpose of this project is to investigate the existence and nature of symptom
      clusters over time in patients with COPD and their effects on patient outcomes. Since this
      study aims to identify possible new subgroups of patients with COPD defined by the clustering
      of certain symptoms, the study also aims to investigate the relationship between the clinical
      presentation and certain immunologic and genetic factors.

NCT01016613,Clinical Phenotyping Resource and Biobank Core of the Michigan O'Brien Renal Center,"
      Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects approximately 26 million Americans and
      disproportionately manifests in specific race and ethnic groups. Patients burdened with CKD
      have significant morbidity and reduced life expectancy. In addition to excessive suffering
      and lost productivity, the cost of managing this epidemic has reached $40 billion annually.
      The recognition that CKD is a major public health problem is reflected in the fourteen
      objectives outlined in Healthy People 2020 to begin to address the disease burden.
      Advancement in approaches to halt CKD progression has been slow despite growing global
      awareness of disease burden.

      This O'Brien Kidney Research Core will create opportunities for novel insights through
      characterization of tissue profiles that will define new disease markers and molecular
      pathways and will be available to all kidney investigators on the www. It will thereby
      fundamentally alter the starting point for research into prevention of progression of these
      kidney diseases. C-PROBE is an essential element of the center grant and presents a
      biomedical resource core consisting of: (1) clinical phenotyping (that is, systematic
      identification of observable physical and biomedical characteristics) of kidney disease
      patients including the accurate measurement of kidney function; and (2) a specimen BioBank
      which will store blood, urine and kidney tissue samples. A key component of C-PROBE is
      therefore that it contains a proven mechanism to collect samples from high risk groups
      including minorities, at the institutions of University of Michigan Health System, St. John
      Hospital, Wayne State University in Michigan, John H. Stroger Hospital in Illinois, Temple
      University Health System in Pennsylvania, and Levine Children's Hospital in North Carolina.
      This mechanism will feed the other Cores and provide biomedical investigators with approved
      projects the access to a dynamic pool of well characterized high risk kidney disease patients
      and their biological specimens to conduct high caliber translational research.

NCT01016938,Dynamic Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) for Lung Tumor Motion and Lung Function (GCC 0943),"
      Radiation treatment for each patient with cancer is designed based on CT scans. We know that
      tumors in the chest and abdomen move when you breathe. Because of this, there can be
      differences between planned treatment and the treatment actually delivered to the body.
      Usually with radiation a safety margin is added to ensure that radiation hits the entire
      tumor. This can damage healthy parts of the body because the exact location of the tumor is
      unknown.

      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a painless and safe diagnostic procedure that uses a
      powerful magnet and radio waves to produce detailed images of the body's organs and
      structures, without the use of X-rays or other radiation.

      The research doctors are studying to see if the position of a tumor can be tracked using MRI
      scans and tracking sensors placed on the skin. MRI scans and the tracking system used to
      calculate the location and position of the tumor are both FDA approved technologies.

      The research doctors will also use the MRI scans to evaluate any changes in your lung
      function during and following your radiation treatments.

      In this study the participant will undergo a series of MRI scans with and without contrast

NCT01017224,DAHANCA 24: Prognostic Value of 18F-FAZA in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC),"
      Solid tumours contain varying degrees of hypoxia. Studies show hypoxia to be associated with
      poor local control and survival, as hypoxia is a cause of resistance to radio- and
      chemotherapy and the development of a more aggressive tumour.

      Previous attempts to measure hypoxia have been biased because the techniques have been
      invasive, not repeatable or difficult to apply on a routine basis. There is great interest in
      trying to measure hypoxia in tumours as this could lead to individualized hypoxia-modifying
      therapy and prediction of treatment response. Additionally the investigators' knowledge of
      change in hypoxia over time is limited, but of great interest as individualised treatment,
      such as intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is emerging.

      18F-FAZA, appears promising. It is a nitroimidazole, which gets trapped in hypoxic cells and
      can be detected by a positron emission therapy (PET) scan. Compared to other nitroimidazoles,
      18F-FAZA has superior biokinetics and thereby is believed to provide a faster and clearer
      image of hypoxia.

      The investigators' hypothesis is that 18F-FAZA can be used as a prognostic marker in HNSCC.

      palsy (CP) living at Hattie Larlham as part of a study comparing growth with an existing
      database of children with CP who live at home. The original residents included in that study
      are now of adult age. Due to the lack of longitudinal bone density measurements in
      facility-based adults with severe CP, the investigators' objective is to obtain 6-year
      follow-up data from the residents enrolled in the original study.

NCT01019356,Role of Insulin Action and Free Fatty Acids in Hyperandrogenism of Women With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,"
      The investigators hypothesis is that free fatty acids (FFA) accumulation in non fatty tissues
      would lead to insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism in PCOS women. Accordingly, Peroxisome
      Proliferator-Activated Receptor gamma (PPARγ) agonist (rosiglitazone) would be a great
      therapeutic option for PCOS as their activation induces transcription factors of gene
      implicated in fatty acids metabolism.

      The aim is to verify if insulin-related hyperandrogenism can be reversed in women having
      polycystic ovary syndrome following an 8-week treatment with rosiglitazone compared to simple
      insulin reduction with acarbose.

      For the purpose of this study, 14 lean women (BMI ≤ 25 kg/m2) and 36 obese women (BMI 30-39
      kg/m2) with PCOS as well as 14 lean and 14 obese control women will be recruited to determine
      their insulin sensibility (insulin levels, M-value, metabolic clearance rate of glucose)and
      FFA metabolism (FFA levels, rythm of apparition and disapearance of FFA) during a 75g oral
      glucose tolerance test and a 2-step insulin-glucose clamp.

      The drugs FEC 100 (5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide) are one of the approved
      options to treat Locally Advanced or Primary Metastatic Breast Cancer. In this study, the
      investigators will add another drug called Valproic Acid (VPA) to see whether this makes the
      treatment better. The addition of Valproic Acid to chemotherapy has been studied in about 65
      subjects with cancer and was found to be safe and tolerable. Valproic Acid is approved by the
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of seizures, mood swings, and migraine
      headaches. It is not currently approved for cancer, which is why the investigators are
      conducting this study.

      The results of a Phase I study of Valproic Acid and FEC100 in subjects with cancer that has
      spread has led the investigators to believe that this combination is better than just the
      standard treatment alone. The investigators are now testing the combination in a study with
      subjects who have either a large tumor, many lymph nodes involved or patients whose tumor has
      spread. In addition to the treatment, a main goal of the study is to find out which subjects
      will benefit from this combination. In the Phase I trial the investigators noticed that while
      this combination appears to make the chemotherapy more effective, it did not appear to cause
      more side effects induced by the chemotherapy.

      in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine hydrochloride and docetaxel, work in different ways to
      stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different
      ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and
      help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may also stop the
      growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. It is not yet known whether
      gemcitabine hydrochloride and docetaxel are more effective when given with or without
      bevacizumab in treating uterine leiomyosarcoma.

NCT01014533,Pharmacotherapy and Mechanisms of Sleep Disturbance in Alcohol Dependence,"
      Insomnia and other sleep abnormalities are common, persistent, and associated with relapse in
      alcohol-dependent patients. The overall, long-term objectives of the proposed research are to
      investigate the neurophysiologic mechanisms of sleep disturbance that are associated with
      relapse in patients with alcohol dependence, and to target those mechanisms with medication
      in order to reduce relapse risk.

      The specific research aims are:

        1. To investigate three potential mechanisms of sleep disturbance in alcoholic patients:
           impaired sleep drive, impaired circadian regulation of alertness, and brain
           hyperactivation;

        2. To investigate short-term effects of medication on sleep and its regulatory mechanisms
           in alcoholics;

        3. To investigate the short-term clinical course of alcoholism as a function of baseline
           sleep parameters.

      In Study Phases I & II (Screening & Baseline: 10+ days), subjects are assessed to diagnose
      alcohol dependence, determine baseline values for drinking and sleeping, and rule out
      confounding sleep-impairing causes.

      Phase III (Medication: 10 days), is a randomized, double-blind parallel design comparison of
      gabapentin vs. placebo on mechanisms of sleep. It is not a therapeutic or clinical trial.
      Phases II & III each have 7 days of monitoring sleep and activity, followed by 3 nights in
      the University of Michigan (UM) sleep laboratory to assess all-night EEG activity and
      Dim-Light Melatonin Onset (DLMO), a measure of circadian rhythm.

      Phase IV is a 2-day medication taper and Phase V (Follow-up) consists of one visit or
      telephone call after 12 weeks to assess course of drinking.

      In summary, sleep disturbance in alcoholic patients increases their risk of relapse. This
      study proposes to investigate the mechanisms causing sleep disturbance in alcoholics and to
      determine if those mechanisms predict return to drinking after 12 weeks.

      Relevance: Alcoholism is a devastating chronic disorder that in any one year affects 10% of
      adults, costs over $185 billion, and causes more than 100,000 deaths in the U.S. Despite
      treatment, most alcoholic patients achieve only short-term abstinence. Medically-based
      treatment improvements are needed that target neurophysiologic mechanisms of relapse. Overall
      public health will be improved by developing science-based treatments that can augment
      existing, but only partially effective, treatment approaches.

NCT01013883,The Darlington Retrospective Outpatient Study,"
      Having heart failure means the heart is unable to pump blood around the body effectively.
      This reduces life expectancy and hinders normal daily activities. Heart failure affects about
      one million people in the UK; it is a major cause of death but it is often undetected and
      under-treated. If diagnosed and treated properly, the symptoms of heart failure can be well
      controlled and the length and quality of life can be improved.

      Two drugs (called ACE-inhibitors and beta-blockers) help patients to live longer and suffer
      fewer consequences of heart failure. These drugs should be offered to all patients although
      this does not happen consistently for a variety of reasons. Doctors specialising in heart
      failure may help patients make better informed decisions about treatments and other aspects
      of care.

      the more than 1.5 million people who experience a traumatic brain injury (TBI) each year in
      the United States, as many as 75% sustain a mild TBI which can cause long-term or permanent
      impairments/disabilities in a significant proportion of patients. In addition, traumatic
      brain injury has become a signature injury of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. For people
      with these injuries, it is difficult to determine whether symptoms are due to the head injury
      or another condition, such as Post-traumatic Stress Disorder. In this project, there are 3
      observational studies that involve testing of mental functions and behavior, imaging of the
      brain with special x-ray procedures, and blood samples to look at glandular function, which
      may be affected by head injury. A fourth study is a test of a drug, atorvastatin, which may
      provide protection for injured brain cells and improve outcome. By collecting and analyzing
      the information from these tests, it will be possible to make the process of diagnosing mild
      TBI or post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) more precise, and also to see if atorvastatin is
      a helpful drug for patients with MTBI.

      among children.

      A follow-up study will be conducted on 267 children and will allow comparison between
      children that developed overweight with the ones who did not. Subjects will be requited at 10
      years of age from a previous project. These children have been studied when they were 6-18
      months old and a follow-up was conducted at 4 years of age. Sixteen percent of the children
      were overweight at 4 years of age and retrospective data of e.g. food intake, blood lipids
      and anthropometric measurements exists. In the present follow-up data regarding food and
      physical activity habits, anthropometric measurements and blood samples of e.g. blood lipids,

NCT01012336,"Safety and Efficacy of Aprepitant, Ramosetron, and Dexamethasone for Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting in Patients With Ovarian Cancer Treated With Taxane/Carboplatin","
      The current recommended guideline for patients receiving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy
      (MEC) is the combination of a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist and corticosteroid. Incidence of
      chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is approximately 50% in patients receiving
      MEC. An incidence rate of 25-38% for delayed emesis and 55-60% for delayed nausea has been
      observed. Hence, there is clearly a need for more effective prevention of CINV in patients
      receiving MEC, especially in women with ovarian carcinoma who are particularly susceptible to
      these symptoms. Therefore the investigators designed a study with the objective to evaluate
      if new combination (Aprepitant/Ramosetron/Dexamethasone) may improve actual CINV control in

      There has not been any systemic therapy approved in the United States or in Europe for
      treating advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer (EC). This study will evaluate the safety
      and preliminary efficacy of XL147 in advanced or recurrent EC.

      Constitutively active phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/phosphatase and tensin homolog on
      chromosome 10 (PTEN) pathway signaling is common in EC and involved in the development and/or
      progression of the disease. PTEN deficiency and/or activating mutations/amplification in the
      PIK3CA gene that encodes the p110α catalytic subunit of PI3K have been frequently detected in
      EC patients. XL147 is a potent and highly selective inhibitor of the Class I PI3K family of
      lipid kinases. In addition, in vivo preclinical data have demonstrated that XL147 targets
      both proximal and distal signaling in the PI3K/PTEN pathway. Therefore, XL147 may have
      utility in the treatment of subjects with advanced or recurrent EC.

NCT01016041,A Trial of Everolimus-eluting Stents and Paclitaxel-eluting Stents for Coronary Revascularization in Daily Practice: The COMPARE Trial,"
      Instead of treating in-stent restenosis, the best strategy for patients is preventing
      in-stent restenosis. Recent advances in the understanding of the cellular mechanism
      responsible for smooth muscle cell proliferation (neointimal hyperplasia), together with
      improvement in stent coating and eluting technology have provided the scientific background
      to develop drug eluting stents. Drug eluting stents (DES) are now the most promising
      development in interventional cardiology. Different classes of drugs mounted in a polymer
      layer on the surface of the stent have shown to be very effective in preventing neointimal
      hyperplasia. Currently there are 7 DES stents CE marked and commercially available on the
      market. Two stents, respectively the sirolimus eluting Cypher™ stent and the paclitaxel
      eluting Taxus™ stent, are in clinical use since 2002. The Cypher™ stent consists of the Bx
      sonic stent/balloon platform. The stent is coated with a non-degradable biocompatible
      PBMA/PEVA polymer which elutes sirolimius. The Taxus™ stent consists of the Express2
      balloon/stent platform coated with non-degradable biocompatible Translute™ polymer which
      elutes paclitaxel.

      Recent large randomized trials like RAVEL, SIRIUS, E-SIRIUS C-SIRIUS (Cypher™ versus bare
      metal BX sonic™ stent), TAXUS II, IV, V, VI (Taxus versus bare metal Express™ stent) have
      shown that DES dramatically reduce the incidence of in-stent restenosis and subsequently the
      need for target lesion revascularization in patients with non complex and moderate long
      de-novo coronary lesions in vessels with a diameter between 2.5 -3.5 mm.1-11 Considering the
      very encouraging results of these early clinical trials with so far mid long term follow-up,
      there is the need to explore the utilization of DES in the other subsets of coronary lesions
      like: long lesions, chronic total occlusions, venous graft lesions, thrombotic lesions,
      restenosis lesions, ostial and bifurcation lesions and lesions in large vessels.

      As the result from the previous reported randomized trials, FDA and other regulatory
      institutes require that new DES are now being evaluated against one of the former DES (Cypher
      or Taxus). The XIENCE-V stent is a second generation DES, with thinner and more flexible
      Cobalt-Chromium stent struts, compared to the first generation Stainless Steel stent struts
      of Cypher and Taxus. This study addresses the questions whether the XIENCE-V™ stent has
      superior clinical results as the Taxus™ stent in the general population that is being
      referred for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

      Objective of the study:

      The main objective of the study is a head tot head comparison of the everolimus coated
      XIENCE-V™ stent with the paclitaxel coated TAXUS™ stent in order to observe whether there is
      a difference in clinical outcome between both stents.

      Efficacy of both stents will be assessed by the composite end point of: all death, non fatal
      myocardial infarction and target vessel revascularization.

      Study design:

      Single center, randomised, open label study in all-comers referred for PCI.

      Study population:

      Approximately 1600 consecutive patients with coronary artery disease who are eligible
      according to the in- and exclusion criteria will be enrolled and randomized on a 1:1 basis.

      Primary study parameters/outcome of the study:

      The primary end point of the study is the composite end point of: all death, non fatal
      myocardial infarction, target vessel revascularization at 1 year.

      Secondary study parameters/outcome of the study:

      The secondary end points of the study are:

      A) The combined endpoint of cardiac death, non fatal myocardial infarction, ischemic driven
      target lesion revascularization (TLR) rate at 1, 6 and 12 months follow-up.

      B) The combined endpoint of all death, non fatal myocardial infarction, target vessel
      revascularization (TVR) rate at 2, 3, 4 and 5 years.

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness:

      The burden for the patient consists of filling in 8 questionnaires (1 A4 per questionnaire)
      in 5 years time.

      The first 3 questionnaires in the first year are also requested for monitoring purposes by
      the Ministry of Health and the Dutch Cardiology Society (Nederlandse Vereniging Voor

      There is no risk for the patient related to participation in this study. The patient will
      receive a Taxus or Xience-V stent anyhow, if the indication for a DES stent exists.

      Background: Bacterial colonization of peripheral nerve catheters is frequent, although
      infection is relatively rare. With central venous catheters, the tunneling of catheter into
      the subcutaneous tissue significantly decreases catheter colonization and catheter-related
      sepsis.

      Purpose: The aim of this study is to evaluate the incidence of bacterial colonization in
      adult patients with femoral tunnelized perineural nerve catheters.

      Methods: A total of 338 patients with femoral catheter will be included in the study. The
      patients will be randomized to be included in the control group (without tunnelling) or in
      the group with catheter tunneled 2-3 cm subcutaneously. After removal, catheter will be

NCT01018381,Arabinoxylan Rice Bran (MGN-3/Biobran) for the Treatment of Hepatocellular Carcinoma and Hepatitis B and C Infection,"
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common cancer worldwide with an estimated
      626,000 new cases per year worldwide, accounting for 5.7% of new cancer cases. Although
      resection and transplantation offer the best 5-year survival rates, not all patients are
      suitable surgery candidates. Other treatments include pericutaneous ethanol injection (PEI),
      radiofrequency ablation (RFA), and transarterial oily chemoembolization (TOCE), all of which
      enhance the survival rate and aid in shrinkage of the tumor. The very low survival rate among
      HCC patients, 3-5%, reflects the inadequacy of conventional therapies for the disease and
      highlights the necessity of finding new treatments or modifying the current treatment.

      The hepatitis B virus (HBV) causes liver disease that can range in severity from a mild
      illness that lasts several weeks (acute hepatitis B) to a long-term chronic illness. An
      estimated 2 billion people have been infected with HBV worldwide, resulting in more than 350
      million individuals with chronic, long-term liver infections. Patients with chronic HBV
      infection are at a great risk for the development of cirrhosis, hepatic failure, and HCC.
      There is no cure for hepatitis B and care is mostly palliative. There are several anti-viral
      and interferon drugs, such as Entecavir and Interferon α therapy, which can help some
      patients. However, these drugs are costly, thousands of dollars per year, and are not widely
      available in many countries, especially in the developing world. Vaccination is available and
      effective and is recommended for all individuals at risk for HBV infection. However,
      vaccination is only effective in individuals who have not been exposed to HBV. Hepatitis B is
      closely linked to liver cancer, which is almost always fatal.

      MGN-3/Biobran is an arabinoxylan extracted from rice bran that is treated enzymatically with
      an extract from Shiitake mushrooms. MGN-3 demonstrated anti-cancer activity in vivo in mice
      and humans. The present study was carried out to examine whether combining the current
      conventional treatment with a food supplement, arabinoxylan rice bran (MGN-3/Biobran), may
      improve the outcome of the disease and increase the survival rate of patients with HCC or
      HBV. We hypothesize that a combinatory treatment of conventional therapy with MGN-3/Biobran
      will augment the therapeutic effect seen when patients are treated with conventional therapy
      alone.

NCT01019200,Serum Lipid Levels and Other Biomarkers of Cardiovascular Disease in Patients With Psoriasis,"
      Psoriasis patients are known to be at increased risk for heart disease. This may be due to
      the increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease risk factors in this population, including
      high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, and high cholesterol. Although cholesterol levels are
      known to be altered in psoriasis, most studies have used standard lipid profiles to measure
      cholesterol. These tests indirectly measure LDL (bad cholesterol) and become less accurate
      when triglyceride levels are high, as often see in individuals with psoriasis. We have
      designed a case-control study that uses a more specific and detailed cholesterol test to
      measure serum lipid levels in psoriasis patients, allowing for more accurate determination of
      LDL and better assessment of the lipid-contribution to cardiovascular risk. We will also
      measure other markers of inflammation that may contribute to cardiovascular disease.

      Background:

        -  Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a common childhood disorder that often does not
           respond to standard treatments. Researchers are exploring the role that a brain chemical
           called glutamate plays in symptoms of OCD, and are testing a drug called riluzole that
           reduces glutamate to see if changing the levels of glutamate in the brain will help
           treat the disorder.

        -  Researchers are interested in using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), a type of
           magnetic imaging, to take pictures of various chemicals in the brain. MRS images will be
           used to detect changes in brain levels of glutamate in children taking riluzole.

      Objectives:

      - To use magnetic resonance spectroscopy to study the levels of glutamate in the brains of
      children and adolescents who have been taking riluzole.

      Eligibility:

      - Children and adolescents ages 7 to 17 who are enrolled in the current NIMH riluzole trial
      protocol (05-M-0225), who are able to lie still in the scanner for about an hour each time,
      and who are willing to have up to three MRS scans.

      Design:

        -  Researchers will study some children/adolescents before they begin to take the study
           medication riluzole or placebo these children will have an MRS scan before starting the
           study medication. The scan will take about an hour.

        -  About 2 weeks after reaching the full dose on the study medication, participants will
           have a second hour-long MRS scan. Participants will have a third MRS scan after being on
           the study medication for 12 weeks.

        -  Some children who have already completed 12 weeks on riluzole or placebo, and are now

      ichthyosis vulgaris. Atopic dermatitis, or eczema, is a common, chronic, relapsing and
      remitting problem in many children and affects 10-20% of the pediatric population. Itch is a
      predominant feature of this disease and is quite disruptive to daily activities of life. In
      addition to itch, it is characterized by markedly dry skin, small red bumps that may have
      fluid. Ichthyosis vulgaris is characterized by extremely dry, scaly skin with a fine white
      scale and increased amounts of lines noted on the palms. Filaggrin is a protein that is
      essential for the skin to function properly as a barrier and found to be mutated in some
      European patients with ichthyosis vulgaris and atopic dermatitis. This association has not

      Mammalian fetal sensory development comes in an invariant series, with the
      tactile/kinesthetic and chemosensory systems the earliest functioning and responsive to
      stimulation, implicating the importance of these foundational sensory systems for later
      development. Olfaction is essential for neonatal behavioral adaptation in many mammals,
      including humans. Experiments show that newborns recognize, and are soothed by, the smell of
      amniotic fluid. Provision of the mother's smell with breast pads, handkerchiefs she has worn,
      breast milk on a cotton ball or cotton applicator, or other means of providing odor and taste
      input can facilitate recognition by the infant's mother at a later time and does not appear
      to be detrimental to the stability of the infant.

      Provision of the odor and taste of the mother's milk has been shown to facilitate the
      infant's mouthing, sucking, arousal, and calming from irritability, especially in preparation
      for oral feeding. Using 24 hour monitor analysis and cortisol saliva measurements, we will

NCT01010412,Ultrasound Visualization Versus Electrical Nerve Stimulation,"
      Hypothesis and Specific Aims:

      The investigators hypothesize that ultrasound (US) visualization is as effective as nerve
      stimulation (NS) for identification of peripheral nervous structures and may be associated
      with less trauma and patient discomfort. Specifically, the investigators believe that
      equivalent rates of surgical anesthesia are achievable with non-invasive ultrasonic needle
      guidance in comparison to needle guidance by intensity of motor fiber response to
      intermittent electrical nerve stimulation. Specifically, the number of needle sticks to
      identify the brachial plexus and total time to plexus sheath injection may be reduced while
      achieving similar efficacy rates. The investigators hypothesize that similar composite safety
      and efficacy endpoints but improved patient satisfaction and acceptance will favor US over NS
      guidance of nerve blocks indicated for surgery on the extremity surgery. However, the
      investigators believe that an economic assessment based upon capital hardware investment,
      operating room utilization, total block time, and pay for performance patient satisfaction
      metrics require examination prior to assimilation of new technology into clinical practice.

      Evidence exists that the activation of actions activates the same cortical motor areas that
      are involved in the performance of the observed actions. The neural substrate for this
      phenomena is the mirror neuron system. It is generally assumed that mirror neurons have a
      basic role in understanding the intentions of others and in imitation learning. There is
      evidence that action observation has a positive effect on rehabilitation of motor disorders
      after stroke. The aim of this study is to demonstrate that action observation followed by the
      repetition of the actions previously observed has a positive impact on rehabilitation of the
      upper limb in children affected by hemiplegia as a consequence of Cerebral Palsy. In
      particular, the purpose is to assess if mirror neurons could improve the amount, the quality

      see how well they work compared with sorafenib tosylate alone in treating patients with liver
      cancer that has spread to nearby tissue or lymph nodes or has spread to other places in the
      body. Sorafenib tosylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy,
      such as doxorubicin hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,
      either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. It is not yet known whether
      giving sorafenib tosylate together with doxorubicin hydrochloride is more effective than

      structured quality improvement program, focused on increasing adherence to company wide
      anemia management policies (ie hemoglobin monitoring within the first 3-5 days
      post-hospitalization, followed by an appropriate EPO dose modification within the 7 days
      post-hospitalization), will significantly decrease the risk of hospital re-admission in the

NCT01011348,Q10 for Gulf War Veterans,"
      Goal: The investigators propose to test whether giving the supplement coenzyme Q10 (Q10)
      improves symptoms and subjective health in Gulf War veterans (GWV) with chronic,
      multi-symptom health problems.

      Rationale: Direct empirical evidence, in groups that are not GWV, has supported benefit of
      Q10 to many of the symptoms that GWV are at heightened risk of experiencing - such as
      fatigue, muscle pain, and cognition, which are syndrome-defining conditions. In addition, Q10
      has also been reported to benefit other symptoms arising at increased rates in GWV, including
      headaches, sleep disturbances, and breathing problems. This provides a strong rationale for
      testing whether Q10 will have similar benefit to these symptoms in GWV.

      Method: 46 GWV with chronic health problems will participate.The design is a randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study. Each subject will be ""crossed over"" between
      Q10 and an identical placebo, receiving each agent twice, for 3.5 month periods. In one of
      the Q10 phases, a lower dose of Q10 will be used - 100mg three times a day; while in one a
      higher dose will be used - 300mg three times a day. Neither subjects nor investigators will
      know which substance each subject is receiving in which phase. Subjects will be randomly
      assigned to one of four crossover orders.

      Assessments: Assessments will include subjective quality of life; symptoms that are ""syndrome
      defining"" for Gulf War illness (like fatigue and muscle problems); and other symptoms and
      conditions reported to occur more commonly in GWV (like sleep problems). Analyses will show
      whether Q10 led to improvements when compared to placebo; whether higher Q10 doses improved
      outcomes more than lower doses; and whether people with certain symptoms or characteristics
      get more benefit than people with other symptoms or characteristics.

NCT01012583,Optical Coherence TomOgraphy Assessment of the Drug-Eluting Stent,"
      BACKGROUND Treatment of coronary atherosclerotic disease has been significantly advanced by
      interventional cardiology, and the advent of coronary arterial stents. In comparison to
      angioplasty alone, stents have reduced the incidence of angiographic as well as clinical
      restenosis, the recurrence of angina, the need for coronary arterial bypass graft (CABG)
      surgery, repeat revascularization and the occurrence of major adverse cardiac events
      (MACE).However the long-term success of this therapy has been limited by the occurrence of
      in-stent restenosis. Despite the effectiveness of intracoronary stents in maintaining a
      larger luminal diameter, as compared to angioplasty alone, in-stent restenosis occurs within
      6 to 9 months after stent placement in 15% to 35% of patients. While stents can reduce
      restenosis by blocking vascular recoil and remodeling, mechanical intervention alone has been
      incapable of treating this biological problem of neointimal hyperplasia, particularly in the
      subset of patients with diabetes, long lesions or small vessel disease.Drug-eluting stents
      (DES) were developed as a viable method for focused delivery of anti-restenosis compounds to
      target lesions for the reduction of restenosis. Of the DES available and with the results of
      up to six (6) years clinical follow-up, the sirolimus-eluting stent (SES) has become the
      current gold standard for stent implantation. With the advent of using DES to treat complex
      lesions such as longer lesions requiring the use of multiple stents and the use in
      bifurcation lesions, the risk of stent thrombosis has increase.Late stent thrombosis has also
      been reported following DES implantation.Long term treatment with dual anti-platelet therapy
      following stent implantation has become the solution used to counteract the risk of stent
      thrombosis, this solution does not come without it's own risks and is an expensive therapy.
      Another specific problem of DES is delayed endothelization, and this may be and attributing
      factor in prolonging the period of thrombotic risk as shown by pathological findings at
      autopsy following SES implantation. These examinations have shown that even after 16 months,
      neointimal healing is still incomplete with approximately 20% of stent struts being found
      uncovered. Questions have arose that the problems of late thrombosis and delayed
      endothelization of stent struts with DES could be the result of the permanent polymer that is
      used as the bonding agent for the anti-restenosis compounds to the stents.Intravascular
      Ultrasound (IVUS) along with angiography has been the techniques used to gain data on DES to
      this point. Angiography is a 2 dimensional tool that gives a view of the vessel and IVUS
      gives a more 3 dimensional view of the vessel. IVUS does have its limitations, as stent
      struts are reflectors of sonic waves, shadowing around and behind the struts occurs. IVUS is
      also limited in detecting malapposition of the struts to the vessel wall especially if the
      area between the vessel wall and the strut in very small.

      RATIONALE Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is an optical analogue of IVUS that uses an
      infrared light source and measures the backscatter of the light. With this technique a higher
      level of resolution compared with IVUS has been reported.OCT has been reported as being able
      to visualize and detect atherosclerotic plaques and assess more accurately strut
      malapposition and the presence or thickness of neointimal hyperplasia as compared to IVUS.
      With the question of delayed endothelization due to the permanent polymer being a probable
      risk for late stent thrombosis, it is felt that OCT post stent implantation may give a more
      accurate assessment of stent strut endothelial coverage.

      This study is designed to compare the intimal hyperplasia following implantation of the Excel
      DES with a biodegradable polymer vs. the Cypher DES with a permanent polymer using OCT.

NCT01016431,Effects of Atrial Rate-adaptive Pacing on Exercise Capacity in Patients With Chronic Heart Failure Complicated by Chronotropic Incompetence,"
      Chronotropic incompetence consists of an insufficient increase in heart rate during effort,
      and its presence is recognized as a common feature in patients with heart failure due to left
      ventricular systolic dysfunction, apparently suggesting a worse prognosis. Little is known
      about the possible benefits of its reversal in such patients.

      The investigators working hypothesis is that the modulation of chronotropic response, as
      obtained by means of atrial rate-adaptive pacing may improve functional capacity in persons
      with chronic heart failure and chronotropic incompetence.

      To explore this hypothesis,the investigators will enroll 20 patients with NYHA II/III heart
      failure, low left ventricular ejection fraction (<40%) and chronotropic incompetence (Maximal
      heart rate <80% of predicted value in a symptom-limited incremental test), who already
      underwent implantation of dual-chamber implantable defibrillator for prevention of sudden
      cardiac death. The study will have a randomized, double-blind, cross-over design.

      The procedures, to be carried out at one month from each reprogramming (VVI backup pacing vs.
      AAI-R ""active"" pacing), will comprise: blood sampling for NT-proBNP, incremental
      symptom-limited cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPX), constant-workload cardiopulmonary
      test (50% of max WR), quality-of-life questionnaire, 24-hour ECG monitoring.

      The primary end-point will be peak oxygen consumption on CPX. Secondary end-points will

NCT01014234,Rapamycin and Regulatory T Cells in Kidney Transplantation,"
      The immune system response is mediated by the interaction between the antigen presenting cell
      (APC), CD4+ T helper cells (Th) and CD4+ CD25+ regulatory T cells, a subgroup of CD4+ T cell
      which express IL-2 receptor (CD25) and the transcriptional factor foxp3. Regulatory T cell
      may contribute to the maintenance of tolerance by suppressing the immune response to normal
      or tumor associated antigens.

      Regulatory T cell emerge from the thymus during ontogenesis and they represent about 10 % of
      the peripheral Cd4+ t cells.

      Rapamycin is one the most use treatment to prevent renal allograft failure. Differently from
      calcineurin inhibitors (cyclosporine and tacrolimus), that inhibit T-cell activation through
      the inhibition of calcineurin activation, rapamycin inhibits cellular proliferation by
      impairing the progression of the cellular cycle, in particular by interaction with mTOR.
      Recently Battaglia et al. have demonstrated a Treg amplification in murine CD4+ lymphocytes
      treated with rapamycin in vitro.

      Aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of different immunosuppressive regimens on

NCT01018056,Developing New Treatments for Tourette Syndrome: Therapeutic Trials With Modulators of Glutamatergic Neurotransmission,"
      A joint NIH -Tourette Syndrome Association Conference has emphasized the critical need for
      the testing and development of new pharmacotherapy for tic suppression in Tourette syndrome
      (TS). This submission is a safety, tolerability and efficacy pilot study using two
      medications that modulate glutamate neurotransmission, riluzole, a glutamate antagonist, and
      D-serine, a glutamate agonist. Glutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the
      central nervous system, an essential component of pathways implicated in TS and an extensive
      modulator of dopamine, the major neurotransmitter associated with tics.

      This is a single site, short-term, proof of concept study of riluzole and D-serine for the
      treatment of tics. Each medication will be evaluated and compared to placebo as part of a
      double-blind, randomized, parallel, flexible dose, three-arm, 8-week, treatment protocol
      (D-serine, riluzole, or placebo). A total of sixty patients (age 8-17 years) with TS and
      moderate to moderately-severe tics will receive study medication according to a 2:1 (dopamine
      modulating drug: placebo), randomized schedule, i.e., riluzole (n=24), D-serine (n=24),
      placebo (n=12). The primary outcome measure is tic suppression as determined by changes in
      the Total Tic Subscore of the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS). Secondary tic outcome
      measures include changes in the YGTSS Total Score and two Global Impression Scales. Further,
      since both riluzole and D-serine have been proposed as treatments for obsessive-compulsive
      behaviors, a TS co-morbidity, these symptoms will be followed. Safety measures include serial
      physical examinations, vital signs, laboratory studies (comprehensive metabolic panel,
      complete blood count, plasma amino acids, and urine analyses), documentation of side effects
      and adverse events, and measurement of changes in ADHD, depression and anxiety.

      This pilot investigation will provide important proof-of-concept data on glutamate therapies
      for TS and, in turn, evidence for large-scale, multi-center clinical trials.

NCT01019798,"Salvage Therapy With Sunitinib,Docetaxel and Platinum on Metastatic or Unresectable Non Small Cell Lung Cancer","
      Sunitinib shows anti-tumor activity in a variety of human non-small cell lung tumor ex vivo
      models. Many Phases II and III clinical trials of sunitinib in several solid tumors are
      completed or still ongoing. So far, the efficacy of sunitinb has been confirmed by the phase
      III trial for imatinib-resistance or intolerance advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumor
      patients. And sutent was approved to effective by two phase II trials in advanced renal cell
      carcinoma patients after failure of immunotherapies, and one phase III trial in
      treatment-naive advanced renal carcinoma patients. Sunitinib (SUTENT ®) has been approved by
      U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of advanced renal carcinoma
      patients and in gastrointestinal stromal tumor patients who are intolerant or progressed
      after imatinib mesylate. European Medicines Agency (EMEA) conditionally granted the marketing
      approval for the treatment of metastatic renal carcinoma patients after failure of
      immunotherapy.

      A phase II trial (A6181040 study) on non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with
      sunitinib alone showed anti-tumor activity. In 63 enrolled patients treated with 4/2 schedule
      (4 weeks treatment, then two weeks interruption), 7 patients are confirmed partial response
      (overall response rate, 11%), and median progress-free time is 14.3 weeks. Presently, a phase
      III study is underway on non-small cell lung cancer patients followed by and now is under
      recruiting.

      Non-small cell lung cancer cells often over-express vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
      receptors. Besides, the expression of the VEGF ligands is also correlated with increased
      tumor angiogenesis, as well as shortened survival time. One study treated with VEGF-directed
      monoclonal antibody (bevacizumab) and VEGFR and platelet-derived growth factor receptor
      (PDGFR) small molecule inhibitors (sunitinib) showed that some non-small cell lung cancer
      patients are with anti-tumor activity.

      The chemotherapy drugs, such as docetaxel and platinum-based compounds, were with evidence
      that they have direct cytotoxicity to cancer cells. Therefore, the investigators are paying
      attention to the efficacy of combining sunitinib and conventional chemotherapy in this study.

      The study is designed as first line of salvage therapy on metastatic or unresectable
      non-small cell lung cancer patients. The main goals of this study is to evaluate the overall
      response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DR) of sunitinib in combinational with
      docetaxel and cisplatin in chemotherapy-naive advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung
      cancer patients.

      pulmonary tuberculosis in patients suspected of pulmonary tuberculosis in whom the three
      classic (non-induced) sputum samples didn't show tuberculous bacillus on direct examination.

      The investigators compare the sensibility of induced sputum technique with an endoscopic
      approach (CT-scan followed by BAL and fluoroscopy-guided transbronchial biopsies and
      eventually sputum collection immediately after the bronchoscopy).

      People in high risk population for tuberculosis undergoing screening by chest X-ray or
      symptomatic patients will be admitted to the hospital if their chest X-ray shows a suspicion
      of active tuberculosis.

      According good clinical practice: (non-induced) sputum samples will be taken at admission and
      every following morning. If direct examination and PCR of the first three classic sputum
      samples are negative: patients will be randomised in two groups with a different diagnostic
      approach (induced sputum versus endoscopic approach) The aim of our study is to proof that a
      thoroughgoing endoscopic approach has a higher sensibility than an induced sputum in the
      diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis in patients with a high suspicion of active tuberculosis
      on the chest X-ray but with a negative direct examination and/or PCR on three consecutive
      normal sputum samples.

      The investigators will include 154 patients (based on a statistical analysis for a hypothesis
      that the endoscopic approach has a sensibility that's twice the sensibility of the induced
      sputum).

NCT01018316,UMOX - New Device for Oropharyngeal Preoxygenation,"
      The UMOX is a device that has been designed as an alternative to the conventional face mask
      for preoxygenation to be used when an optimal preoxygenation with a facemask is difficult to
      achieve(i.e: when a leak is present. A previous study in our hospital (unpublished data) has
      shown that the UMOX was only as effective as the conventional mask when a nose clip was used
      to prevent the patients from breathing in some air through the nose, thus preventing the
      dilution/contamination of the 100% oxygen delivered.In that study, the verbal indication
      giving to the subjects to breathe through the mouth was better than no indication at all but
      still yielded unsatisfactory results.

      For this reason, the present study was designed to verify the hypothesis that while using the
      UMOX for preoxygenation, the verbal indication of breathing 8 vital capacity breaths added to
      the indication of breathing through the mouth would bring equivalent results -measured by the
      expired fraction of oxygen- as a preoxygenation of normal tidal breathing through a facemask
      during 3 to 5 minutes.

      Preoxygenation was performed with the 60 volunteers placed in the supine position with 100%
      oxygen. All volunteers went though preoxygenation with two techniques: 1) breathing normal
      tidal volumes at a normal respiratory rate for a period of 5 minutes through a tight fitting
      conventional face mask, and 2) eight deep breaths (i.e. vital capacity breaths) through the
      UMOX device with verbal indication to use only the mouth to breathe.

      Bronchiolitis is a lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) syndrome cause by different types
      of viruses and occurs in young children. Although bronchiolitis is a widespread and fairly
      common illness in children, pediatricians vary significantly in how it is treated. This
      includes how children are monitored for their oxygen status when not receiving supplemental
      oxygen. Studies suggest that continuous pulse oximetry measurement of children admitted to
      the hospital with bronchiolitis regardless of use of supplemental oxygen prolongs their
      hospital stay. This increases the cost of care for these patients and increases their risk of
      hospital-associated complications.

      This study is a randomized trial of continuous pulse oximeter use in patients admitted with
      bronchiolitis versus transitioning patients not requiring oxygen to intermittent pulse
      oximetry monitoring. The investigators hypothesize that this will decrease length of stay as

NCT01017484,Mechanism of the Blood Pressure Lowering Effect of the DASH Dietary Pattern,"
      Understanding the possible mechanism(s) by which the DASH dietary pattern lowers blood
      pressure will potentially enhance the value of this dietary intervention by elucidating the
      conditions under which it will be most effective, identifying target populations, examining
      its impact on vascular health beyond blood pressure, and enhancing the investigators'
      understanding of the interactions among diet, blood pressure and vascular function. In
      addition, results of this study may help to identify additional therapeutic targets.
      Therefore, the overall goal of the proposed study is to determine the mechanism(s) by which
      the DASH dietary pattern lowers blood pressure by using a controlled feeding design.

      The study involves approximately 105 adolescent (ages 12-17) subjects to be screened at 4
      sites across the US. All subjects enrolled will treat up to 4 MILD migraines over a 6 month
      period. They will be required to have three office visits during the six months. All subjects
      will be randomized to either Treximet (85mg Imitrex/500mg Naproxen Sodium) or Placebo
      (sugar-pill) in four of the five treatment arms with a 3 to 1 ratio. A fifth treatment arm
      will treat all 4 migraines with active drug, Treximet. The hypothesis is that Treximet will
      prove to be a safe and effective treatment for this population, that has so few treatment for
      migraine. And Treximet will be superior over placebo for pain free endpoints at 2 and 24

NCT01011803,Correlation of Phonation With Deglutition and Aspiration Risk in the ICU Patients - an Exploratory Study,"
      Swallowing implies the appropriate use and sufficient function of specific muscles that are
      also used in speech. Theoretically, if these muscles are functionally affected then phonation
      and vocalization should be impaired, as well. The purpose of this study is to examine the
      relationship between functions of speech and risk of aspiration as defined by swallowing
      function, and to investigate the diagnostic potential that functions of speech may have in
      predicting the risk of aspiration. This could allow for earlier stratification of ICU
      patients for aspiration risks. Aspiration pneumonia has been reported in more than 20% of
      patients with health care-associated pneumonia. There are multiple tools to assess for risk
      of aspiration in the ICU, yet these are time consuming, often delayed and involve advanced
      testing that is performed by a certified speech-language pathologist and/or radiologist. A
      novel 3-step phonetic evaluation was created and will be implemented on ICU patients at risk
      for aspiration, and the results will be correlated to the standard swallowing tests. If
      strong correlation is found in this pilot study, then formal clinical trial will follow to
      confirm that the simple bed-side phonetic evaluation could allow for earlier identification
      of patients at risk for aspiration, and more efficient management relative to time and
      resources utilization.

NCT01014260,Doxycycline Outcomes in Lupus Erythematosus,"
      Cardiovascular disease, specifically from atherosclerosis, is the major cause of mortality in
      SLE in developed countries. In a recent study the investigators have shown that high
      sensitivity C reactive protein (hs-CRP) is higher in SLE patients with (versus without)
      coronary calcium, a measure of subclinical atherosclerosis. In an ongoing two year
      intervention trial of atorvastatin, the investigators will determine if statins retard
      coronary calcium and reduce hs-CRP. However, 10% of the patients in the trial were intolerant
      of statins. The investigators want to now investigate whether there are additional, and
      potentially safer ways, to reduce hs-CRP in SLE. In this study, the investigators will
      determine if doxycycline reduces hs-CRP and other vascular inflammatory markers including
      interleukin 6 (IL-6), soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule (sVCAM-1), soluble inter cell

NCT01014026,Self-sampling and Human Papillomavirus (HPV)-Testing for Unscreened Women in Cervical Cancer Prevention,"
      Scientific Context

      High-risk types of human papillomavirus (HPV) are the causative agents for cervical cancer.
      Cervical cancer screening strategies rely on periodic Papanicolaou (Pap) testing. It's
      well-known that this test has significantly contributed to the reduction of mortality and
      morbidity due to cervical cancer. In France, it now seems that the screening strategy could
      be optimized. The two main ways are to reach the 7 million underscreened women (mass
      screening, self-sampling for HPV DNA testing) and to improve the screening test (HPV DNA
      testing, computer-assisted cytology). Self-collected vaginal samples (SCVS) for HPV DNA
      testing could be a relevant screening option: this technique appears reliable and it could
      allow to reach women who are never or seldom screened. Currently, there is no French data on
      the SCVS for HPV DNA testing.

      The goal of this study is to determine the performance and acceptability of a
      population-based strategy using self-collected vaginal samples for HPV DNA testing to reach
      women who are not participating in cervical cancer screening.

      Description of the project

      This project (APACHE-1) is a part of a project called APACHE. APACHE-1 will be dedicated to
      the SCVS technical validation and to the comparison between different transports medium. Nine
      hundred women will be recruited from the 20 to 65 years consultants in the Tours University
      Hospital (CHRU of Tours) and in the IRSA (health centre for routine medical checkup).

      Each woman will collect 2 SCVS with a nylon flocked swab (Copan® microRheologics™). The first
      SCVS will be put in a vial which contains a liquid medium. The second SCVS will be put in a
      dry vial. Then during the speculum examination the physician will collect a cervical sample
      with a Rovers® Cervex-Brush™ and then rinse it into a vial containing PréservCyt ™. A blind
      HPV DNA testing and genotyping (Inno-LIPA HPV Genotyping ™ Extra) will be performed in the
      virology laboratory of the CHRU of Tours on all samples (SCVSs and cervical samples performed
      by a physician). The performance of the SCVS to detect cervical HPV infection will be
      assessed (gold standard test = HPV DNA testing on cervical samples collected by the
      physician).

      In a second time (APACHE-2), the researchers will investigate to what extent offering home
      obtained SCVS leads to participation of unscreened women. APACHE-2 will be registered on
      Clinicaltrials as another project.

        1. To determine whether people with schizophrenia treated with adjunctive oxytocin,
           compared to placebo, will show greater improvement on markers of negative symptom
           liability including: social affiliation, facial affect recognition, olfactory
           discrimination, initiation of smooth pursuit and latency of internally-driven saccades.

        2. To determine whether people with schizophrenia treated with adjunctive Galantamine,
           compared to placebo, will show greater improvement on markers of cognitive impairment
           liability including: predictive pursuit, P50 sensory gating and visual-spatial working
           memory.

      The investigators will address the following exploratory aims:

        1. To determine whether changes in markers of negative symptom liability are correlated
           with changes in SANS total score.

        2. To determine whether changes in markers of cognitive impairment liability are correlated
           with changes in the composite neurocognitive score.

        3. To determine the response to oxytocin of all cognition domains assessed by the MATRICS
           battery, and to determine the response to Galantamine of all cognition domains assessed
           by the MATRICS, which are not included in the primary neurocognitive outcome score.

NCT01014741,Modified Ablation Guided by Ibutilide Use in Chronic Atrial Fibrillation,"
      Procedures for ablation of persistent or long lasting atrial fibrillation are frequently long
      and require extensive ablation. Some electrophysiologists administer the drug ibutilide
      during these procedures to help organize the fibrillatory activity of the left atrium with
      the hope that this may shorten the length of the procedure and duration of ablation needed.
      Currently there is no standardized approach of administering the drug ibutilide during these
      procedures, thus the investigators cannot be certain that administering this drug does in
      fact facilitate the procedure. The aim of the MAGIC-AF Trial is to see if administering a

NCT01011465,The Biology of Resilience,"
      Positive social relationships have consistently been associated with better health, although
      the neurobiological underpinnings of these observed effects remain largely unknown. The
      overall goal of the proposed work is to explore novel biological pathways that may explain
      how social relationships influence health. Recent theorizing suggests that the oxytocin
      system may underlie some of the observed beneficial effects. Four hypotheses will be
      examined:

        1. Oxytocin ameliorates the deleterious neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and subjective
           effects of stress.

        2. Oxytocin and social support have similar and additive stress-buffering effects.

        3. Effects of oxytocin are evident among younger and older adults.

NCT01012700,Study to Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of Poly ICLC (Hiltonol) in Healthy Volunteers,"
      Vaccines induce protective immunity against numerous infectious diseases. However, current
      vaccines have limited efficacy against challenging infections like tuberculosis, malaria and
      HIV. Protein vaccines are safe but, typically, they induce weak T cell immunity when
      administered alone. Therefore, special attention is being given to adjuvants, which are
      enhancers of immunity, that mature antigen presenting immunostimulatory dendritic cells
      (DCs). Our goal is to study in humans the mechanism whereby synthetic adjuvants, acting on
      defined pattern recognition receptors (PRR), enhance T and B cell immunity. In preclinical
      studies, the investigators' laboratory has found in mice that poly IC and its analog poly
      ICLC are superior adjuvants for T cell mediated immunity relative to other agonists for PRR.
      In this study the investigators propose to study the safety and the innate immune responses
      to poly ICLC in multiple blood cell types, including three different subsets of DCs when
      administered subcutaneously or intranasally to healthy volunteers. Poly ICLC is a stabilized
      double stranded RNA which has been extensively studied in humans with a favorable safety

NCT01014403,Delayed Versus Early Enoxaparin Prophylaxis After Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI),"
      Brain injured patients are at high risk for forming blood clots in the legs and lungs. For
      non-brain injured trauma patients, we decrease the chances of these blood clots forming by
      placing the patients on a low dose of the blood thinner enoxaparin. Starting patients with a
      brain injury on the blood thinner is problematic, however, as this can theoretically cause
      the brain injury to worsen. Trauma surgeons wait a variable period of time before starting
      this blood thinner because waiting too long can result in the formation of these blood clots
      in the legs and lungs. Previous research has shown that some brain injuries which are of
      lower severity can have enoxaparin started at 24 hours after injury if the brain injury is
      stable on a repeated computed tomography (CT) scan of the head. This is a pilot study
      designed to look at the rates of worsening of brain injury if the low dose blood thinner is
      started at 24 versus 96 hours post-injury.

NCT01013220,Depression Management at the Workplace,"
      Randomized trials demonstrate that depression management products can improve clinical and
      organizational outcomes sufficiently for selected employers to realize a return on
      investment. Rather than usual care marketing which uses voltage-enhanced promises to sell
      voltage-diminished products, the investigators designed an evidence-based (EB) intervention
      to encourage employers to purchase a depression management product that offers the type,
      intensity and duration of care shown to provide clinical and organizational value. In an RCT
      designed to examine employer benefit purchasing behavior of depression products in 360
      employer members of over 20 regional business coalitions, the research team proposes: (a) to
      compare the impact of evidence-based (EB) to usual care (UC) presentations on employer
      benefit purchasing behavior, and (b) to identify mediators and organizational moderators of
      intervention impact on employer benefit purchasing behavior.

      This study addresses what policy analysts argue is one of the most pivotal problems in the
      translation of evidence-based care to 'real world' settings: whether purchasers can be
      influenced to buy health care products on the basis of value rather than cost. In the likely
      event that EB > UC, the study will provide encouragement to use an evidence-based approach to
      market new health care products to private payers on the basis of the product's clinical and
      organizational value. UC may achieve comparable outcomes to EB if the limiting factors in
      benefit purchasing are organizational, purchasing group and vendor constraints that no
      intervention can meaningfully modify. Support for this scenario would encourage the targeted
      marketing of new products to coalition members with empirically identified organizational,
      purchasing group and vendor characteristics, using usual care strategies.

      Myopia is the main reason of vision loss in the world which is seen in 30.4 million adults in
      USA (1). In a myopic eye, images are focused in front of retina because, cornea and
      crystalline lens become more powerful in focusing the image or the eye axis become too long
      (axial myopia) (2).

      Myopia prevalence in adolescents has been raised in recent years and nowadays it has reached
      to 10-25% and 60-80% in western and eastern countries respectively (3). Tehran eye study
      showed that the prevalence of myopia in Tehran is 21.8% and 17.2% based on manifest and
      cycloplegic refraction respectively (4). One study in Dezful, Iran showed that 3.7% of 7-15
      years old children are myopic (5).

      Today potential role of early life nutrition in myopia development in later life is becoming
      an attractive field of study. It has been shown that until weaning; breast milk is the main
      source of many nutrients [such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)] which are important for
      photoreceptors and cortical neuronal development (6). But results about the relationship
      between breastfeeding and likelihood of childhood myopia are controversial. A
      hypothesis-generating study (7) showed an independent and inverse relationship between
      breastfeeding and likelihood of myopia in 10-12 year old Singaporean children. However, data
      pulled from three English birth cohorts done in 10-11y and 15-16y children did not show any
      effect (8).

      To examine the association between breastfeeding pattern and likelihood of myopia in 6-7y
      children, a retrospective case-control study is designed in National Nutrition and Food
      Technology research Institute of Iran. This study will try to assess breastfeeding pattern
      and almost all cofactors which may relate to myopia.

NCT01013558,New Options for Preoperative Anesthesia in Intrauterine Needling,"
      The concept of fetal pain is becoming increasingly relevant due to growing possibilities for
      invasive intrauterine treatment. There is much debate as to whether the fetus is mature
      enough to be able to perceive pain at all. Recent studies have suggested that the fetus is at
      least capable of exhibiting a stress response to intrauterine needling. Intrauterine
      transfusions are most commonly performed by inserting a needle either in the umbilical cord
      root at the placental surface, or in the intrahepatic portion of the umbilical vein of the
      fetus. Recently, intrauterine needling in the intrahepatic vein has been shown to result in
      alterations in fetal stress hormones, which has been interpreted as a reaction to pain. These
      changes were not observed in intrauterine needling in the umbilical cord root, or after
      administration of analgesics to the fetus. The investigators tested the hypothesis that
      remifentanil provides fetal analgesia, assessed by a reduced fetal stress response. The
      investigators performed a randomised controlled trial comparing fetal stress response between
      patients undergoing intrauterine transfusions for alloimmune fetal anemia receiving
      remifentanil, or placebo.

      Methods: All patients who were diagnosed with a first episode of sigmoid diverticulitis will
      be evaluated for inclusion in the study, pending informed consent. Those patients who have
      evidence of complicated diverticulitis (fistula, abscess) will receive a recommendation to
      undergo elective sigmoid resection, while those who have a simple attack will be recruited in
      the cohort. Follow-up will be performed at yearly intervals through telephone interview with

NCT01010230,Vibration Intervention For Bone Enhancement In Childhood Cancer Survivors,"
      Treatment for childhood cancer interferes with normal bone maturation such that maximal peak
      bone mass may never be attained by some survivors of childhood cancer. In childhood cancer
      survivors, a randomized trial evaluating the effectiveness of vitamin D and calcium
      supplementation among ALL survivors is currently underway; however, few other interventions
      have been offered for this at risk population. Recent evidence demonstrates that low

      perhaps providing an alternative or adjunct to pharmacologic intervention in populations
      where additional medications are either contraindicated or not acceptable to the individuals

NCT01011829,Varenicline vs Placebo for the Treatment of Methamphetamine Dependence,"
      Methamphetamine (MA) abuse is the fastest growing drug problem in the United States and is
      responsible for significant public health complications, including HIV infection. As a result
      effective treatments for MA dependence are urgently needed. There are currently no
      efficacious medications for MA dependence, although results from preliminary randomized
      trials of bupropion for MA dependence found bupropion to be more effective than placebo, but
      only among subgroups of participants, including those with lower frequency of MA use at
      baseline. A growing body of preclinical and clinical studies suggest that cholinergic
      mechanisms play an important role in the neurobiology of MA and other stimulant dependence,
      such as nicotine dependence. Mechanistically, cholinergic medications may alleviate
      MA-associated cognitive dysfunction, thereby improving outcomes of treatment for MA
      dependence. Varenicline is a partial agonist at α4β2 nicotinic receptors and a full agonist
      at α7 nicotinic receptors that has been approved as an anti-cigarette smoking medication. In
      order to assess the potential efficacy of varenicline for methamphetamine dependence, we will
      perform a clinical trial to assess if varenicline compared to placebo results in greater:

      The investigators will use an intradermal capsaicin injection in the forearm to induce a
      state of localized pain. This localized pain will be measured by different means, and
      analysed locally and distally by so called quantitative sensory testing. The primary endpoint
      of measure is the difference in pain perception with and without
      benzodiazepines/GABA-Agonists around the injection point of capsaicin. The secondary
      endpoints are to measure pain modulation locally and distally by different quantitative tests
      as electricity, pressure pain thresholds, and ice water tests.

      The investigators' hypothesis is that clobazam induces higher pain thresholds as placebo and

NCT01014130,Hypofractionated Radiotherapy (Stereotactic) Versus Conventional Radiotherapy for Inoperable Early Stage I Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC),"
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether radiotherapy given as three large doses
      over a period of two weeks (hypofractionated radiotherapy) is more effective than standard
      radiotherapy for patients with non-small cell lung cancer that has not spread beyond the
      lung. Although surgery is the most effective treatment for early lung cancer, many patients
      are not fit enough for an operation. The alternative treatment to surgery is standard
      radiotherapy which is normally 'fractionated' that is, given as a number of small doses over
      a period of weeks. Experience has shown that many small treatments are safer than using a few
      large doses (hypofractionation) because there is less risk of damage to normal tissues.

      Recent advances in technology have however resulted in greater accuracy and with it a
      reduction in the amount of normal tissue affected by the radiation, so the risks of
      hypo-fractionation damaging normal tissue are of less concern. Initial results obtained with
      hypo-fractionated radiotherapy for early stage non-small cell lung cancer indicate that it
      may be more effective in controlling the cancer. However, it has never been compared directly
      with standard fractionation in a randomised trial, so this study aims to determine if
      hypo-fractionation is more effective, results in longer life expectancy and if it is just as
      safe as standard fractionation.

NCT01014182,Early Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) After Fibrinolysis Versus Standard Therapy in ST Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) Patients,"
      Several recent trials (1,2) suggest that all STEMI patients receiving fibrinolysis in non-PCI
      centres should be routinely transferred for elective early PCI within 24 hours from
      hospitalization, with no additive risk of major bleeding complications or other severe
      adverse events compared standard therapy. These results in favour of a routine invasive
      strategy in STEMI patients suggest a potential change to the current approach of awaiting the
      response to treatment in patients receiving fibrinolysis, and draw the attention to the
      potential need for an appropriate network organization with adequate first hospitalization
      treatment (spoke) and prompt transfer to centres with 24/7 PCI capabilities (hub). The recent
      ESC (3) and ACC (4) guidelines on STEMI are consistent with the early ESC PCI Guidelines,
      recommending that angioplasty after fibrinolysis should be performed within a time-window
      ranging between 3 and 24 hours after successful lytic administration (level evidence IIA).
      The reason for the weighting of the recommendation is due to the heterogeneity of trial
      results with different planned-revascularization strategies, variable primary end-points
      definitions, and small individual trial sample sizes. Therefore, a consistent analysis of
      single patient dataset from all published randomized trials would be of value to better
      define the magnitude and duration of clinical benefit of the routine invasive strategy after
      lytic treatment as well as the potential optimal timing of such a strategy.

      The main aim of the OTTER meta-analysis is to define the benefits of immediate PCI after
      fibrinolysis for STEMI patients. Moreover, the OTTER meta-analysis will investigate the
      optimal timing of post-fibrinolysis elective revascularization.

NCT01012557,H1N1v Vaccination of Pregnant Women: A Longitudinal Cohort Study Characterizing Influenza A H1N1v Vaccination in Pregnant Women,"
      Pregnant women are at particular risk during the imminent H1N1v influenza pandemic. The new
      H1N1v virus requires urgent political and medical decisions on vaccination strategies in
      order to minimize severe disease and death from this pandemic. However, there is a lack of
      evidence to build such decisions upon. A vaccine will be provided in the fourth quarter of
      2009, but there is little knowledge on the immunogenicity. Particularly its clinical
      effectiveness and duration of immunity in pregnant women and their newborn infants is
      unknown. Therefore, it will be important to study the optimal vaccination regimens with
      respect to dosing and use of adjuvant to decide future health policies on vaccination of
      pregnant women. We have a unique possibility to study these aspects of H1N1v infection in
      pregnant women in our ongoing unselected, prospective, birth-cohort study recruiting 800
      pregnant mothers between Q1- 2009 and Q4-2010. Pregnant women from East-Denmark are being
      enrolled during the 2nd trimester and their infant will undergo a close clinical follow-up.
      The H1N1v pandemic is expected to reach Denmark Q4-2009. The timing of this enrollment and
      the imminent pandemic allows for an ""experiment of nature"" whereby the first half of the
      mothers completes pregnancy before the H1N1v pandemic. The other half of this cohort will be
      pregnant while H1N1v is prevalent in the community and will require H1N1v vaccination. The
      aim of this randomized, controlled, trial is to compare and evaluate the dose-related immune
      protection conferred by vaccine and adjuvant (Novartis vaccine Focetria) in pregnant women
      and non-pregnant women. In addition the protocol will assess the passive immunity conferred
      to the newborn from these vaccine regimes. The study will provide evidence-based guidance for
      health policies on vaccination for the population of pregnant women during future H1N1v
      pandemics.

      To the investigators' knowledge, no randomized controlled trial has evaluated this.

      The investigators therefore perform a randomized controlled trial including 76 patients with
      type 2 diabetes to investigate this.

      The investigators' hypothesis is that:

      This is a 12-week, open-label, pilot trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of the
      combination of Clobex® spray with excimer laser therapy as the initial treatment of
      generalized plaque psoriasis, followed by maintenance therapy with topical Vectical. The
      study will be conducted in three distinct periods, namely Period A, Period B, and Period C,
      each of 4 weeks duration. During Period A (weeks 1 through 4), patients will use Clobex®
      spray twice daily along with excimer laser treatments twice weekly with the Photomedex XTRAC®
      Velocity machine. The goal of Period A is to achieve Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) 75
      in 100% of patients within four weeks. During Period B (weeks 5 through 8), patients would be
      treated with topical Vectical® twice daily. Thus, there is a steroid-free interval during
      which patients will not be using Clobex® spray. The goal of Period B is to maintain the
      patient's response using only non-steroid options. During Period C of the study, patients
      will use Clobex® spray BID and Vectical® BID. Period C (weeks 9 through 12) will be a

      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by muscle rigidity,
      tremor, a slowing of physical movement (bradykinesia) and, in extreme cases, a loss of
      physical movement. The primary symptoms are the results of decreased stimulation of the motor
      cortex arising from the basal ganglia normally caused by the insufficient formation and
      action of dopamine, which is produced in the dopaminergic neurons of the brain. Secondary
      symptoms may include high level cognitive dysfunction and subtle language problems. Included
      in the symptomatology experienced by patients with PD, visual abnormalities are not uncommon.
      Visual changes among patients with PD appear not only dynamic in nature, but differentially
      affected based on the course of the disease and, perhaps more importantly, its treatment.
      Parkinson's disease has significant ramifications not only in observation of irregularities
      in vision, but how vision interacts with entrainment of the circadian clock. The purpose of
      this study is to examine the relationship between PD and operation of a unique set of retinal

      Treatment of chronic pain is a major clinical challenge since chronic pain is frequent and
      leads to deterioration of quality of life. An injury or wound can lead to long term changes
      in the nervous system that make the skin more sensitive at and near the injury; this is
      termed hyperalgesia and occurs through long term depotentiation (LTP), i.e., a change in the
      synaptic interaction between neurons.

      Opioids are the gold standard for the symptomatic therapy of moderate to severe pain. Now, in
      animal studies the investigators have discovered previously unrecognized effects of opioids.

      UV-B irradaition of the skin of the thigh is an established model of priamary and secondary
      hyperalgeisa in humans. The investigators want to test the influence of remifentanil, an

NCT01017432,Compliance Of Medication After Discharge From the Hospital in the Elderly,"
      Many elderly patients have multiple medications and variable dosing regimens and the ability
      for hospitals to properly reconcile medications between what is given on paper to the patient
      and what the patients take at home depends on the patient's ability to get the medications.
      Some patients may delay in getting their medications from the pharmacy after being
      discharged. For some it may be a lack of transportation, others may feel too ill to travel
      and may not have family members who will be able to pick up the medications.

      It is for these reasons the authors of this study want to inventory the medications that an
      elderly patient is being discharged on during a home visit and check on the actual
      prescriptions that a patient has at their house the following 1-2 days after discharge.

NCT01015209,Safety and Tolerability of Chitosan-N-acetylcysteine Eye Drops in Healthy Young Volunteers,"
      The ""dry eye syndrome"" DES is a highly prevalent ocular disease, in particular in the elderly
      population. One mainstay of therapy for patients suffering from DES is the use of topically
      administered lubricants. However, despite many efforts, no ""ideal"" formulation has yet been
      found.

      Recently, Croma Pharma has introduced chitosan-N-acetylcysteine eye drops, designed for
      treatment of symptoms related to DES. Chemically, chitosan is a polycationic biopolymer with
      favourable biological properties such as high biocompatibility and low toxicity.
      Additionally, the new formulation comprises N-acetylcysteine, which has been used in
      ophthalmology because of its mucolytic properties for several years. Based on theoretical
      considerations, one can hypothesize that the new chitosan derivative may show an increased
      adhesion to mucins of the ocular surface and may therefore be particularly beneficial in
      reducing the symptoms associated with DES.

NCT01010607,Use of Tendon Vibration and Mirror for the Improvement of Upper Limb Function and Pain Reduction,"
      Upper limb paralysis following stroke is a very common problem. Only 30% of stroke patients
      who suffer from upper limb paresis experience a full recovery of function. There is a need
      for the development of more efficient rehabilitation methods for the improvement of the
      paralysed upper limb function.

      It has been shown that the use of mirror therapy after a stroke induces the activation of
      motor, sensory and associative regions in the affected hemisphere and is associated with an
      improvement in the function of the affected limb. Mirror therapy is a treatment modality in
      which the affected arm is hidden from the patient's sight; the patient is instructed to watch
      the reflection of his healthy hand on a mirror while he performs movements with his healthy
      hand and tries to move simultaneously his affected hand. This induces the illusion that his
      affected hand moves well.

      It has also been shown that applying vibration to a muscle tendon at frequencies between
      50-100 Hz induces an illusion of elongation of the vibrated muscle, if visual feedback is
      prevented. For instance, vibrating the triceps will induce a strong illusion of elbow
      flexion.

      In the present study the investigators will couple the use of a mirror with the application
      of vibration to tendons, in order to obtain a multisensorial and strong illusion of movement
      in the paralyzed limb.

      The study hypothesis is that the administration of mirror therapy together with vibration
      will induce the activation of multiple motor, sensory and associative areas in the affected
      brain hemisphere, resulting in improvement of the affected upper limb function, compared to
      the administration of mirror therapy alone or sham therapy.

NCT01019239,LapLAND Laparoscopic Lavage for Acute Non-Faeculant Diverticulitis,"
      The aim of the study is to compare patient outcome following standard of care (Hartmann's or
      resection with anastomosis and defunctioning stoma) and a 'new therapy' (laparoscopic lavage
      alone) for the treatment of acute perforated non-faeculant diverticulitis in Irish hospitals.

      Perforated diverticulitis requires emergency surgery. This carries significant risks and
      mortality as high as 15% during the index admission has been reported. Our group has
      established the safety of laparoscopic lavage alone on the largest cohort to date in a
      prospective multi-institutional study of 100 patients, providing convincing evidence that
      laparoscopic lavage alone is a reasonable alternative to resection for non-faeculant
      perforated diverticulitis. Our aim now is to translate this well-established study design
      into a protocol for a multi-institutional randomised control trial as direct comparison is
      the only way to provide convincing evidence of one modality over another.

      All patients will be followed up for twelve months and primary (operative and in-hospital
      mortality) and secondary (in-hospital and post-discharge morbidity; rates of stoma formation;
      rates of re-presentation with diverticulitis with or without perforation.) end-points will be
      recorded.

      Sample size calculations reveal that a patient cohort of 100 in each arm will be sufficient
      to detect a difference in morbidity and mortality between groups The ratio between Hinchey 3
      and Hinchey 4 is estimated to be approximately 2:1. In order to guarantee sufficient sample
      size, therefore, 300 patients must fulfil the study criteria allowing for exclusion of 100 at

      The ADOPT study is a prospective, nested case-controlled and open label clinical trial. About
      40 centers across China participate in this study with a planned 800 Chinese cases
      enrollment. All patients will receive optimal medical treatment. Patients who have successful
      CRT-P/D implant will be assigned to CRT group. According to the baseline evaluation, matched
      cases will be selected from the enrolled OPT(optimal medical treatment) alone group (Group
      for Selection). After successful match, the cases in Group for Selection enters into
      follow-up and become control group. The unmatched cases in the Group for Selection will be
      removed. If patients agree, after re-evaluation of the baseline situation, she or he may
      enter into Group for Selection again. Since patients know she/he already have a device
      implant and the examiners are aware of the grouping of the patients after seeing the incision
      scar and post-implant electrocardiogram, this study is open-label designed, however the
      executive committee will be kept blind when making event-adjudication. Prospectively defined

NCT01011621,Efficacy and Tolerability of Prednisolone Acetate 0.5% Cream Versus Betamethasone Valerate 0.1% Cream in Cortisosensitive Dermatosis,"
      Topical corticosteroids are largely used in dermatology. The major problem related to their
      use is that the same mechanisms underlying their therapeutic effects (antiinflammatory and
      antiproliferative) may lead to adverse events. Conditions sensitive to corticosteroids
      require formulations with mild to moderate potency while high-potency corticosteroids era
      required in less responsive conditions. The aim of the present study is to compare the safety
      and efficacy of prednisolone acetate 0.5% cream (mild-potency non-fluoridated corticosteroid)
      versus betamethasone valerate 0.1% cream (high-potency fluoridated corticosteroid) in the
      treatment of mild to moderate cortisosensitive dermatosis (atopic dermatitis, contact
      dermatitis, seborrheic dermatitis and psoriasis). The study hypothesis is that 0.5%
      prednisolone cream will be as effective as 0.1% betamethasone cream and will be an
      alternative option to treat corticosensitive dermatosis in body areas where the use of
      fluoridated corticosteroids is contraindicated, such as the face.

NCT01010698,Class 3 Biowaivers,"
      The Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS) is employed by the US FDA to categorize drug
      substances into 4 classes and to characterize drugs in terms of aqueous solubility and
      intestinal permeability. The four BCS categories for a drug substance are Class 1, Class 2,
      Class 3, and Class 4. Biopharmaceutical properties of aqueous solubility and intestinal
      permeability with drug product dissolution determine the rate and extent of drug absorption
      from immediate-release (IR) and solid oral dosages forms (e.g. tablets,capsules). Each class
      exhibits information regarding biopharmaceutic properties and bioequivalence. For example,
      Class 1 drugs have the most favorable oral biopharmaceutic properties (high solubility and
      high permeability). With these biopharmaceutic properties for class 1 drugs, results in vivo
      bioequivalence (BE) studies for rapidly dissolving IR solid oral dosage forms the FDA
      provided waivers. This approach alone has resulted in new and generic drugs approved based on
      vitro data alone (i.e. biowaived), with great savings in resources and reduction in
      unnecessary human testing.

      Objectives: 1) The primary objective of this study is to assess whether common excipients
      cause bioinequivalence of Class 3 drugs. 2) The secondary objective is the results of the
      study will contribute towards providing scientific evidence to the FDA for consideration of
      Class 3 drugs for BCS-based biowaivers.

      Hypotheses: The investigators anticipate that common excipients do not cause
      bioinequivalence. 1) Hence, the hypothesize of this study is commonly used excipients in oral
      medications (tablets, capsules) modulate the rate or extent of Class 3 drug absorption and
      result in bioinequivalence. 2) Alternative hypothesis is that commonly used excipients in
      oral medications (tablets, capsules) do not modulate the rate or extent of Class 3 drug
      absorption and do not result in bioinequivalence.

      motion sickness, non-smoking status, female gender, planned opiate use for post-operative
      analgesia were identified in white people. Whereas, risk factors for PONV in female patient
      with mongolian race were not clear. As a different life style and genetic background, new
      risk factors may associate with PONV in this population. The present study is a prospective
      cohort study to identify risk factors for PONV within 24 postoperative hours in chinese
      female patients underwent gynecology operative under general anesthesia.

NCT01020318,Evaluation of Outcome Measures for Patients Diagnosed With Traumatic Brain Injury,"
      Background:

        -  Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant injury in the Armed Forces, but it is also
           common in the general population. This condition poses significant challenges for both
           diagnosis and therapy. However, the biological and neurological reasons for TBI remain
           poorly understood and are in need of more in-depth study.

        -  The National Institutes of Health is collaborating with several military medical centers
           and research units in a multi-year study of TBI in civilian and military patients. In
           anticipation of these research projects, the Clinical Center s Rehabilitation Medicine
           Department needs to become familiar with the instruments they will likely need to
           evaluate this group of subjects.

      Objectives:

        -  To evaluate potential test instruments in patients with TBI.

        -  To evaluate patient tolerance of an extensive battery of assessments and the time
           required to complete the assessments.

        -  To improve staff competencies on new or novel assessments of the TBI patient population

      Eligibility:

        -  Individuals 18 years of age and older who have been diagnosed with a traumatic brain
           injury in the past 5 years.

        -  Healthy volunteers 18 years of age and older who have had no instances of significant
           head trauma.

      Design:

        -  This study requires approximately 3 days of outpatient or inpatient evaluation.

        -  Subjects will undergo cognitive and neuropsychological tests, physical assessments,
           speech and language evaluation, and balance testing. Tests will be given orally, in
           writing, and on computers. The testing will be done in blocks of 2 to 3 hours, with rest
           periods as needed.

        -  Subjects may undergo any or all of the following assessments and screening tools, as
           determined by the researchers:

        -  Cognitive, quality of life, and functional assessments

        -  Speech, language, and swallowing assessments

        -  Physical functional performance and environment assessments (including balance testing)

      A randomised controlled trial will be performed to evaluate the effects of lung volume
      reduction surgery (LVRS) in patients with COPD on systemic inflammation, oxidative stress,
      endothelial function, arterial stiffness and blood pressure. We hypothesize that LVRS will
      lead to a reduction of systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, arterial stiffness and blood
      pressure and to improved endothelial function.

      For this purpose 30 patients with severe/very severe COPD (GOLD III-IV) and pulmonary
      emphysema who are to undergo LVRS will be randomised to one of two groups: group 1 receiving
      immediate LVRS and group 2 receiving LVRS after a delay of 3 months.

      Measures of systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, endothelial function, arterial stiffness
      and blood pressure will be measured at baseline and 3 months after surgery and no surgery,
      respectively (group 2 receiving surgery only after a delay of 3 months will serve as control
      group) to investigate the effects of LVRS on the described outcomes.

      during weaning from ventilator and investigated whether weaning could be better done without
      a spontaneous breathing trial in non-COPD（COPD, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease）
      critically ill patients. This study has revealed, for the first time, that compared with use
      of SBT in discontinuing ventilator process, patients underwent successful extubation without
      SBT. For this subset of patients the findings suggest that SBT may be excluded preceding
      extubation in a general intensive care population.

NCT01024439,Transumbilical Single Incision Versus Conventional Three Incisions Laparoscopic Appendicectomy,"
      Laparoscopic appendicectomy is widely practiced in Hong Kong nowadays with shorter hospital
      stay and less wound complications. Most of the time, three small wounds of less than 10mm
      will be adequate enough for the completion of the surgery with minimal pain.

      Recently, the concept of Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery (N.O.T.E.S) led to
      the attention of single incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) again in the surgical community.
      SILS is not a new idea. The first SILS for cholecystectomy was reported in 1997 by Navarra et
      al. However, the close proximity of the instruments, limitation in triangulation during
      dissection and suboptimal exposure of the surgical field has made this approach unpopular in
      last decade. Because the concept of N.O.T.E.S and the newly designed access port, surgeons
      are now focused again on SILS. The Chinese University of Hong Kong has recently release their
      preliminary results on the use of SILS on appendicectomy with satisfactory results in terms
      of less post-operative pain and less prominent scar. However, it was a case series with
      limited number of patients. In order to test the advantages of SILS on the management of

      RATIONALE: Stereotactic body radiation therapy may be able to send x-rays directly to the
      tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine
      hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing
      the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving stereotactic body radiation therapy
      together with gemcitabine hydrochloride may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects of stereotactic body radiation
      therapy when given with or without gemcitabine hydrochloride in treating patients with
      pancreatic cancer that can be removed by surgery.

NCT01026129,Efficacy of Remifentanil Compared to Lidocaine on the Incidence of Coughing During Emergence of Anesthesia,"
      This study is designed to compare the effects of a bolus dose of remifentanil to a bolus dose
      of lidocaine given prior to the emergence of anesthesia:

        -  on the incidence of perioperative coughing

        -  on the time needed for the emergence of a desflurane-based anesthesia

        -  on the incidence of sore throat after extubation.

      Our hypothesis is that the use of a remifentanil bolus dose given prior to emergence of a
      desflurane-based anesthesia will reduce the incidence of perioperative coughing from 70% to
      35% compared to lidocaine.

      Mometasone furoate (MF) is a synthetic glucocorticosteroid that, when administered to asthma
      patients with a dry powder inhaler (Asmanex® Twisthaler®) at dosages of 100 to 400 mcg twice
      daily, has been shown to improve lung function, reduce symptoms of asthma, and reduce
      frequency and severity of exacerbations by reducing airway inflammation, with a relatively
      low potential to cause systemic side effects such as hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)

NCT01027247,OculusGen™ Collagen Matrix Implant for Phaco-Trabeculectomy in Primary Glaucoma: a Case-Control Study,"
      Frequently glaucoma is not controlled with clinical treatment (""eyedrops"") or laser surgery
      to control your eye pressure. If this raised pressure is sustained over a long period of time
      it can lead to permanent damage to the optic nerve (glaucoma) and in severe cases it can
      result in blindness. You also have cataracts, an opacification of the natural lens inside the
      eye that is impairing your vision. To prevent further vision loss due to glaucoma, your
      doctor has recommended glaucoma filtration surgery to lower your eye pressure, and cataract
      surgery at the same time to improve your sight.

      The use of the anti-metabolite (Mitomycin-C) during the operation is currently the drug of
      choice to improve surgical outcome for glaucoma filtration surgery. Mitomycin-C is a potent
      antiscarring agent that reduces the amount of scar tissue produced after surgery which leads
      to better control of eye pressure. Although this potent drug is effective in increasing
      surgical success, its use is related to a higher risk of post surgical complications, some of
      which are sight threatening.

      The Collagen Matrix Implant is a biodegradable implant (absorbed naturally by tissue), made
      from porcine collagen, which reduces scar tissue formed after glaucoma filtration surgery
      without the use of Mitomycin-C. This means that you could be less likely to have a failed
      glaucoma filtration surgery, and consequently, a poor eye pressure control. In addition, the
      risk of surgical failure may be reduced because with this technique, we will not be using
      potent drugs. However, the long-term effect of the OculusGenTm implant in glaucoma filtration
      surgery is not fully known.

      The aim of the study is to determine whether the OculusGenTm implant can equal the success
      rate of Mitomycin-C in controlling eye pressure, without the potentially sight threatening
      complications associated with Mitomycin use. And at the same time, this study aim to
      determine if the implant can reduce potential complications related to glaucoma surgery when
      compared to the combined surgery augmented with anti-proliferative agents.

NCT01027442,"The Use of Bone-, Tooth- and Mucosa- Supported Stereolithographic Guides for Dental Implant Placement","
      Introduction:

      The use stereolithographic (SLA) guides may provide significant benefits in simultaneous
      placement of multiple implants, especially in large edentulous areas lacking anatomic
      landmarks for surgical reference. Planning of the implant positions prior to surgery may
      shorten the duration of the surgery spent by exploring and determining the suitable implant
      location on the edentulous alveolar crest in the standard technique . Previous studies have
      demonstrated the use of many SLA guide in this manner, however; most were designed to be used
      as placed on the alveolar crest (bone-supported) following a flap exposure, and there was no
      depth-control of the osteotomy drills. Further advances in stereolithography allowed flapless
      surgeries to be performed via mucosa-supported guides (Rosenfeld, et al. 2006c, Tardieu, et
      al. 2007). The use of these guides eliminates not only the time required for incision and
      flap exposure but post-operative patient morbidity and discomfort may also be reduced, due to
      the non-invasive nature of the procedure. The aim of this study is to investigate the
      accuracy, surgical and post-operative complications and post-loading outcomes of implants
      placed by the conventional and aforementioned computer-aided methods.

NCT01028430,B Cell Repertoires in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia and Aging,"
      B-CLL is the most prevalent leukemia in the Western hemisphere, accounting for ~25% of all
      leukemia's (1). This disease occurs virtually exclusively in the aging population, with the
      median age of diagnosis ranging between the mid 60s and the early 70s. Indeed, its occurrence
      before the age of 50 is quite unusual. This increase in occurrence with age is not unique to
      B-CLL; rather, it is characteristic several B cell lymphoproliferative disorders (e.g.,
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, multiple myeloma). Gender and race also influence the development of
      B-CLL. Thus, the ratio of men: women is ~2:1 and the prevalence is increased in Caucasians.
      The rate of occurrence of B-CLL among Asians is significantly lower than for Caucasians and
      this does not increase with immigration to the West. DNA sequence analyses performed in our
      laboratory and in those of others indicate that B-CLL cells from unrelated patients share Ig
      V gene characteristics. These include the use of selected genes, the association of these
      genes with certain D and JH gene segments that code for unique CDR3 motifs, and the
      occasional occurrence of highly similar VHDJH + VLJL pairs. In ~50% cases, these rearranged
      genes are mutated, whereas in the others mutations are infrequent; this difference is related
      to the VH gene family used by the B-CLL cell.

NCT01028482,Treatment of Postpartum Depression With Psychotherapy and Add-on Sertraline,"
      Introduction:

      Postpartum depression (PPD) occurs in large numbers of women (between 10 - 20%) and
      substantially affects both their own well-being and their offspring's mental and emotional
      development. Whereas PPD is a form of major depression, its etiology is probably related to a
      combination of biological (hereditary, hormonal etc.), and psychological factors. In
      practice, most women suffering from PPD do not seek treatment, or are treated with
      psychotherapy alone due to concerns regarding pharmacotherapy. This is despite the obvious
      importance of reaching a rapid remission in these women. In fact, data regarding the
      treatment of PPD with antidepressants is surprisingly sparse and is limited to only one
      blinded and placebo-controlled study (with fluoxetine) and a number of studies without a
      placebo arm . The reason for the paucity of double-blinded placebo-controlled studies is
      probably due to 3 main limiting factors: Firstly, the reluctance of women to ""admit"" to and
      seek professional help due to depression, Secondly, the difficulty to administer
      antidepressant medication to lactating women, and, Thirdly, the ethical difficulties in
      designing a study with a real placebo group.

      In contrast to the very limited number of drug studies in this population, there are a number
      of studies that have shown the efficacy of psychotherapy in the treatment of PPD. Positive
      studies have been published using different types of psychotherapy, including cognitive,
      dynamic and interpersonal psychotherapy.

      The investigators propose to study the efficacy of psychotherapeutic treatment in women
      suffering from PPD with add-on sertraline in a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled
      design. To overcome the difficulties described above in studying antidepressants in the
      postpartum period, the investigators propose to include active brief dynamic psychotherapy
      for all women. Furthermore, the investigators will selectively allow inclusion of women who
      only suffer from either mild or moderate major PPD (not severe / suicidal) .

      Hypothesis:

      The investigators hypothesize that women with PPD randomized to the arm receiving
      psychotherapy + active sertraline will show a greater response rate than the psychotherapy +
      placebo group. Furthermore, the investigators hypothesize that the difference in response
      between the 2 groups will demonstrate a significant early response in the active sertraline
      group.

      Parkinson's disease is a major neurodegenerative disorder in which there is a progressive
      loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. The understanding that PD is a syndrome of

NCT01028989,A Reduced Carbohydrate Diet Intervention for Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS),"
      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects 5-10% of women of reproductive age, and is
      associated with infertility, risk for obesity and type 2 diabetes, and impaired quality of
      life. The elevated insulin characteristic of PCOS is likely to play a major role in its
      symptoms. Manipulation of dietary carbohydrate quantity and quality (glycemic load; GL) may
      lower insulin and improve both reproductive and metabolic outcomes. The purpose of this study
      is to determine if a lower GL diet intervention is more effective than a standard (STD) diet
      in improving reproductive and metabolic outcomes of women with PCOS in the absence of weight
      loss.

NCT01029301,Evaluation of Safety and Efficacy of Using EndyMed Pro Skin Treatment System for Skin Wrinkle Treatment on Body Areas,"
      Skin aging is a multifactorial process involving the 3 layers of the skin: Epidermis, dermis
      and hypodermis. Skin aging process involves among others: skin roughness (epidermis), skin
      dyschromia (epidermis, dermis), wrinkles and elastosis - skin texture changes due to collagen
      modification, skin laxity and cellulite (dermis and hypodermis).

      EndyMed has developed the EndyMed Pro system - Computerized Radiofrequency System for Skin
      Tightening. By using a multielectrodes treatment tip an exact computerized thermal pattern
      can be produced allowing to selectively heating one or more of the target tissues (epidermis,
      dermis and hypodermis). In the skin tightening module the dermis and hypodermis would be
      targeted, creating enough thermal effect to induce collagen remodeling with no ablative
      thermal damage in the epidermis or dermis. This post marketing study is intended for
      evaluation of safety and efficacy of the EndyMed Pro system.

NCT01021930,Comparison of Diabetes Mellitus and Non-diabetes Mellitus Patients for DES Surface COVERage by OCT,"
      Diabetic patients are prone to a diffuse and rapidly progressive form of atherosclerosis.
      Both clinical and angiographic outcomes following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)
      are poor in patients with DM compared with those without DM. Autopsy study has shown delayed
      neointimal healing with inadequate endothelialization and persistent stent surface ﬁbrin
      deposition after DES implantation in DM patients. This might partially contribute to the high
      risk of late stent thrombosis.

      YINYI Polymer-Free paclitaxel stent is a domestic new type stent with bare metal base with
      micro porous surface. However, limited data is available in vivo about the surface coverage
      after stent implantation in DM patients because of lack of sensitive imaging modalities.
      Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an optical analogue of intravascular
      ultrasound（IVUS）that allows high-resolution tomographic intravascular imaging. Furthermore,
      several studies have demonstrated the feasibility of OCT to quantitatively evaluate the
      surface coverage and stent conditions in the follow up after PCI .

      Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze the surface coverage and late malapposition
      after two types of DES implantation in DM patients compared with non-DM patients by using OCT
      and IVUS.

      Elevated body temperature after cardiac arrest is associated with a worse outcome. Previous
      trials did not treat elevated body temperature in the control groups. The optimal target
      temperature for post-resuscitation care is not known. The primary purpose with the TTM-trial

NCT01020188,Study of Global Coagulation Tests in Patients With Paroxysmal Nocturnal Haemoglobinuria,"
      Paroxysmal nocturnal haemaoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare disease which results in breakdown of
      the red blood cells and bone marrow failure. It is associated with an increased risk of blood
      clots. Until recently, treatment has been with blood transfusions and in patients with a
      blood clot, blood thinners. A new treatment called eculizumab is now standard for patients
      who require regular blood transfusions. It works in the majority of patients by preventing
      the breakdown of red blood cells. This can eliminate the need for blood transfusion and
      reduce the risk of blood clots. It is not well understood why patients with PNH are at high
      risk of blood clots. The investigators plan to use specialised blood tests to assess the
      stickiness of the blood before starting eculizumab treatment and monthly after starting
      treatment. The investigators will compare these tests with standard tests of clotting.

NCT01022697,Evaluation of the Benefits of Glucose Drinks During Childbirth,"
      Fear of full stomach when emergency general anaesthesia is required is the origin of
      fastening when giving birth. This behaviour does not warranty perfect security for the
      general anaesthesia. In addition, well being for women and new born is affected. Giving birth
      is finally compared to a sportive competition with high-energy needs. As Intravenous energy
      intake is not regulated by physiologic digestion, it can induce metabolic disorders for the
      mother that can be amplified for the foetus.

      Oral glucose drinks could offer some benefits:

        -  gastric acidity would be decreased without significant increase in volumes.

        -  energy intake would further more active and more efficiency labour

        -  an increase in foetus well being

      However, it has never been shown yet that such behaviour could offer those benefits. Also, it
      seems that there is not more vomiting, but most of the studies compared oral glucose intake
      to waterborne intake with the same volumes The expected efficacy is a reduction in labour
      duration and a reduction in percentage of extraction. Previous studies said that the lack of
      statistical power due to small number of subjects caused the absence of statistical
      significant relationship.

      In addition, even though newborn have less acidosis, there is no clinical relationship
      proven.

      The investigators propose a randomised multicentre study to assess efficacy of oral glucose
      drinks in comparison to traditional fastening when giving birth.

      Fenofibrate is one of the best options for treating hypertriglyceridemia. In the majority of

      LDL-cholesterol. However, the response to fenofibrate is highly variable and currently there
      are no screening tests to identify poor responders. Genetic and environmental factors may
      explain the high variability in response. Although exploratory in nature, this study is of
      clinical and public health importance because prediction of drug response among those with
      hypertriglyceridemia is clinically challenging and fenofibrate prescription costs are large
      ($90 to $130/patient/month); targeting the responsive patients at the outset will help
      improve treatment outcomes at a lower cost. If successful, the investigators will propose to

      Auditory Neuropathy / Auditory Dys-synchrony (AN/AD). Goal: The goal of the research was to
      evaluate the auditory performance and the characteristics of the electrically evoked compound
      action potential (ECAP) in a group of 18 cochlear implants recipients with AN/AD.The auditory
      perception was evaluated by sound field thresholds and speech perception tests. To evaluate
      ECAP's characteristics, the threshold and amplitude of neural response together with the
      amplitude growth and recovery functions were evaluated at 80Hz stimulation rate.The CI was
      seen as an efficient resource to develop auditory skills in 94% of the AN/AD patients
      considered by the research. The auditory perception benefits as well as the possibility to
      measure the ECAP showed that the electrical stimulation could compensate the neural
      dys-synchrony caused by the AN/AD. However, a unique clinical procedure cannot be proposed at

      PURPOSE: To affirm the effectiveness and complication rate of postoperative single-dose
      beta-irradiation (RT) with (90) Sr in the case of primary pterygium in a clinical trial.
      METHODS AND MATERIALS: This trial was designed as a prospective, randomized, single center
      study. Surgery was performed in all cases according to the conjunctival autograft technique.
      One thousand and four patients with 108 pterygia were postoperatively randomized to either
      beta-RT or observation. In the case of beta-RT, a (90) Sr eye applicator was used to deliver
      1000 cGy to the sclera surface at a dose rate of between 200 and 250 cGy/min. After
      treatment, both an ophthalmologist and a radiation oncologist performed the follow-up
      examinations. The accumulated data were analyzed using a group sequential test. RESULTS:
      Between February 2007 and September 2008, 104 eyes with primary pterygium were operated on
      according to the trial protocol. Additional treatment was performed within 24 hours
      postoperatively. Four patients were lost to follow-up, resulting in 104 patients who could be
      analyzed. In the 54 eyes randomized to receive beta-RT, 5 relapses occurred compared with 8
      recurrences in the 50 eyes that no received RT, for a crude control rate of 90.7 % vs. 84 %,
      respectively. At a mean follow-up of 9 months (range 4- 18), major treatment complications
      had not been observed . CONCLUSION: Single-dose beta-RT of 1000cGy after conjunctival
      autograft surgery is a simple, effective, and safe treatment that reduces the risk of primary
      pterygium recurrence.

NCT01024296,Efficacy Study to Evaluate Laparoscopic Fascial Closure Device,"
      During any minimally invasive surgery case, 5-25mm size incisions need to be made to gain
      access to the abdomen. One of the most difficult, time-consuming, and sometimes unreliable
      parts of the case is closing these incisions, especially in obese patients. This is mainly
      because these incisions are very small and the layer that needs to be closed (fascia) rests
      deep underneath the skin and fat tissue of the abdominal wall. Two of the investigators (CM
      and BS) have developed at Stanford an instrument that allows for an easier and more reliable
      closure of these wounds. The purpose of this study is to test this instrument in the closure
      of laparoscopic wounds in obese patients undergoing laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery.

NCT01025193,Desensitization With Belimumab in Sensitized Patients Awaiting Kidney Transplant,"
      If subjects are listed for kidney transplant and are considered sensitized, this means they
      have a high amount of antibodies in their blood that could react to a kidney transplant
      offered for them. Antibodies are protein substances made by the body that fight anything that
      the body considers as a threat to it, such as infection or a kidney transplant. Sensitization
      may be due to prior transplants, pregnancy, or blood transfusions. Being sensitized can
      increase the subject's kidney transplant waiting time as it is more difficult to find a
      suitable kidney transplant for them that their antibodies will not react to. The purpose of
      this research study is to see if giving the investigational drug belimumab up to one year
      pre-transplant can de-sensitize the subjects, or decrease the amount of antibodies in their
      blood. This may help make the subjects eligible to receive a kidney transplant more quickly.
      If after receiving belimumab, the subjects are compatible with a donor kidney offered and are
      medically suitable for transplant at that time, a kidney transplant will be performed.

      This study is an open-label, multicentric, exploratory, single arm, phase II study of adults
      who are either more than 60 years old, or are unfit for intensive chemotherapy and allo SCT.
      The patients are treated with NILOTINIB, administered orally twice daily, for 6 weeks (Course
      A) followed by IMATINIB, administered orally twice daily, for other 6 weeks (Course B).The
      courses will be repeated (rotated) for a total of 4 times or until relapse, or until it is in
      the interest of the patients. Prednisone (P) will be administered to all patients for 7-14
      days, before TKIs, so as to make it possible to wait for the results of cytogenetic and
      molecular tests, and to evaluate the response to P alone, hence for another 21 days.
      Intrathecal therapy (IT) with MTX/AraC/DEX is mandatory, monthly, in patients without
      clinical-cytologic evidence of meningeal involvement, while in patients with CNS involvement
      it is performed twice weekly until clearance of leukemic cells, hence once weekly. IM will be
      administered at the dosage of 600 mg daily (300 mg twice daily) and Nilotinib at the dosage

NCT01025778,Haploidentical Stem Cell Transplantation for Children With Therapy Resistant Leukemia,"
      Despite substantial progress in the treatment pediatric acute leukemia a significant number
      of children will experience primary or secondary resistance to the treatment. In other words
      it will be not possible to achieve remission using standard chemotherapy (primary resistance)
      or the patients will develop chemotherapy resistant relapse (secondary resistance). Children
      failing to achieve remission or children relapsing after previous allogeneic stem cell
      transplantation have short life expectancy and palliative treatment still remains the most
      reasonable option as the escalation of conventional chemotherapy is not longer effective.

      The role of Graft versus Leukemia effect was postulated as one of the mechanisms contributing
      to the leukemia control/eradication after transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells.

      In this study the investigators combine intensified multiagent Clofarabine containing
      chemotherapy with post-induction treatment intensification using reduced intensity
      conditioning followed by haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Introducing
      a new drug to the treatment of resistant leukemia the investigators want to achieve a
      response which allows us to proceed to immediate haploidentical transplantation. Using a
      haploidentical donor the investigators can avoid time consuming search for an unrelated donor
      and perform the transplantation at the optimal time-point. Combating therapy resistant
      leukemia the investigators would like to evoke and utilize potential Graft-versus-Leukemia
      effect which is much more pronounced in the haploidentical setting, as it is well documented
      that allogeneic transplantation with a matched donor is not effective in resistant disease.
      The use of best KIR mismatch donor and post-transplant donor lymphocyte infusion will be
      implemented in order to develop/intensify graft versus leukemia effect.

NCT01025960,A Comparison of Methods to Detect Polyps During Colonoscopy,"
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer and second leading cause of cancer
      deaths in western countries. Colonoscopy is a preferred colorectal screening modality since
      it has both diagnostic and therapeutic capability. Detection and removal of polyps at
      colonoscopy decreases the incidence and mortality from colorectal cancer.

      Typical practice is to insert the colonoscope rapidly until it reaches the cecum (a
      pouch-like portion of the intestines, where the large bowel and the small bowel meet). The
      physician then withdraws the colonoscope slowly and looks for any polyps or abnormalities
      within the large bowel. The purpose of this study is to compare this standard practice to the
      approach whereby the physician examines the bowel as the scope is initially inserted AND as
      the colonoscope is withdrawn from patients' colons.

      This is a Pilot/Phase I, single arm, single center, open label study to determine the safety,
      efficacy and cellular kinetics of CART19 (CTL019) in chemotherapy resistant or refractory
      CD19+ leukemia and lymphoma subjects. The study consists of three Phases:

      1) a Screening Phase, followed by 2) an Intervention/Treatment Phase consisting of apheresis,
      lymphodepleting chemotherapy (determined by the Investigator and based on subject's disease
      burden and histology, as well as on the prior chemotherapy history received), infusions of
      CTL019, tumor collection by bone marrow aspiration or lymph node biopsy (optional, depending
      on availability), and 3) a Follow-up Phase.

      The suitability of subjects' T cells for CTL019 manufacturing was determined at study entry.

      Subjects with adequate T cells were leukapheresed to obtain large numbers of peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells for CTL019 manufacturing. The T cells were purified from the peripheral
      blood mononuclear cells, transduced with TCR-ζ/4-1BB lentiviral vector, expanded in vitro and
      then frozen for future administration. The number of subjects who had inadequate T cell
      collections, expansion or manufacturing compared to the number of subjects who had T cells
      successfully manufactured is a primary measure of feasibility of this study.

      Unless contraindicated and medically not advisable based on previous chemotherapy, subjects
      were given conditioning chemotherapy prior to CTL019 infusion. The chemotherapy was completed
      1 to 4 days before the planned infusion of the first dose of CTL019.

      Up to 20 evaluable subjects with CD19+ leukemia or lymphoma were planned to be dosed with
      CTL019. A single dose of CTL019 (consisting of approximately 5x10^9 total cells, with a
      minimal acceptable dose for infusion of 1.5x10^7 CTL019 cells) was to be given to subjects as
      fractions (10%, 30% and 60% of the total dose) on Day 0, 1 and 2. A second 100% dose of
      CTL019 was initially permitted to be given on Day 11 to 14 to subjects, providing they had
      adequate tolerance to the first dose and sufficient CTL019 was manufactured.

      The overall goal of this proposal is to determine the effects of acute hyperglycemia and its
      modulation by Glucagon-like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) on myocardial perfusion in type 2 diabetes
      (DM). This study plan utilizes myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE) to explore a) the
      effects of acute hyperglycemia on myocardial perfusion and coronary flow reserve in
      individuals with and without DM; and b) the effects of GLP-1 on myocardial perfusion and
      coronary flow reserve during euglycemia and hyperglycemia in DM. The investigators will
      recruit individuals with and without DM matched for age, gender and degree of obesity. The
      investigators will measure myocardial perfusion at rest and during vasodilator stress (to
      ascertain coronary flow reserve) while subjects are under controlled pancreatic clamp
      conditions during euglycemia (glucose ~100 mg/dl) and hyperglycemia (glucose ~250 mg/dl) in
      the presence and absence of concomitant GLP-1 infusion. The investigators believe that the
      translational significance of their studies is immense, impacting upon both acute and chronic
      cardiovascular disease manifestations. The effect of glycemic control on cardiovascular
      outcomes, morbidity and mortality remains an area of active investigation, fueled by the
      recent conflicting results of several large clinical trials (ACCORD, United Kingdom
      Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS), ADVANCE, VADT). If the investigators find that
      hyperglycemia is associated with altered myocardial perfusion, the mechanistic implications
      in the prevention and management of acute and chronic cardiovascular diseases in DM will be
      groundbreaking. Furthermore, if GLP-1 augments myocardial perfusion (as it does in the
      peripheral vasculature), the therapeutic benefits for prevention of cardiovascular events in
      this predisposed population are clear.

NCT01022151,Aminophylline and Cognitive Function After Sevoflurane Anaesthesia,"
      Early postoperative recovery of neurologic and cognitive functions is especially advantageous
      after fast-tracking ambulatory procedures to hasten home discharge after surgery.1 It is well
      known that volatile anaesthetic agents may generate adverse postoperative cognitive effects
      and even traces of it may affect task performance in healthy volunteers.2Hence, rapid
      elimination of the volatile anaesthetics may help reduce postoperative confusion and
      cognitive impairment in surgical patients by facilitating a faster recovery from general
      anaesthesia.3 Sevoflurane has been advocated for the routine anesthesia for ambulatory
      surgery patients. It activates adenosine A1 receptors in primary rat hippocampal cultures
      through the liberation of adenosine secondary to the interaction of with adenosine transport
      or key enzymes in adenosine metabolism.4 However; sevoflurane anaesthesia is associated with
      slower emergence and delayed early postoperative cognitive recovery than desflurane5 and
      xenon2 anaesthesia.

      Aminophylline, which is a hydrophilic cyclic adenosine mono-phosphate (cAMP) dependent
      phosphodiesterase inhibitor has been used for long time to antagonize the sedative effects of
      morphine, diazepam, and barbiturates.6-7Aminophylline in doses of 2-5 mg/kg shortens the
      recovery from sevoflurane anaesthesia and improves bispectral index scores (BIS) with
      concurrent increases in heart rate which might have a detrimental effect in patients with
      ischaemic heart disease.8-11However, the use of smaller doses of 2-3 mg/kg is associated with
      less increases in heart rate. 10-11 The use of 1 mg/kg of Doxapram is comparable to 2 mg/kg
      of aminophylline in improvement of early recovery from sevoflurane anaesthesia secondary to
      its central nervous system stimulating effect rather than increased ventilatory elimination
      of sevoflurane.11 Currently, there is no available published studies have investigated the
      effects of either theophylline or doxapram on early postoperative cognitive recovery after
      balanced anaesthesia with sevoflurane.

      We hypothesized that the use of small doses of aminophylline [2-3 mg/kg] may be comparable to
      larger doses in improvement of the early postoperative cognitive recovery from sevoflurane
      anaesthesia with associated non-significant increases in heart rate.

      The present study investigated the effects of 1 mg/kg of doxapram, and 2, 3, 4, and 5 mg/kg
      of aminophylline on the early postoperative cognitive recovery using the Short Orientation
      Memory Concentration Test (SOMCT), response entropy (RE) state entropy (SE), difference
      between RE and SE (RE-SE), end-tidal sevoflurane concentration, haemodynamics, the times to
      eyes opening and to extubation and degree of sedation after sevoflurane anaesthesia in
      patients undergoing ambulatory surgery.

      Diabetic patients are prone to a diffuse and rapidly progressive form of atherosclerosis.
      Both clinical and angiographic outcomes following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)
      are poor in patients with DM compared with those without DM. Autopsy study has shown delayed
      neointimal healing with inadequate endothelialization and persistent stent surface ﬁbrin
      deposition after DES implantation in DM patients. This might partially contribute to the high
      risk of late stent thrombosis.

      YINYI Polymer-Free paclitaxel stent is a domestic new type stent with bare metal base with
      micro porous surface. However, limited data is available in vivo about the surface coverage
      after stent implantation in DM patients because of lack of sensitive imaging modalities.
      Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an optical analogue of intravascular
      ultrasound（IVUS）that allows high-resolution tomographic intravascular imaging. Furthermore,
      several studies have demonstrated the feasibility of OCT to quantitatively evaluate the
      surface coverage and stent conditions in the follow up after PCI .

      Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze the surface coverage and late malapposition
      after two types of DES implantation in DM patients compared with non-DM patients by using OCT

NCT01022021,Peripheral Blood Stem Cell (PBSC) Mobilization in Patients With Relapsed Lymphoma Treated With Bendamustine,"
      Patients with certain types of cancer require treatment with very high doses of chemotherapy.
      A side effect of high chemotherapy doses is damage to the bone marrow where our blood and
      immune system cells are produced.

      Stem cells (or progenitor cells) are the source of all blood cells. They are formed in the
      bone marrow (the spongy cavity in the center of large bones). The stem cells receive signals
      that direct them to become red cells, white cells or platelets. This happens before they are
      released into the blood stream. Stem cells circulating in the blood stream can be collected
      through a process called ""apheresis"" or ""stem cell collection"". The cells are then processed
      and frozen to preserve them. After chemotherapy has been given the stem cells are thawed and
      given back intravenously (IV: into the vein), like a blood transfusion. The stem cells in the
      collection will find their way back into the bone marrow space and, after a few days, will
      start to produce the blood and immune cells as they normally would. Having your own stem
      cells collected and returned to you later is called an ""autologous transplant.""

      Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is a disease in which malignant cancer cells form in the lymph system.
      Autologous stem cell transplantation is the standard of care for a chemo-sensitive relapse in
      patients with large cell lymphoma that has spread.

      Bendamustine works by blocking the growth of cancer cells. It is used for the management of
      chronic lymphocytic leukemia and follicular lymphoma. Bendamustine in addition to rituximab
      (BR) is used in several trials in patients with lymphoma with encouraging results. Adequate
      peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) collection is a pre-requisite for high dose therapy
      followed by cell transplantation in patients with relapsed lymphoma. Exposure to previous
      multiple chemotherapy and radiation treatment may lead to poor mobilization of PBSC. It is
      not known whether pre-treatment with bendamustine will adversely affect the process of PBSC
      mobilization and harvest. On the other hand, it is assumed that high dose alkylating agents
      like cyclophosphamide may actually help in breaking the bond between stem cells and the
      stromal cells in the marrow cavity and hence may lead to a better mobilization of PBSC.

NCT01022008,Assessment Study of Faciocraniosynostosis by Craniofacial Osteodistraction,"
      Context. Faciocraniosynostoses present with an insufficient growth of the craniofacial
      skeleton due to premature fusion of skull and facial sutures. There are prenatal conditions
      with functional (risk of raised intracranial pressure) and morphological consequences
      (exorbitism, and impairment of upper respiratory airways), the severity of which justifies an
      early surgical treatment based on craniofacial osteotomies and osteodistraction techniques.

      Distraction techniques were started in our unit eleven years ago, and never ceased to be
      modified: Recent improvements allowed better correction of exorbitism and therefore reduction
      of visual risks. But the improvements of the respiratory function remain insufficient. The
      initial evaluations of the respiratory functions were based on blood oxygenation monitoring,
      and showed real improvement. But we have routinely screened our patients with complete
      polysomnography examinations for the past year, and this has always revealed the existence of
      severe sleep apnea syndromes that we fail to correct completely, although there were slightly
      improved.

      The aim of this PHRC protocol is :

        -  the qualitative and quantitative improvement of the respiratory status with a reinforced
           task force group including the specialists in genuine multidisciplinary approach.

        -  A modification of the surgical technique including modifications of the existing
           distraction devices, an increased number of implanted devices, and maybe a change in the
           surgical strategy.

      The investigators investigated the effect and predictors of effectiveness of massage in the
      treatment of patients with posterior shoulder stiffness. This is a randomized controlled
      trial study- massage and control (hand touch) two times a week for 4 weeks. A total of 60
      patients with posterior shoulder tightness were randomized into 2 groups; 52 of them
      completed this study (29 for the massage and 23 for the control). Patient sex, age, body mass
      index, glenohumeral internal rotation range of motion (ROM), duration of symptom, functional
      status, and muscle stiffness were recorded. Additionally, for the massage group, patients
      with glenohumeral internal rotation improvement of 20 degrees after massage were considered
      responsive, and the others were considered nonresponsive. The influences of the
      aftermentioned factors on the effectiveness of massage were analyzed by multivariate
      logistric regression. The overall mean internal rotation ROM increased significantly after
      massage (from 31.9° to 54.9°; P < 0.001) compared to the control (from 28.7° to 34.9°; P >
      0.05). There were 22 patients in the responsive group and 7 in the nonresponsive group. Among
      the factors, duration of symptoms, FLEX-SF score, and posterior deltoid stiffness were
      significant predictors of effectiveness of massage. Massage was an effective treatment for
      subjects with posterior shoulder stiffness, but was less effective in patients with longer
      duration of symptoms, higher functional limitation, and less posterior deltoid stiffness.

NCT01020929,Incidence of Simultaneous Epidural and Intravascular Injection,"
      The investigator hopes to learn the incidence of needle placement in both the epidural and
      intravascular space, and learn mixed epidural-intravascular pattern related to needle type,
      gauge, and level of injection. We also hope to evaluate the length of fluoroscopy time when
      using real time fluoroscopy during contrast dye injection, evaluate the radiation exposure to
      the hands of the physician during this protocol, and confirm the incidence fo intravascular
      injection and sensitivity of needle flash of blood, In the lumbar spine, vascular contrast
      patterns are more than twice as likely to appear simultaneous to the anticipated epidural
      pattern, than they are to occur alone. This is important since practitioners are more likely
      to miss a vascular pattern that occurs simultaneous to epidural spread, than they are to
      occur alone. The incidence of intravascular penetration in cervical transforaminal epidural
      injections is known to exceed that of lumbar injections, however no study has determined the
      incidence of simultaneous epidural and vascular injection in the cervical spine. This study
      may prove that real time fluoroscopy during contrast injection is warranted to prevent
      intravascular injection and resultant side effects to support this as standard of care.

      Intermittent fluoroscopy can yield false-negative results for intravascular injection when
      simultaneous epidural and intravascular injection occurs. This could lead to an increased
      risk of complication from intravascular injection of medications and reduce overall efficacy.
      No studies to date have quantified the incidence of needle placement located in both the
      intravascular space and epidural space simultaneously.

NCT01027000,Donor Stem Cell Transplant in Treating Patients With High-Risk Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia or Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma,"
      RATIONALE: Giving low doses of chemotherapy before a donor stem cell transplant helps stop
      the growth of cancer cells. It may also stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the
      donor's stem cells. Also, monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can find cancer cells and
      either kill them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells.
      The donated stem cells may replace the patient's immune cells and help destroy any remaining
      cancer cells (graft-versus-tumor effect). Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can
      also make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving tacrolimus, sirolimus,
      and methotrexate after the transplant may stop this from happening.

NCT01027403,"Evaluation of Circulating Levels of Adult Stem Cells in the Peripheral Blood of Patients With Acute Decompensated Heart Failure and Following Stabilization, in Comparison With Healthy Volunteers","
      Despite advances in medical technology, heart failure remains a major cause of illness on a
      global scale. Medical research, over recent years, has shown that adult stem cells (as
      opposed to embryonic stem cells) are present in most organs of adult humans. Their exact
      function is however poorly understood. An improved understanding of what these stem cells do
      and how they work is essential if effective stem cell treatments are to be developed in
      future.

NCT01028144,The Active by Choice Today (ACT) Trial to Increase Physical Activity,"
      The increasing prevalence of obesity in U.S. children and adolescents is a major health
      threat to our society, especially among minority and low social economic status (SES)
      populations. During adolescence physical activity (PA) decreases and is likely an important
      contributor to the increasing trend in childhood obesity rates. Little evidence suggests that
      school-based curriculum interventions lead to increases in overall PA. Thus, this proposal
      will evaluate the efficacy of an innovative motivational and behavioral skills after-school
      program for promoting increases PA among underserved adolescents (e.g., minorities, low SES).
      The motivational plus behavioral skills intervention is consistent with Self-Determination
      (Motivation) Theory and Social Cognitive Theory in that it emphasizes increasing intrinsic
      motivation and behavioral skills for PA. Adolescents in the intervention take part in
      developing the program, selecting physical activities that generate fun and interest, and
      generating their own coping strategies for making effective PA changes during a videotaped
      session. Preliminary data from our group demonstrates the feasibility of the motivational
      plus behavioral skills PA program for increasing moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) in
      underserved adolescents in South Carolina. The proposed project will use a school-based
      nested cohort design to evaluate efficacy of a 17-week motivational plus behavioral skills
      program versus typical after-school program (general health education only) on increasing PA
      in underserved adolescents. Twenty-four middle schools (70 6th graders per school; N=1,680),
      located in South Carolina will be randomly assigned to one of two after-school programs. The
      study employs a nested cohort design, with schools, rather than individuals assigned to
      condition and will be analyzed using repeated measures analysis of covariance techniques as
      outlined by Murray. We will also examine psychosocial variables (PA self-efficacy,
      self-concept, motivation, social support, and enjoyment) as potential mediators of the
      intervention on changes in MVPA using regression and structural equation modeling techniques.
      This study will address an important public health problem that will have implications for

NCT01020071,Prospective Evaluation of the Efficacy of Pascal Laser Iridotomy and Pascal Laser Peripheral Iridoplasty: A Pilot Study,"
      Objective: The main objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Pascal Laser
      Iridotomy and Pascal Laser Peripheral Iridoplasty in lowering intraocular pressure and
      opening up the angles in patients with narrow angles, primary angle closure and primary angle
      closure glaucoma.

      The specific objectives are to evaluate the pain and inflammation associated with the
      procedure and its possible adverse effects on the lens and corneal endothelium.

      Study Design: Prospective, interventional case series Study Population: Healthy males and
      females with appositional angle closure aged 21 y/o and above Methods: Potential participants
      are evaluated by a glaucoma specialist in National University Hospital. If they are
      identified as having appositional angle closure they are invited to participate in the study
      and assigned to either iridotomy or iridoplasty depending on the mechanism of angle closure
      present. Pupil block for Pascal Laser Iridotomy and plateau iris and angle crowding for
      Pascal Laser Peripheral Iridoplasty. If they agree to participate they will undergo visual
      acuity, slit lamp examination, intraocular pressure determination by Goldmann Applanation
      Tonometry, gonioscopy, optic nerve head evaluation by indirect ophthalmoscopy and lens
      evaluation by LOCS III opacity grading system. Humphrey visual field examination using 24-2
      SITA standard algorithm and stereodisc photos will be obtained if not done within the past 12
      months. Anterior segment OCT and laser flare meter will also be performed prior to the
      procedure. Enrolled patients will be divided into 2 groups. The first group will be assigned
      to Pascal Laser Iridotomy. The primary mechanism of angle closure in this group is pupillary
      block. The second group will be assigned to Pascal Laser Peripheral Iridoplasty. This group
      has non-pupil bock mechanisms which include plateau iris or angle crowding. After the laser
      procedure, follow-up examinations will be done 1 hr post laser, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months and
      6 months.

      Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measures are the intraocular pressure difference pre
      and post laser and the opening of angles. Secondary outcome measures are pain and
      inflammation associated with laser procedure, lens and corneal endothelial changes.

NCT01022710,Early Detection of Noise-Induced Hearing Loss,"
      This study measures sounds produced by the sensory receptors of the inner ear called hair
      cells. These sounds are called otoacoustic emissions and one special case the investigators
      are studying are called distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) produced by
      presenting two tones to the ear. If the ear is damaged by noise exposure DPOAEs are reduced.
      In this study the investigators are attempting to improve the DPOAE test by adding a third
      tone to make the test more frequency specific. Whether the third tone helps will be
      determined by comparing DPOAEs collected with and without the third tone to clinical
      audiograms. If the addition of the third tone helps then the investigators expect DPOAEs
      tracked as a function of frequency (DP-grams) will more closely match the clinical
      audiograms.

NCT01021501,The Pharmacokinetics of Nifedipine Controlled Release Tablets in Hypertensive Patients on Hemodialysis,"
      This is a prospective, open, non-randomized, non-controlled study. 20 patients with
      hypertension on chronic maintenance hemodialysis will be enrolled in the study. All patients
      had mild to moderate hypertension and are receiving antihypertensive agents.

      This study was designed to investigate effects of Adalat GITS on hemodialytic blood pressures
      in patients with chronic hemodialysis by using ABPM and measuring the drug plasma
      concentrations. For the purpose of investigating the influence of hemodialysis on the drug
      plasma concentration as well as its efficacy, it should be necessary to assign the subjects
      with the Adalat monotherapy. Since most patients in the hemodialysis center will be those who
      need and already receive combination therapy, it would be practical to start Adalat 60mg/day
      monotherapy to remain similar antihypertensive effect when discontinuing the previous
      treatment in this study population to be screened and enrolled. And taking into the
      consideration of clinical practice, few patients undergoing hemodialysis could be well
      controlled by low dose Adalat 30mg/day alone. So this study will evaluate the effect and
      safety of Adalat GITS 60mg/day alone and thereafter the influence of hemodialysis on the drug
      plasma concentration without any other possible drug interaction. The agents are given orally
      once a day at 08:00h and patients are followed for at least 4 weeks. After that,the patients
      whose blood pressure are well controlled by Adalat GITS 60mg/day by office blood pressure
      would be enrolled for further ABPM assessment and plasma concentration evaluation.

NCT01021579,"Effects of Metformin Plus Simvastatin on Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS): A Prospective, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study","
      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrinopathy affecting 6.5%-6.7% of women in
      reproductive age, and is commonly associated with obesity, menstrual irregularity, insulin
      resistance (IR), infertility, and clinical hyperandrogenism and/or hyperandrogenemia (1,2).
      PCOS is also associated with increased risk of abnormal lipoproteins and hypertension, as
      well as cardiovascular or cerebrovascular morbidity (3). The lipid and lipoprotein profile in
      androgenized women with poly cystic ovaries is similar to the made pattern with higher levels
      of cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and lower levels of high-density lipoprotein
      (HDL), and this abnormal pattern is independent of body weight (4). Insulin resistance is
      associated with reproductive abnormalities in women with PCOS. Improving insulin sensitivity
      through both lifestyle and pharmacological intervention can ameliorate these abnormalities.
      Insulin resistance in women with PCOS is common (up to 50%), both in obese and nonobese women
      (5), and disordered insulin action precedes the increase in androgen.

      Treatment for PCOS subjects typically includes, implementation of lifestyle changes
      especially weight loss and adjuvant pharmaceutical intervention including oral
      contraceptives, anti-androgen therapy and insulin-lowering drugs (such as, metformin) (6).
      Metformin is a biguanide used extensively in type 2 diabetes. It inhibits hepatic glucose
      production and increases peripheral insulin sensitivity, but dose not cause hypoglycemia.
      Several studies have shown an increase in insulin sensitivity and pregnancy rate accompanied
      by decreased insulin and androgen levels in PCOS patients taking metformin (7).

      The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-COA) reductase inhibitors (statins) are the
      rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis, and inhibition of this enzyme decreases
      cholesterol synthesis and a compensatory increase in the expression of LDL receptors in the
      liver. Statins reduce plasma triglycerides in dose-dependent fashion and also have a modest
      HDL-raising effect which is not dose-dependent (8,9). Furthermore, statins pose other
      cardio-protective properties, including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions (10,11).

      Some studies have reported that simvastatin decreases serum androgen levels in women with
      PCOS (12,13) by inhibiting proliferation and steroidogenesis of ovarian theca-interstitial
      cells (14). According to these previous findings, we hypothesized that combination therapy
      with simvastatin and metformin will result in lower androgen levels and cardiovascular risk
      factors in women with PCOS.

      Background:

      - Recent research has suggested that prenatal exposure to drugs may affect specific brain
      processes, including working memory, stress response, and decision making. However, most of
      the research on the effects of prenatal drug exposure in humans has been conducted early in
      life, and very little is known about effects of prenatal drug exposure during the crucial
      brain development period that takes place during puberty and adolescence. The biological and
      psychological changes associated with puberty may increase adolescents' sensitivity to
      prenatal substance exposure. Researchers are interested in using functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (fMRI) scans to study brain function and learn more about the effects of
      prenatal drug exposure on adolescents.

      Objectives:

      - To examine the effects of prenatal substance exposure on working memory, decision making,
      and normal brain activity in adolescents.

      Eligibility:

      - Adolescents between 12 and 17 years of age who are enrolled in a larger follow-up study of
      children exposed to drugs in utero.

      Objective: Recent non-randomized studies suggest that extended endoscopic submucosal
      dissection (ESD) is equally effective in removing large rectal adenomas as transanal
      endoscopic microsurgery (TEM). If equally effective, ESD might be a more cost-effective
      approach as this strategy does not require expensive equipment, general anesthesia and
      hospital admission. Furthermore, ESD appears to be associated with fewer complications. In a
      randomized trial we will compare the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of TEM and ESD for
      the resection of large rectal adenomas.

      Study design: 15 centers will participate in this multicenter randomized trial comparing TEM
      versus ESD.

      Study population: Patients with a large rectal adenoma (≥2cm), located between 2 and 15 cm
      from the anal verge. Invasive cancer is excluded by histopathology and endoscopic
      ultrasonography. Patients must be in a health condition that permits general anesthesia.

      Interventions: Patients will be randomized between

      a. TEM: under general anesthesia b. ESD under sedation

        1. a TEM tube will be inserted in the rectum. With specialized instruments the adenoma will
           be dissected en bloc by a full thickness excision, after which the patient will be
           admitted to the hospital.

        2. an endoscope will be inserted into the rectum and the submucosa underneath the lesion
           will be injected with saline to lift the adenoma. With an endoscopic knife (Insulated
           Tip Knife, Olympus or Water Jet, Erbe) the lesion will be resected through the
           submucosal plane in an eb-bloc fashion, after which the patient will be observed for at
           least 24h in-hospital.

      Primary Endpoint: incidence of recurrence at 12 months

      Secondary Endpoints:

      morbidity, subdivided into major (requiring surgery) and minor (requiring endoscopic or
      medical intervention) anorectal function. disease specific and general quality of life;
      number of days not spent in hospital from initial treatment until 2 years afterwards; adenoma

      Sample size: Assuming a comparable baseline recurrence rate for TEM and ESD of 6% and
      considering an upper limit of 10% for ESD to be non-inferior (beta-error 0.2 and one-sided
      alpha-error 0.05), 60 patients are needed per group. These numbers provide sufficient power
      to reveal relevant differences in expected morbidity and in number of days not spent in
      hospital.

      Economic evaluation: A cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis of ESD against TEM for
      large rectal adenomas from a societal perspective with respectively the costs per recurrence
      free patient and the cost per quality adjusted life year as primary outcome measures.

NCT01023308,Panobinostat or Placebo With Bortezomib and Dexamethasone in Patients With Relapsed Multiple Myeloma,"
      Panobinostat (LBH589) is a highly potent pan-deacetylase inhibitor (pan-DACi), inclusive of
      HDAC6, which disrupts aggresome function, promotes accumulation of cytotoxic misfolded
      protein aggregates and triggers myeloma cell death. Combination of pan-DAC and protease
      inhibition by co-treatment with panobinostat (PAN) and bortezomib (BTZ) has demonstrated
      synergistic cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo in pre-clinical experiments. Furthermore,
      clinical experience in advanced multiple myeloma (MM) patients treated by oral panobinostat
      and i.v bortezomib ± dexamethasone showed very encouraging results for efficacy and
      manageable toxicity profile.

      Given the medical need for improved treatment strategies for patients with previously treated
      and relapsed MM, the purpose of this prospective, multinational, randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, parallel group Phase III study is to compare the results in
      progression-free survival of 2 combination therapies, panobinostat with bortezomib and
      dexamethasone or placebo with bortezomib and dexamethasone, in patients with previously

NCT01025310,Visual Stress of the Open Urban Environment,"
      Background and objectives: There is a general agreement that some types of urban environment
      could be the source of psychological stress as opposed to natural-relaxing environment. A
      number of aesthetical researches found out that the main cause for stress appearance can be
      explained by the complexity and order of the environment. There are also some indications
      that the stressing influence of the open environment can be measured by evaluating eye
      movements, in particular saccadic movements.

      The objective of this study is to characterize eye movements - mainly saccades -while
      presenting visual material of different complexity and order and to evaluate the possible
      relationship between eye movements and parameters of psychological and physiological stress.

      Methods: The research is based on systematic gradual experiments on healthy volunteers, who
      will be tested while viewing series of abstract figures and pictures of natural and urban
      areas with different level of complexity and order. Each figure or picture will be showed to
      subjects for 7 seconds. During the whole experimental session the investigators will measure:

        1. Saccadic and other eye movements using the magnetic scleral search coil technique. The
           magnetic scleral search coil technique is the most sensitive and accurate technique used
           in modern ocular motor research for measuring horizontal, vertical and torsional eye
           movements. The coils are easy to apply and well tolerated over a wearing period of up to
           45 minutes per recording session.

        2. Heart rate pulse will be measured using a commercial pulse-meter.

        3. Aesthetical evaluation: Following each figure or picture 7 seconds presentation;
           subjects will rate it in a scale from 1 (very relaxing) to 10 (very stressful).

      Possible relationship between saccadic eye movements, heart rate and aesthetical rate will be
      analyzed using WIN 11 SPSS and MATLAB in statistically accepted ways.

      Population: A total of about 60 healthy subjects aged 18-60 years old will be recruited for
      the study from students, faculty and staff of Tel Aviv University and of Meir Medical Center.

      Criteria for inclusion: Healthy subject with normal vision

NCT01025726,Positive Action for Today's Health,"
      Regular moderate and vigorous intensity physical activity (PA) is inversely related with
      obesity, however, few adults are successful in incorporating sufficient PA into their daily
      lives. Minority and lower-income adults have among the highest obesity rates and lowest
      levels of regular PA. Increasing environmental supports for safe and convenient places for PA
      is an emerging public health strategy for PA interventions. Preliminary data by Wilson (PI)
      and colleagues has revealed through focus groups that low-income minority adults would like
      to increase the safe places for PA (areas free from crime, containment of stray dogs,
      increased police patrol) and access to PA (sidewalks/trails and expand opportunities for PA)
      in their community. In addition, the results of the investigators' preliminary studies
      suggest that African Americans had psychosocial barriers to PA that included lack of
      self-motivation, cultural body image issues, and lack of time due to family obligations. The
      present proposal is innovative in that it specifically tests the efficacy of an intervention
      that includes both patrolled-walking and social marketing elements to increase PA in
      low-income African Americans. Three communities will be randomized to receive one of three
      programs: a police patrolled-walking program plus social marketing intervention, a police
      patrolled-walking only intervention, or no walking intervention (general health education
      only; N=390; 130/group). The 24-month intervention will focus on increasing safety (training
      community leaders to serve as walking captains, hiring off-duty police officers to patrol the
      walking program, and containing stray dogs), increasing access for PA (marking a walking
      route), and will include a tailored social marketing campaign for increasing PA (in one
      intervention community). The investigators will collect data for PA (7-day accelerometer
      estimates, 4-week PA history), body composition, blood pressure, psychosocial measures, and
      perceptions of environmental supports for safety and access for PA at baseline, 6-,12-,18-,
      and 24-months. The primary hypotheses are that the patrolled-walking plus social marketing
      intervention will result in greater increases in moderate and vigorous PA as compared to a
      patrolled walking only intervention or no-intervention by 12-months and that these effects
      will be maintained at 18-month and 24-month assessments.

      Pegylated interferon in combination with ribavirin is the current standard treatment of
      chronic hepatitis C virus infection, but is expensive and has several adverse effects. To
      modify this standard treatment by optimizing its therapeutic effect and decreasing its
      adverse events are important. Recent studies have identified a close link between metabolic
      profiles, insulin resistance and Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection. Several pilot studies in
      western world have have found beneficial effects of oral hypoglycemic agents on chronic
      Hepatitis C (CHC) genotype 1 infected patients. Whether this concept still holds true in
      Taiwanese people remains unknown.

      The objective of this clinical trial is to evaluate the effect of oral hypoglycemic agents

      This study is designed as a prospective clinical trial aimed at investigating the mechanisms
      behind observed improvements in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) following bariatric surgery.
      The majority of patients with T2DM who are undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB)
      surgery, in particular, experience complete remission of T2DM almost immediately
      post-surgery. This response occurs before significant weight loss is possible. To assess the
      mechanisms involved with disease resolution, the investigators propose a study to evaluate
      patients at the UW Medical Center (UWMC) who have T2DM and are undergoing RYGB with G
      (gastronomy)-tube placement as part of their clinical care. The investigators are interested
      in this sub-population as the G-tube allows us the unique opportunity to evaluate glycemic
      control and insulin response following delivery or exclusion of nutrients to the otherwise
      bypassed portion of the gastrointestinal tract. The investigators hypothesize that nutrient
      delivery to the proximal GI tract will reverse RYGB-mediated improvements in glucose
      homeostasis, possibly in association with changes in nutrient-regulated gut peptides involved
      in glucose control.

NCT01026714,CYP2C9 Activity Evaluated With a Simple Finger Prick,"
      The cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP) are the major drug-metabolizing enzyme system in humans. A
      great inter- individual variability affects the activity of these enzymes, and consequently
      the plasma drug concentrations resulting in different pharmacodynamic effects and occurrence
      of effect sides. Environmental factors, diet, drugs or genetics are responsible for this
      variability. Genetic factors are very important since the majority of these enzymes are
      highly polymorphic. For example, over 80 CYP2D6 allelic variants have been discovered so far
      and are associated to the absence, a decrease, or an increase in enzyme activity. Most
      polymorphisms were detected by adverse reactions occurring in a group within the population
      after normal doses of drugs had been administrated. Those patients experiencing adverse
      reactions often had a reduced capability to metabolize certain drugs. In clinical therapy,
      this variability has important consequences including the lack of response to a treatment
      and/or adverse drug reactions. In order to reduce these potentially unwanted events possibly
      leading to sever adverse reactions or death, it might therefore be of decisive interest to be
      able to assess the activity of these enzymes at the individual level. Two approaches may be
      used to assess CYPs activities, genotype and phenotype. Genotype is based on DNA analysis and
      polymorphism detection. Phenotype consists of administration of ""model"" drug or probe drug
      metabolized by a specific CYP and a determination of a ratio between the drug and its
      metabolite in plasma or urine. The principal drawback of the phenotyping methods is the urine
      collection overnight or at least 8 hours after the administration of probe test. This
      procedure is very tedious and time consuming for the patient as well as for the medical
      staff. The test can be performed in plasma or blood 1-2 hours after probe administration.
      However, this procedure is invasive and needs an important volume of blood (6 ml). Recently,
      a novel approach has been developed for the quantitative determination of circulating drug
      concentrations using dried blood spots (DBS) on filter paper obtained with a simple finger
      prick. Due to the small blood volume required (about 10 µL) compared to conventional
      sampling, this minimally invasive method provides a patient-friendly alternative for blood
      collection in patient population where venous sampling is unethical or impossible
      (pediatrics).

      In addition, DBS sampling does not require the use of anticoagulant, plasma separation and
      decreases contact with infectious material. Furthermore, dried blood spots can be easily
      stored and shipped to analytical laboratories without using refrigerated devices.

      Thanks to the new developments in analytical techniques (mass spectrometry), which permit
      quantitative analysis from very small volume of blood. DBS sampling represents a powerful
      tool for the biomedical analyses, particularly in pharmacokinetic studies where several blood
      samples are needed and for phenotyping procedures.

      Erlotinib is a type of drug called a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). TKIs block a protein
      called epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). EGFR may control tumor growth and tumor cell
      survival. EGFR is found on the surface of many types of cancer cells, including non-small
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Erlotinib is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for
      the treatment of NSCLC. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is a drug approved by the FDA for treatment
      of malaria, rheumatoid arthritis, and several other diseases but is not currently thought of
      as a cancer treatment. Previous laboratory studies suggests that HCQ may have an anti-cancer
      effect by itself in some situations, particularly when EGFR TKI drugs have been useful in the
      past against the tumor. The two drugs together may be able to fight lung cancer in cases
      where erlotinib is no longer effective by itself. The purpose of this research study is to
      determine the highest dose of HCQ that can be given safely in combination with erlotinib. We

NCT01026883,Evaluation of a Novel Method for Hematocrit Level Determination,"
      The hematocrit level is defined as the ratio of plasma volume and red blood cell mass.
      Determination of this level is important for the diagnosis and follow-up of various
      hematological and renal disorders. In clinical practice, automated hematology analyzers are
      commonly used.

      Recently, a new method for hematocrit level determination has been introduced which employs
      layered resonant piezoelectric sensors. In the present study this technique will be applied
      in blood samples of healthy subjects and compared to a standard laboratory method.

NCT01026935,The Outcome After Lichtenstein Operation vs. ProGrip Patch Repair of Inguinal Hernia,"
      For the present study, 400 consecutive men with unilateral primary inguinal hernia are
      randomized to Lichtenstein repair using either light weight polypropylene mesh (38g/m2) or
      light weight ProGrip mesh. ProGrip mesh adheres to tissues with polylactic micro hooks
      without suturing. The primary aim is to examine, whether the ProGrip mesh produces less pain
      than sutured polypropylene mesh. Secondary outcomes are operation time and convalescence as
      well as recurrence rate. ProGrip mesh is supposed to be faster to apply as no sutures are
      needed, which may compensate for its higher cost. The patients are blinded to which mesh they
      receive.

NCT01027286,Prospective Evaluation of Vitagel for Reduction in Blood Loss and Pain Following Unilateral Total Knee Arthroplasty,"
      Vitagel® is an FDA approved class III medical device. It is a surgical hemostat, which has
      been shown to control bleeding during orthopaedic, cardiac, hepatic, and general surgical
      procedures. The product is a thrombin/collagen suspension which works in combination with the
      patient's own plasma to form a fibrin/collagen clot.

      The present prospective, randomized controlled trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy of
      Vitagel® for reducing blood loss and pain in patients managed with unilateral total knee
      arthroplasty (TKA). It is hypothesized that the use of Vitagel® may lead to less blood filled
      knees, and thus to a greater improvement in postoperative pain scores when compared to the
      control group. The two arms of the study will include:

        1. experimental group in which Vitagel® is used unilateral TKA

        2. control group representing our current standard of care (no Vitagel®)

      A comparison of the functional and clinical results between these two groups will be
      conducted using several outcome measures including the KOOS, SF-12 version2 and pain scores
      through the previously IRB approved OrthoMidas registry. The primary variable of interest is
      blood loss, based on hemoglobin drop during the postoperative hospital stay. Of secondary
      interest will be; 1) pain levels in the PACU, 2) pain scores for all postoperative days, 3)
      average pain for the entire hospital stay, 4) length of stay, 5) patient satisfaction at
      discharge, 4 weeks postoperative, and 12 weeks postoperative, and 6) functional scores at 4

      STARS: Sistas Talking About Real Solutions is a health education intervention for
      African-American women, ages 18-29 aimed at reducing their risk for HIV. A total of 855
      subjects were recruited from three Kaiser Permanente Medical Centers. Members were randomly
      selected from the membership database and sent a letter via mail introducing them to the
      project and inviting them to participate. Letters were followed up with a phone call and
      potential participants were screened for eligibility. To be able to participate, participants
      had to be African-American, female, between the ages of 18-29, single, and have at least one
      act of unprotected sexual intercourse within the last 6 months. Members who were eligible and
      willing to participate completed a 1-hour baseline assessment survey; STD testing for
      Chlamydia, gonorrhea, trichomoniasis, and HPV; a vaginal swab that was used to determine if
      they had unprotected sex. They were then randomized into one of two study conditions: (1) a
      2-session HIV risk-reduction condition with a safer sex relapse prevention component (2) a
      1-session control condition in which participants receive general women's health information
      and brochures. Participants received a booster session at 6 and 9 months to reinforce
      intervention materials. Participants completed an assessment survey and received STD testing
      at 6 and 12 months. The primary aim of this project is to evaluate the efficacy of the HIV
      risk-reduction/safer sex relapse prevention condition relative to the health and nutritional
      control group in reducing HIV-associated sexual behaviors and incident STDs over a 12-month

      using supplements with L. reuteri as much in infected symptomatic patients as asymptomatic
      with H. pylori showed a clear reduction of the load of bacteria after 4 weeks of use and this
      was concordant with a reduction in the symptoms associated to the infection.

NCT01028703,Effects of a Reduction in Kidney Function on Cardiovascular Structure and Function: A Prospective Study of Kidney Donors,"
      Studies of patients with established kidney disease, even when this is mild, appear to show
      that they are at high risk of heart failure, stroke and sudden cardiac death. This may be
      because kidney disease causes stiffening of the arteries in the body which means that the
      heart and brain are damaged by high blood pressure. By studying patients before and after the
      removal of a kidney (uni-nephrectomy) for transplantation the investigators will find out for
      the first time in man the effect of an isolated reduction in kidney function on the structure
      and function of the arteries and heart.

      Hypotheses. An isolated reduction in GFR occuring after surgical uni-nephrectomy is
      associated with long term adverse cardiac and vascular effects which include:

        1. Increased arterial stiffness and left ventricular mass

        2. Abnormalities in left ventricular systolic and diastolic function

NCT01028716,Donor Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplant in Treating Patients With Hematologic Malignancies,"
      This phase II trial studies how well donor peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplant works
      in treating patients with hematologic malignancies. Cyclophosphamide when added to tacrolimus
      and mycophenolate mofetil is safe and effective in preventing severe graft-versus-host
      disease (GVHD) in most patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing transplantation of
      bone marrow from half-matched (haploidentical) donors. This approach has extended the
      transplant option to patients who do not have matched related or unrelated donors, especially
      for patients from ethnic minority groups. The graft contains cells of the donor's immune
      system which potentially can recognize and destroy the patient's cancer cells
      (graft-versus-tumor effect). Rejection of the donor's cells by the patient's own immune
      system is prevented by giving low doses of chemotherapy (fludarabine phosphate and
      cyclophosphamide) and total-body irradiation before transplant. Patients can experience low
      blood cell counts after transplant. Using stem cells and immune cells collected from the
      donor's circulating blood may result in quicker recovery of blood counts and may be more
      effective in treating the patient's disease than using bone marrow.

NCT01029717,CATCH - Catheter Infections in Children,"
      Most children admitted to paediatric intensive care units (PICU) need to have medicines given
      to them into their veins using a narrow tube, so they do not need repeated injections. This
      tube is called a central venous catheter. Occasionally these catheters can cause infections
      in the blood and sometimes the tubes can get blocked by small blood clots.

      Some intensive care units already use antibiotic or heparin coated catheters, but there is no
      proof that these are better than the standard ones at preventing infections. Most of the
      PICU's in this country use standard lines. The only way to find out for certain is to compare
      children who are given antibiotic or heparin coated catheters with those who are given
      standard ones in a clinical trial. Because we do not know which type of catheter is best, the
      type of catheter each child receives in the study will be decided randomly by chance.

      Each child in the trial will have the same chance of getting any of these three catheters:

        -  Standard central venous catheter (not coated).

        -  Heparin coated central venous catheter. Heparin is a medicine that can stop blood from
           clotting and might stop the tubes being blocked and infections in the blood.

        -  Antibiotic coated central venous catheter. Antibiotics can be used to kill bacteria
           which cause the infections.

      The aim of this study is to see how the three types of catheters compare in reducing the
      amount of blood infections in children. We will also look at the costs involved. We hope to
      recruit 1200 children in the UK over 2 years. We hope that the information we get from this
      study will guide policy about purchasing impregnated Central Venous Catheters across the NHS
      and thereby improve treatment for children in the future.

NCT01023191,Open Versus Percutaneous Insertion of CAPD Catheters,"
      Healthy kidneys clean your blood by removing excess fluid, minerals, and wastes. When your
      kidneys fail, harmful wastes build up in your body and your body may retain excess fluid.
      When this happens, you need treatment to replace the work of your failed kidneys. This may be
      with a dialysis machine using haemodialysis or with fluid in the abdomen or peritoneal
      dialysis.

      In peritoneal dialysis, a tube called a catheter is put in the abdomen wall and used to fill
      your abdomen with a cleansing liquid called dialysis solution. The walls of your abdominal
      cavity are lined with a membrane called the peritoneum, which allows waste products and extra
      fluid to pass from your blood into the dialysis solution. These wastes and fluid are removed
      from the body when the dialysis fluid is drained and replaced with a fresh solution.

      The tubes or catheters used to exchange the fluid are currently positioned using a general
      anaesthetic (with the patient awake) and an operation with a cut under the belly button.
      Newer techniques using local anaesthetic (with the patient awake and the area numbed) and
      requiring only a small cut in the skin have been used. No one has ever directly compared the
      two techniques.

      The investigators aim is to perform a direct comparison between the two techniques to look at
      the complications and time required for surgery and length of hospital stay required. The
      investigators will also look at the patients satisfaction and pain scores with each technique
      to help gather evidence as to which is likely to be the best technique to use from now on.

      arteries) is a known complication after SAH and significantly increases disability and death
      after SAH. Vasospasm is difficult to treat and can lead to stroke. Animal studies have shown
      that the muscles in the artery wall play a role in cVSP.

      Dantrolene has been FDA approved and extensively used in clinical practice as a muscle

      pregnancy. The intrauterine device (IUD) is a highly effective form of birth control. It is
      inserted into the uterus and prevents pregnancy for either 5 or 10 years, depending on the
      type of IUD (hormone-releasing or copper). The hormone-releasing IUD works for 5 years and
      releases a hormone called a progestin into the uterus. The copper IUD contains no hormones
      and works for 10 years. The IUD is an excellent form of birth control postpartum, but it is
      unknown if the hormone-releasing IUD will affect blood sugars and increase a woman's risk of
      becoming diabetic when she's not pregnant. The hypothesis is that the hormone-containing IUD
      will NOT increase blood sugars, so women who use the hormone-containing IUD will have similar
      blood sugars to those who use the copper IUD or have had their tubes tied (no hormones).

      This research study is to examine the effects of the study medication Armodafinil in patients
      with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB).

      DLB is associated with memory and other thinking problems, excessive daytime sleepiness,
      hallucinations, delusions, apathy, and reduced quality of life.

      One type of medication that could potentially improve daytime sleepiness, memory and thinking
      skills, hallucinations, delusions, apathy, and quality of life is known as a wake-promoting
      medication. Armodafinil is a wake-promoting medication that has been developed for treatment
      of patients with narcolepsy, sleep apnea, and other disorders which cause excessive daytime
      sleepiness.

      The drug used in this study is considered investigational, which means it has either not been
      approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for routine clinical use or for the use
      described in this study. However the FDA has allowed the use of this drug/device in this
      research study.

      In this study, patients with DLB will receive daily oral Armodafinil tablets, and their
      response to treatment will be assessed over 12 weeks. This study does not involve any placebo
      medication, so all patients will receive Armodafinil treatment.

      This proposal represents a unified programme supported by both clinical and academic staff in
      the Departments of Paediatrics at Imperial College and St Mary's Hospital, Southampton
      Hospital and John Radcliffe Hospital (Oxford). St Mary's Hospital is the hub of a paediatric
      network for West London, and forms part of the Paediatric Intensive Care Network for the
      London region, with potential access to a population of 3 million children.

      We aim to improve diagnosis and understanding of children with infectious, inflammatory and
      allergic conditions. Our study will establish well-characterised cohorts of patients with
      defined conditions, in whom microbiological and patient samples will be used to understand
      the contribution of genetic background, differential gene expression, proteomics and the
      pathogen type to the disease process.

      Unwell children coming to hospital through any route will be invited to join the study.
      Entering the study will entail the child having blood taken for research purposes in addition
      to the clinically indicated tests. We will also recruit well (control) children who are
      having blood tests performed for elective purposes, such as surgery.

      In addition, children presenting with an illness that is likely to have an infectious
      aetiology will also have samples collected for microbiological diagnosis. Those samples taken
      for ordinary diagnostic purposes (such as blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF),
      bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid or nasal brushings for epithelial cell cultures) would
      also be used for state-of-the-art diagnostic techniques, in order to maximise the likelihood
      of confirming a microbiological diagnosis. Where healthy, uninfected children are having
      invasive procedures, such as lumbar punctures, we would aim to recruit these children as
      controls and collect biological samples such as CSF samples.

      This bid addresses the need for translational research in paediatrics, by building on the
      world-class basic science and clinical paediatric base at Imperial College and St Mary's

NCT01023828,K-RAS Oncogene Mutation in Patients With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Associated With Exposure to Wood Smoke and Tobacco Smoking: Therapeutic Implications,"
      Summary:

      Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer-related death in the world.
      This neoplasia has a poor survival prognosis due to the low effectiveness of existing
      treatments. The low effectiveness is associated with the development of an intrinsic and
      acquired resistance of tumors, which clinically shows through early progression and
      transitory responses. Tobacco smoking is the major risk factor for NSCLC; however, wood smoke
      has been described as a strong carcinogen and a relevant risk factor for the development of
      NSCLC. Current data indicates that lung tumors associated with tobacco smoking and wood smoke
      show different clinical characteristics, which suggests that they might also have different
      genetic alterations, which are a consequence of tumor etiology. The description of the
      frequency and the type of mutations associated with different etiologies of NSCLC could
      represent the starting point for benefiting each patient according to their specific
      characteristics. One of the most researched signaling pathways related to cancer cell
      proliferation is the one activated by the K-RAS oncogene. Active K-RAS mutations have been
      detected in different types of neoplasia and more than 90% of these mutations occur at codon
      12 of the oncogene. These mutations seem to be an independent risk factor for the prognosis
      of malignant tumors and they are associated with the lack of response to erlotinib, which is
      a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor. The investigators' research team has recently reported that wood
      smoke is an independent factor for survival and response to the erlotinib treatment, which
      suggests that this carcinogen could have a different frequency and pattern of mutations in
      the K-RAS oncogene, compared to what has been reported in smoking patients. Determining the
      tumor mutations within the K-RAS oncogene can help improve the response prognosis of patients
      with advanced NSCLC who have a background of exposure to different factors associated with
      the appearance of this neoplasia, such as wood smoke exposure or tobacco smoking. Therefore,
      the objective of this research is to determine the frequency and the type of mutations at
      codon 12 of the K-RAS oncogene in patients with NSCLC who have a background of exposure to
      tobacco smoking or wood smoke.

NCT01021384,Supporting the Well Being of Families of Young Children With Autism Spectrum Disorders,"
      The objective of this 2 year research project is to determine whether an evidenced-based
      empowerment strategy, Problem Solving Education (PSE), targeted to mothers of young children
      with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), promotes family well-being by decreasing the burden of
      maternal depressive symptoms and maternal parenting stress and improving social functioning.
      We propose a randomized control trial involving 140 mothers who have children <4 years with
      confirmed ASDs. Based on the paradigm of the IOM report on mental health prevention research
      that highlights the importance of targeting interventions to at-risk populations who may not
      meet diagnostic criteria, all mothers of young children with ASDs will be eligible to
      participate. Consistent with previous studies of cognitive-behavioral interventions, the
      mother-child pairs will be followed for 9 months. The intervention will be embedded in two
      settings that provide services to young children with ASDs - Early Intervention (EI) programs
      and specialty developmental assessment clinics. We aim to support families during a critical
      juncture - when they are confronted with a new diagnosis and are asked to navigate a complex
      service system on their children's behalf. The hypothesis of this proposal is that
      strengthening problem solving skills among mothers of young children with ASDs serve as an
      important buffer against the negative impact of life stressors, and thereby prevent and
      attenuate depressive symptoms and parenting stress.

NCT01023087,Renal Impairment Associated With Colistin Levels,"
      Colistin is a relatively old antibiotic drug which its use has been abandoned through the
      1970s because it was considered nephrotoxic.

      Recently ( the last decade) it has been reappraised because multidrug resistant Gram negative
      bacteria have emerged causing life threatening infections with no other good enough
      treatment. Moreover, more controlled studies from the recent years show less toxic effect of
      the drug.

      The investigators' study is a prospective study comparing renal function in a group of
      hospitalized patients with sepsis (infection) receiving intravenous treatment with Colistin
      (antibiotics) with a control group which its patients receive other non nephrotoxic
      antibiotics.

      The investigators' study hypothesis is that patients receiving Colistin would have renal
      function decline in higher rates than those seen usually in hospitalized patients in the
      Internal medicine wards with sepsis.

      Another goal of the study is to find correlation between Colistin levels in the plasma (after
      Colistin reaches steady state) and nephrotoxicity seen during or after use of this drug.

NCT01027325,Resistant Starch Insulin Sensitivity Trial,"
      The alarming increase in the prevalence of obesity is a cause of great concern given its
      association with many adverse health conditions, including insulin resistance and type 2
      diabetes, which are associated with increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. The primary
      objective of this project is to identify effective dietary strategies, focused on
      carbohydrate quantity and starch digestibility, to improve outcome variables associated with
      CVD risk in insulin resistant individuals who express components of the atherogenic
      lipoprotein phenotype (ALP). Current dietary guidelines emphasize substitution of
      carbohydrate calories for total and saturated fat calories for prevention and management of
      chronic disease. Yet, we and others have shown that high-carbohydrate diets increase the
      expression of the ALP, characterized by increased plasma triglycerides, reduced HDL
      cholesterol, and increased levels of small, dense LDL particles, and that this phenotype is
      reversed by moderate carbohydrate restriction. We have also shown that expression of stearoyl
      coenzymeA desaturase (SCD), an enzyme involved in triglyceride synthesis, is reduced with
      carbohydrate restriction and that this change is correlated with plasma triglyceride
      response. While carbohydrate restriction is effective for management of ALP, the role of
      starch quality has not been addressed. Furthermore, there has been no study of the effects of
      resistant vs. digestible starches incorporated into high- vs. lower carbohydrate diets. Since
      isolated reports suggest that increased intake of resistant starch lowers plasma
      triglycerides and postprandial insulinemia, we hypothesize that starch quality is an
      important determinant of components of ALP, and that this may be mediated in part by reduced
      adipose tissue SCD expression. Aim 1 and of this proposal will address this hypothesis by a
      controlled dietary intervention in 52 insulin resistant men and women in which changes in
      plasma lipids, lipoproteins and lipogenic gene expression will be determined after
      substituting resistant starch for digestible starch in a high- vs. lower-carbohydrate diet.
      In Aim 2, the fasting and postprandial glucose and insulin responses to a resistant vs.
      digestible starch meal will be measured to test the hypothesis that starch digestibility
      improves glycemic and insulinemic control in a way that relates to diet-induced changes in
      plasma lipids and lipoproteins.

      The purpose of this study is to perform laboratory based studies to determine if the growth
      and development of the malaria parasite is effected by iron status of its host (the person
      infected with the malaria parasite). Iron deficiency affects over 500 million people
      including many pregnant women and children from areas of the world that are plagued by
      malaria. Some population based studies have suggested that iron deficiency protects people
      from getting malaria and this has raised questions about the wisdom of public health policies
      that provide universal iron supplementation in countries where malaria is common. We will use
      red blood cells and sera from patients with iron deficiency anemia, hereditary
      hemochromatosis and normal individuals who are taking iron supplements to look at this
      question in a very systematic way. This study should provide information for or against a
      possible mechanism by which iron deficiency may affect the malaria parasite. The results will
      contribute to efforts to develop evidence-based public health policies on iron
      supplementation policies in malaria-endemic areas.

      to reduce eye discomfort (topical anesthetics) during and after eye injections. Dr. Pollack
      is performing a research study to evaluate three commercially available topical anesthetics
      (eye numbing treatments) to determine if individuals have a preference for one over the
      other. The three topical anesthetics being studied are 1) 0.5% proparacaine hydrochloride
      (generic, Akorn, Inc), 2) 0.5% proparacaine hydrochloride (generic, Akorn, Inc) PLUS 4%
      lidocaine hydrochloride topical solution (generic, Roxane Laboratories), and 3) 3.5%
      lidocaine hydrochloride ophthalmic gel (Akten, Akorn, Inc). These eye anesthetics are NOT
      experimental medications. They are all commercially available topical anesthetics currently
      used in our offices and their use is widespread among retina specialists throughout the
      United States. Dr. Pollack will randomly select one topical anesthetic to use and he will ask
      you to grade your level of pain associated with the injection procedure. Answering these
      questions should take less than one minute of your time and your identity will NOT be
      revealed with the results of this study. The results of this study will be used to inform
      doctors which eye anesthetics patients find most effective for pain control during eye
      injections.

NCT01026779,Rotavirus Gastroenteritis and Vaccine Usage in Rhode Island,"
      The goals of this study are to see what effects the introduction of RV5(RotaTeq) vaccine has
      had in the community both on the number of rotavirus-associated hospitalizations and on the
      strains of rotavirus circulating in the community. The investigators will use cases of
      rotavirus gastroenteritis identified on the wards at Hasbro Children's Hospital during the
      2007-2009 rotavirus seasons for a case-control study to estimate rotavirus vaccine
      effectiveness in preventing rotavirus-associated hospitalizations. The investigators plan to
      assess rotavirus vaccine coverage in Rhode Island using the state vaccine registry and to
      examine whether and to what extent rotavirus vaccine was used outside the recommended age
      limits (off label) during the first 2 years of its implementation in Rhode Island. Finally
      using the state child health database, KIDSNET the investigators plan to investigate the
      reasons that children may not have received rotavirus vaccine in order to better target
      educational efforts for parents and health care providers.

      Women with a BRCA1 mutation face a lifetime risk of breast cancer of approximately 70% and a
      lifetime risk of ovarian cancer of approximately 40%. A number of potential anti-cancer
      nutrients have been proposed, however, it is important that diet supplements be evaluated
      prior to general recommendation.

      The risk of breast and ovarian cancer in carriers of a BRCA1 mutation might be lowered by
      some nutritional supplements. For example, green tea, broccoli and vitamin D are of potential
      interest. One dietary supplement that is thought to have potential for BRCA1 carriers is
      diindolylmethane (DIM), which is an active ingredient in broccoli and other green vegetables.
      DIM - is found in vegetables like broccoli and is available as a supplement in health food
      stores. The investigators think that DIM may increase the production of the normal copy of
      BRCA1 and offset the effect of the mutation.

      The purpose of this study is to determine that there is a potential for oral DIM
      supplementation to result in the increased production of the BRCA1 protein in BRCA1 mutation
      carriers. The results of the study will also serve as an evaluation of the current use and

NCT01029587,Eculizumab to Enable Renal Transplantation in Patients With History of Catastrophic Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome,"
      Catastrophic Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome (CAPS) is a rare condition in which
      life-threatening blood clots form in multiple organs simultaneously and can lead to
      multi-organ system failure and death. The causes of CAPS are not entirely understood, but
      CAPS episodes are often triggered by stressful events such as infections, surgery, or trauma.
      For patients who survive an episode of CAPS, permanent kidney failure is not uncommon because
      the kidneys are the organ system most frequently affected in CAPS. Kidney transplantation is
      the treatment of choice for end-stage kidney disease, but patients with a history of CAPS are
      exceptionally high-risk kidney transplant recipients because the chance that surgery itself
      could trigger a life-threatening or transplant-threatening episode of CAPS is significant. As
      a result, patients with CAPS are not generally considered candidates for transplantation.
      Despite this, these patients have a severely decreased life-expectancy on dialysis and their
      long-term survival and quality of life would be greatly increased by a successful kidney
      transplant. In this trial, a drug called eculizumab will be tested for its ability to prevent
      CAPS after kidney transplantation in patients with a prior history of CAPS. Eculizumab is an
      inhibitor of the complement system, which is believed to be important in generating the
      inflammatory environment that leads to diffuse clotting of blood vessels in CAPS. The
      investigators hypothesize that by blocking the complement cascade using eculizumab, in
      conjunction with blocking the coagulation system, that kidney transplantation can be safely
      and successfully performed in patients with a history of CAPS.

NCT01029964,A Three-year Behavioral Treatment of Obese Children,"
      The prevalence of overweight and obesity among children and adolescents has reached epidemic
      proportions worldwide. Among Swedish 10-year old children 15-20% are overweight and 3-5% are
      obese. The probability that an obese child becomes an obese adult is very high. This chronic
      disease requires lifetime treatment. The standard treatment of childhood obesity involves
      behavioural interventions focused on eating habits and physical activity. Studies often
      include small study samples, the absence of control groups and short treatments times.
      Several long-term follow-up studies of shorter interventions are available. The results from
      these studies are disappointing since the number of children who are ""cured"" i.e., have
      become non-obese is low. Thus, effective treatments are currently lacking.The National
      Childhood Obesity Center treats children in a University hospital setting. The children are
      enrolled from the catchment areas of the hospital as well as the rest of Sweden. Treatment
      alternatives include behavioural treatment (individual and group), low and very low calorie
      diet, pharmacological and surgical treatment. Patients treated with surgical and
      pharmacological methods safety is ensured using these treatments exclusively in controlled
      studies. The clinic was the first in Sweden with this wide range of treatment options.

NCT01022918,Evaluation of the Irinotecan/Bevacizumab Association for Naive Unresectable Glioblastoma,"
      Treatment of glioblastoma (GBM) is based on surgery when possible, and chemoradiation with
      temozolomide, which became a standard since the EORTC study (Stupp, 2005). However, the
      prognosis of unresectable GBM remains poor despite chemoradiation with an estimated 10 month
      median survival, in the range of the comparable patients in the RPA class V from the EORTC
      study (Miramanoff, 2006).

      Vredenburgh et al. from the Duke University (Durham, NC) reported at ASCO 2006 (fully
      published in J Clin Oncol, 2007) a 57 % unexpected response rate using a
      bevacizumab/irinotecan schedule in patients with relapsed GBM or grade 3 astrocytomas. This
      unusual high response rate, sometimes with major and sustained responses, was confirmed by a
      cooperative french study of ANOCEF (Guiu et al., 2008). Such a major improvement of treatment
      effectiveness lead ANOCEF, which federates most of the active neuro-oncology teams in France,
      to propose a neo-adjuvant and adjuvant bevacizumab-based chemotherapy framing a standard
      temozolomide-based chemoradiation with the aim to improve the prognosis of unresectable GBM.

      The bevacizumab/temozolomide combination as neo-adjuvant is presently being evaluated by the
      Duke University. We believe that an ambitious comparison of the
      bevacizumab/irinotecan-schedule with the ''standard'' temozolomide-based chemoradiation is a
      fascinating challenge to improve the treatment of this awful disease.

      Not infrequently, a physician is faced with uncertainty regarding the ability of a patient to
      perform adequate exercise in the noninvasive evaluation of known or suspected coronary artery
      disease (CAD) by the use of radionuclide stress myocardial perfusion imaging. In selected
      patients, protocols that combine exercise (either low-level or symptom-limited) with
      vasodilator stress agents have been found to be safe and effective in both identification of
      the presence and severity of CAD as well as risk stratification for adverse cardiac outcome.
      However, currently utilized combined stress protocols have drawbacks. Further refinement of
      combined stress protocols would potentially lead to more appropriate stress protocol
      selection for patients while enhancing laboratory efficiency. The purpose of this

      Gefitinib is an orally active epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor
      (EGFR-TKI) and produces 8-20% of response rates in patients with advanced non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC). Vorinostat (suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid [SAHA]) is a small-molecule
      inhibitor of histone deacetylase (HDAC) and induces cell differentiation, cell cycle arrest,
      and apoptosis in several tumor cells. There is a strong synergistic antiproliferative effect
      of vorinostat in combination with gefitinib in NSCLC cells. Vorinostat increases expression
      of E-cadherin and ErbB-3, which results in increased sensitivity to gefitinib. Moreover,
      In-vitro studies have shown that vorinostat leads to acetylation and disruption of Hsp90,
      which may lead to decreases in activity of pro-growth and prosurvival client proteins (J Bio
      Chem 2005;280:26729, Br J Cancer 2006;95:S2). These findings suggest that combination of

      Major surgery is still associated with a high rate of postoperative morbidity despite
      improved techniques in surgical management. Surgery-induced alterations of the immune system
      are well described and may play a role in the genesis of postoperative complications. It has
      been shown by several large scale clinical trials, that the use of immunonutrition in
      postoperative cancer surgery, trauma and critically ill patients resulted in an improved
      immunocompetence and/or reduced postoperatively infectious morbidity and/or length of
      hospital stay.The pre-operative regimen was between 5 to 7 days of treatment. The aim of this
      trial is to evaluate if a shorter administration of 3 days pre-operatively would be

NCT01027052,Spices Inhibit the Formation and Absorption of Malondialdehyde From Hamburger Meat,"
      Polyphenols belong to the largest group of secondary metabolites produced by plants, mainly,
      in response to biotic or abiotic stresses such as infections, wounding, UV irradiation,
      exposure to ozone, pollutants, and other hostile environmental conditions. It is thought that
      the molecular basis for the protective action of polyphenols in plants is their antioxidant
      and free radical scavenging properties. These numerous phenolic compounds are major
      biologically active components of spices, aromas, essential oils, and traditional medicines.
      In order to investigate the impact of spice polyphenols on postprandial cytotoxic lipid
      peroxidation products (MDA) levels in humans, the investigators propose to achieve the
      following specific aims using a randomized crossover study design:

        1. To determine the effect of a ground beef patty meal with and without spices on
           postprandial levels of plasma malondialdehyde (MDA).

        2. To determine the effect of a ground beef patty meal with and without a spice blend on
           MDA accumulation in urine.

      This study will determine whether spice polyphenols exert a beneficial effect by inhibition
      of the absorption of MDA. These findings may help to explain the potentially harmful effects
      of oxidizable fats found in foods and the important benefit of dietary polyphenols in
      ameliorating this potentially harmful effect.

NCT01021033,Screening Protocol for Patients With Stroke,"
      Background:

        -  Stroke, also known as acute cerebrovascular attack, is the leading cause of long-term
           disability worldwide. Stroke survivors are often left with permanent physical and mental
           disabilities.

        -  Many stroke patients receive different therapies in an attempt to improve their
           independence and quality of life. However, current strategies are focused on the acute
           stage after stroke and are of limited influence in improving stroke outcome. One of the
           main problems of patients who have suffered a stroke is the difficulty in using the hand
           on the opposite side of the affected hemisphere of the brain; to date, researchers have
           no successful means to improve the hand function in chronic stages of stroke.

        -  Researchers are interested in developing a pool of individuals for further research into
           hand and motor function after a stroke.

      Objectives:

      - To perform a screening evaluation of patients referred with stroke to determine their
      eligibility for current and future protocols studying the effects of stroke on the nervous
      system and motor function.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals who have experienced a single stroke on only one side of the brain that
      occurred at least 3 months prior to participation in the screening study. Individuals must
      have some residual hand motor function.

      Design:

        -  Participants in this study will be recruited from patient referrals.

        -  Eligible participants will undergo a 4- to 5-hour screening with a medical history,
           physical and neurological examination, stroke evaluation, and an anatomical magnetic
           resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. The screening visit may be done over the course of
           more than one day, if needed for patient convenience or test availability.

        -  In addition to the initial outpatient visit, subjects may remain enrolled in this study
           for up to 15 years and may be contacted to see if they qualify for new branch studies.
           Subjects may be re-examined up to once per year while they remain in this protocol to
           confirm ongoing eligibility. The re-examination visits will involve a neurologic
           evaluation and possible repeat MRI.

NCT01027637,Regenerative Tissue Matrix for Breast Reconstruction,"
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the role of Alloderm tissue regenerative matrix used
      in many breast reconstruction operations. When this material is used in the abdomen it often
      stretches and sometimes needs to be replaced. Although we see good clinical results when used
      for breast reconstruction, there is no research regarding if or how the material changes in
      this location. The Alloderm is placed in the breast at the time the expander is placed,
      post-mastectomy. The expansion is started at the time of surgery and completed during a
      series of office visit. This process stretches the skin, underlying muscle and presumably the
      Alloderm. The goal of this study is to better understand the natural history of this material
      when used for breast reconstruction.

      Our objective is to measure changes in the dimension of the tissue matrix material after it
      has been placed in the breast. These objective findings will be supplemented with a patient
      questionnaire specifically designed for breast surgery patients.

      All patients will receive the standard preoperative work up, intraoperative procedures, and
      postoperative care indicated for patients undergoing implant breast reconstruction after
      mastectomy. Some of these patients will require use of the Alloderm to reconstruct the lower
      half of the breast pocket. This is already being done by plastic surgeons here at Henry Ford
      Hospital. The difference will be that the Alloderm tissue matrix used to reconstruct the
      lower part of the breast pocket for the study patients will have 4 millimeter metallic clips
      placed in it. Postoperatively these clips will be tracked by ultrasound done in the clinic.
      As the breast implant is normally expanded by adding saline, we believe the Alloderm matrix
      will stretch. The movement of these imperceptible clips will be tracked and measured to map
      the expansion of the matrix in response to the underlying implant stretching the overlying
      breast pocket and the skin envelope. The pattern of expansion will allow us to develop a
      mathematical model to describe the stretch pattern of Alloderm matrix used in breast
      reconstruction. This information will be supplemented with a validated questionnaire
      specifically designed by breast surgery patients. This will give us both an objective
      dimensional change in the breast reconstruction as well as a patient-centered evaluation of
      the reconstruction process.

NCT01021280,Parathyroid Hormone (PTH) Homeostasis in Bartter Syndrome,"
      Parathyroid hormone (PTH) gland calcium sensing receptor (CASR) regulates PTH secretion. CASR
      is also expressed in nephron thick ascending limb (TAL). Bartter syndrome (BS), a
      normotensive hypokalemic tubulopathy, may be due to mutations in different TAL channels,
      including the potassium channel ROMK. Mutations in CASR may also cause BS through its effects
      on ROMK function. However, it is unknown whether ROMK mutations exert any effects on CASR
      function and PTH physiology. Preliminary data from our center shows that PTH levels were
      specifically elevated in type II (where ROMK is mutated) and not in type IV (where another
      gene, Barttin is defective) BS, without a common explanation. We assume that the mutation in
      ROMK may cause a dysregulation of PTH secretion via possible interaction with CASR.

      The purpose of this study is: to investigate the PT-gland function and regulation in BS.

      Methods: Patients with BS type II and IV and normal controls will undergo a standard protocol
      of controlled ionic hypo- and hypercalcemia, during which PTH secretion, phosphate balance
      and calcium excretion will be followed. Calcium Vs PTH response curves will be generated and
      compared.

      Expected impact and benefit: the results of this study will help understand the mechanisms of
      PTH regulation beyond CASR.

      The increasing intake of fructose has been associated with an increase in obesity among US
      children and adolescents, but its ""dose dependent"" effects on insulin sensitivity and lipid
      metabolism has not been studied in detail. Methods: 36 healthy male adult human subjects will
      be included in this study. They will be randomly allocated into a low, moderate or high
      fructose, a moderate or high glucose and a sucrose diet for 3 weeks. In randomized order and
      with 4 week wash out intervals each subject will receive all six different diets. Three day
      food records will be used to measure total fructose and glucose intake. During the low
      fructose diet subjects will be instructed to avoid nutrients containing fructose aiming at
      consumption of less than 1g fructose/d. During the moderate fructose diet subjects will
      receive 3x13.3g of fructose or glucose, respectively. High fructose diet subjects will
      receive either 3x26.7g/d of fructose, 3x 26.7g/d of glucose or 3x 26.7g/d of sucrose in the
      form of three daily soft drinks taken together with the three main meals.

      75 g oral glucose tolerance testing will be performed and composite insulin sensitivity index
      will be calculated The presence of phosphorylated fructose metabolites in plasma will be
      measured by targeted LC-MS/MS. In addition, metabolite biomarkers in plasma will be screened

      an euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp will be performed using [6,6- 2H2]glucose.

      Thus, the lipogenic potential of fructose in humans will be compared with isocaloric amounts
      of glucose. Particularly, the question whether lipogenic effects are continuously dose
      dependent or whether there is a lipogenic shunting and if yes, at what level of ingested
      fructose will be addressed.

      However, not all patients may respond to this treatment in the way that it is currently
      administered and the concern of possible relapse in some patients who respond to tDCS has

NCT01022229,The Safety and Efficacy of a Compound Natural Health Product in Children With Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD),"
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the use of a natural health product, as compared
      to placebo (an inactive substance), in managing the symptoms of ADHD. The natural health
      product contains the nutrients zinc, magnesium, vitamin B6 and vitamin C. Each of these
      nutrients has some evidence to suggest that children with ADHD might be lacking them. As
      such, children with ADHD might benefit from supplementing their diets with these nutrients,
      especially ADHD children who have below average levels.

      This study will measure whether the severity of ADHD symptoms is greater in children with low
      levels of zinc, magnesium, and vitamin B6, and whether the severity of ADHD symptoms will
      decrease with supplementation of these nutrients. This study will also monitor for any
      adverse reactions or side effects from taking these nutrients in children.

      Although these natural health products are commercially available, the use of them as a
      supplement or placebo in this study has been approved for use in this study by the Natural
      Health Products Directorate of Health Canada.

      Diabetes is a common and serious chronic disease. However, there is a large gap between the
      level of care that people should receive (based on research and guidelines) and the level of
      care they actually receive. With the release of their 2008 Clinical Practice Guidelines, the
      Canadian Diabetes Association has a strategy to improve heart disease screening and treatment
      for people with diabetes. This study will evaluate whether the strategy works. The focus of
      the strategy was to give all family physicians in Canada a Toolkit in June 2009 to help them
      delivery better care for their diabetic patients. In Ontario, only half of doctors received
      this Toolkit. We will compare the quality of care received by diabetic patients whose doctors

      This study is being done to better understand why people with HIV who have taken drugs for
      HIV begin to show abnormal changes in fat loss or fat gain in their bodies. This condition is
      called lipodystrophy.

      Patients who take medicine for HIV and who have lipodystrophy report loss of subcutaneous
      (sc) fat from the arms, legs, and face and excess fat gain in the neck and truncal region.
      They also more likely to have problems with insulin in the body, high fat levels in the blood
      and diabetes. The reason that lipodystrophy develops is not fully understood although some
      HIV drugs have are very likely the cause. The complications pose an increased risk of fat
      blockage forming in the arteries making you more at risk for heart problems in the future.
      Changes in body fat can cause physical discomfort and psychological distress. Management of
      these problems can be a challenge for the patient's doctor.

      The investigators propose data collection to determine if there is more than one reason why
      this might happen in some people and not in others. Laboratory samples being collected: 1)
      special imaging of the liver; 2) fat collected by needle from the mid thigh and mid-shoulder
      areas; 3) blood samples to measure the virus, t-cells, fats, and other markers of how the
      patient's body is handling the virus.

      This study is being done because science does not fully understand why some patients with HIV
      who take medicines for the virus have abnormal fat loss or gain and some do not. This
      research study is intended to help us better understand why and how this happens.

      Lower urinary tract symptoms such as urinary leakage and overactive bladder affect millions
      of American women. Women may develop these problems because the innervation of the muscles of
      the bladder and urethra are injured. Most research on treating these problems has focused on
      the abnormalities of the bladder muscle, but newer studies have shown abnormalities in the
      innervation and muscle function of the urethra.

      Women with these symptoms may benefit from treatment with medications to improve their
      urethral function. However, to truly understand what types of medications will help women
      with these symptoms, the investigators wish to study how these medications affect innervation

NCT01025427,HIV Persistence and Viral Reservoirs,"
      Although highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) decreases HIV-associated mortality, it
      does not to completely restore health. Patients doing well on otherwise effective HAART
      remain at risk for cancer, cardiovascular/liver disease, osteopenia, and other
      ""non-AIDS-defining"" events. While complete eradication may never be feasible, a ""functional
      cure"" in which patients are able to maintain undetectable viral loads indefinitely without
      therapy may be possible. The best evidence for this are the so-called ""elite"" controllers,
      whom we define as individuals who are HIV-seropositive, with plasma HIV RNA levels below the
      level of conventional detection without treatment. Controllers may be conceptualized as a
      naturally occurring model of a functional cure (or ""HIV remission""), and are ideal patients
      in which to study HIV persistence and the possibility of eradication.

      We propose to conduct a pilot study to better characterize the reservoirs that lead to viral
      persistence in a group of well-characterized controllers. We propose two specific aims: 1) to
      characterize the dynamics of viral production in blood and gut-associated lymphoid tissue
      (GALT) in controllers; and 2) to prospectively treat 10 controllers with raltegravir,
      tenofovir/emtricitabine for 24 weeks and study the effects of HAART on viral dynamics and
      host inflammatory responses.

      Our primary hypotheses are: 1) viral replication is ongoing in untreated controllers, 2)
      HAART will reduce viral replication in blood and GALT and decrease immune activation, and 3)
      higher levels of immune activation are associated with greater measures of microbial
      translocation and distribution of virus to more differentiated T cell subsets.

      Earlier studies have found that retinal photography could be very useful for evaluating the
      condition of microcirculation and the risk of cardiovascular diseases in patients. The
      architectural changes in retinal vascularisation strongly correlates with macrovascular
      remodeling. Also, recent founding suggests a possible close anatomical parallel between both
      the macrovascular and the microvascular blood.

      Our objectives are to assess (1) in which age and sex subgroups, if any, retinal vascular
      alteration in arterioles and venules can be predictive for cardiovascular morbidity and
      mortality; and (2) whether variations in arteriolar or venular caliber will predict better
      cardiovascular pathogenesis in normal and patient population. If the association between the
      diameter of the retinal vessels and the risks of cardiovascular disease is verified during
      this study, the impact on prevention would be enormous. The retinal microvascular change
      could become a powerful biomarker in the early detection of the cardiovascular pathogenesis

      The proposed study will test how well an innovative method, interactive voice response (IVR),
      can be used for delivering an treatment for chronic low back pain. The use of IVR will
      improve the accessibility of treatment to Veterans. IVR is a computerized interface that
      allows patients to use their telephone to: 1) obtain pre-recorded didactic information, 2)
      report data regarding pain-related symptoms and adherence to pain coping skill practice, and
      3) receive personalized therapist feedback. Although CBT has been shown to be effective in
      reducing pain intensity, traditional CBT requires patients to make frequent office visits.

      thereby allowing them to access treatment at their convenience without travel to the VA for
      an outpatient appointment. Veterans with chronic low back pain will be randomized in equal

NCT01024179,Relationship Between Initial Plaque Characteristics and Stent Surface Coverage Patterns,"
      Vulnerable plaque characterized by thin fibrous cap and large lipid core is an independent
      risk factor for most of acute cardiac event. Current clinical data showed that thin-cap
      fibroatheroma was more frequently observed in patients with ACS than SAP. Further OCT study
      indicated that patients with ACS had significantly higher incidence of incomplete neointimal
      coverage and malapposition after DES implantation than those with SAP. These findings imply
      that initial native lesion characteristics may be related to different vessel response
      (neointimal coverage and malapposition) after stenting. However, there is little data on the
      relationship between plaque characteristics and vascular response to DES after stent
      implantation evaluated by OCT.

      Therefore, this study was designed to investigate the relationship between initial plaque
      characteristics and stent surface coverage or late malapposition after SES implantation. The
      investigators will use high resolution OCT to assess the initial culprit plaque morphology
      and subsequent vascular response after SES stenting at the time points of post-stenting, 6

NCT01020045,Effect of HIV Infection and Highly Active Antiretroviral Treatment (HAART) on Bone Homeostasis,"
      Advances in HAART have been a huge success story in the management of HIV infection. However,
      serious metabolic complications including osteoporosis and bone fractures are increasingly
      been seen with HAART, and the responsible mechanisms remain poorly elucidated.

      The skeleton continually regenerates through homeostatic bone remodeling. Osteoclasts the
      cells responsible for bone resorption form under the influence of the key osteoclastogenic
      cytokine Receptor- Activator of NF-KB (RANKL). The osteoclastogenic and pro-resorptive
      activities of RANKL are moderated by its physiological decoy receptor osteoprotegerin (OPG).
      Increase in the ratio of RANKL to OPG accelerates the rate of osteoclastic bone resorption
      leading to osteoporosis.

      The investigators' preliminary studies have now demonstrated that in an animal model of
      HIV/AIDS, the HIV-1 Transgenic rat, the development of osteoporosis is recapitulated as
      observed in human patients. Furthermore, the investigators found that B cell expression of
      OPG is significantly downregulated, concurrent with a significant upregulation in production

      It is been known for at least 20 years that the hemodynamic data, the amount of exercise
      performed as well as symptoms on the treadmill, has significant value to the perfusion stress
      testing. When a pharmacologic stress test is performed (and adenosine stress test over 4-6
      minutes), this hemodynamic data is lost. Because of this loss of valuable data, it is felt
      that there is also a loss of significant prognostic data as well. With the advent and FDA
      release of Regadenoson in a rapid injection form (over 10 seconds), it is thought that the
      combination of both exercise stress testing and pharmacologic testing in subjects that do not

      measured by Cormack and ehane (C&L) (1 to 4, 4 the worst), without increasing the time taken
      to intubate (TTI), compared with direct laryngoscopy (DL).

      The investigators secondary hypotheses are that the use of Glidescope and Truview PCD provoke
      less hemodynamic response and fewer episodes of de-saturation in pediatric patients.

NCT01029210,Temporomandibular Disorders and Osteoporosis,"
      Increased life expectancy has attracted research attention, interested in provide a quality
      and healthy aging. According to the latest census conducted in 2010 by IBGE, Brazilian
      population consists of 97,342,162 women, whom estimates 30 million are between 40 and 65
      years old, a period that includes the climacteric. Therefore, clinical conditions such as
      osteoporosis becomes significant, either from public health policy standpoint or in relation
      to the social aspect, by compromising life quality. Women also suffer more from
      temporomandibular disorders (TMD) than men, and the beginning of this situation occurs after
      puberty, with peaks during the reproductive and remission periods after menopause. Female sex
      hormones involvement in osteoporosis is well established, but their participation in the TMD
      is still controversial. Thus, this study aims to investigate the role of systemic bone mass
      in menopausal women as a risk factor for articular TMD, as well as the TMD pain behavior
      during menopause transition periods (48 to 55 years), postmenopausal (56-65 years) and
      senescence (65-70 years). Therefore, 100 women attended by the HC - FMUSP Gynecology
      Division, Climacteric Sector, were clinically evaluated by the Research Diagnostic Criteria
      for Temporomandibular Disorders (RDC/TMD), used to obtain diagnoses and their associations,
      as well as to quantify the TMD pain sensitivity degree through the Craniomandibular Index
      (CMI), both applied by a single examiner. The bone densitometry provided bone mass data of
      femoral neck and lumbar spine (L1-L4). The RDC/TMD performance as a diagnostic test also was
      subjected to analysis, considering the 3.0 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging as reference
      standard, undergoing 30 women, of 100 assessed, in this imaging exam. After analyzing the
      results, it was shown that the risk posed by osteopenia was 1.33 (IC95% 1.20 - 1.46), with a
      risk increase of 0.33, while the risk of osteoporosis showed 1.39 (IC95% 1,20 - 1.23 to
      1.55), increased by 0.39. Joint diagnoses predominated (68.0%), while 18.0% muscular
      diagnoses and 14.0% corresponds to the absence of clinically diagnosable conditions,
      according to the RDC/TMD. The performance of the RDC/TMD to diagnose articular DTM revealed
      accuracy of 68.0%, sensitivity of 83.0%, specificity 53.0%, pre-test probability of 52.0%,
      positive predictive value of 60.0 % and negative 74.0%, positive likelihood ratio of 1.77 and
      negative 0.32. As for the soreness sensibility in TMD, it was found that aging shows a clear
      tendency towards its reduction (A =- 4.5, p = 0.0324). Then, the study concluded that the
      decrease in female sex hormones, peculiar to aging, increases the risk of articular TMD,
      although this pain disfunction decreases with age. The RDC/TMD can be used for large
      populations screening, but its indication in clinical practice should be done with caution.

      The aim of this project is to study the relationship between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)
      and metabolic syndrome (MS) in a population of obese patients who are candidates for
      bariatric surgery. The investigators will study the influence of OSA through hypoxia and
      sleep fragmentation on different proinflammatory adipokines and cytokines, on metabolic
      syndrome and on insulin resistance, as well as how these respond to treatment with continuous
      positive airway pressure (CPAP).

      In the first part of the study (part A) the investigators will perform an observational study
      of cases and controls. Based on the diagnostic polysomnography the patients will be divided
      into two groups depending on their apnea-hypopnea index (AHI): OSA (AHI >= 15/h) and non-OSA
      (AHI <15/h). The results will be analyzed depending on the presence or not of OSA.

      In the second part of the study (part B), the patients with severe OSA (AHI ≥ 30/h) will be
      randomized into two groups: one group will receive CPAP + diet treatment and the other group
      will only receive diet treatment. After 3 months of treatment (CPAP + diet vs. diet), the
      investigators will analyze the overall effect on metabolic syndrome and the effect on its
      individual components, as well as the above-mentioned inflammatory pathways and insulin
      sensitivity, between the 2 groups. This will be carried out through a randomized controlled
      study in which the investigators will compare the effect of CPAP with the effect of

NCT01022944,Prevalence of Mucosal Biofilm Formations in Adenoidectomy Specimens,"
      Rationale: Bacterial biofilms are defined as an assemblage of bacterial cells enclosed in a
      self-produced glycocalyx matrix. Adherence on surfaces, and resistance to both antibiotic
      treatments and host defenses are ones of the major clinical features of bacterial biofilms.
      Hence, biofilm formations represent a serious clinical problem: they persist in human tissues
      and play a role in a large number of chronic and resistant infections. It has been estimated
      that more than 65% of all human bacterial infections involve biofilms. Recently, the
      investigators have demonstrated the presence of mucosal bacterial biofilms in adenoid tissues
      removed during routine adenoidectomy. Bacterial biofilms were visualized using Confocal Laser
      Scanning Microscopy (CLSM) with a technique of double staining showing both the bacterial
      cells and the glycocalyx matrix. Although this study clearly established that adenoids
      tissues can harbour mucosal biofilms, the prevalence of 54% the investigators found suggested
      that some groups of children may contain more biofilm formations than others. In an effort to
      relate the findings of mucosal biofilm with the clinical presentation, the investigators have
      designed the present work to compare the prevalence of mucosal biofilms in adenoidectomy
      specimens in two groups: one group of children with chronic otitis media (COM) with effusion
      versus another group of children without any COM, having adenoids removed for chronic
      obstruction.

NCT01022489,High Frequency Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) in Schizophrenia : a Randomized Controlled Study,"
      Background:

      Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a recent therapeutic which has
      demonstrated its efficacy in the treatment of auditory hallucinations in patients with
      schizophrenic disorders. Up to now, the target of stimulation has been over the left
      temporoparietal region (based on the international 10-20 EEG system) and rTMS has been
      delivered at low frequency (1 Hz).

      High frequency (20 Hz) might allow shortening the duration of treatment and so could be more
      convenient for the patient (2 days at high frequency instead of 15 days at low frequency).

      Besides high frequency, an accurate target taking into account the inter-subjects anatomical
      variability might increase the efficacy. Based on a great overlap of language and auditory
      hallucinations networks, the investigators hypothesized that targeting the stimulation on the
      highest cluster of activation induced by a language task could be an easier and relevant
      method to determine the target. The investigators suggest that the best area is located at
      the posterior part of the left superior temporal sulcus (STS). Indeed, this area is
      considered as an "" epicenter "" of language, i.e., involved both in understanding and
      production of language and in the auditory hallucination network. Therefore, the
      investigators conducted an open pilot study in order to test the interest of rTMS at high
      frequency (20 Hz) associated with anatomical and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      and neuronavigation in 11 schizophrenic patients with hallucinations. The investigators
      showed a significant reduction of auditory hallucinations; Seven out of 11 patients (63.8%)
      were considered as responders at day 12 with a decrease of more than 30% of the score of
      Hoffman's scale (Auditory Hallucinations Rating Scale) ; 2 patients presented a drastic
      improvement with no hallucinations after 12 days of rTMS. The investigators also showed the
      target based on anatomical and functional MRI was located at the intersection of the left STS
      and the coronal slice across the vertical line of sylvius sulcus.

      The aim of this multicentric double-blind study (randomized and placebo sham) is to
      demonstrate the efficacy of rTMS at high frequency with neuronavigation in the treatment of
      auditory hallucinations in patients with schizophrenia and schizo-affective disorders
      (DSMIV-R).

      Methods:

      72 subjects will be included after written consent. After randomization, the subject will
      receive in a double blind either active treatment or placebo (sham coil) treatment.

      rTMS : 4 sessions of 13 minutes, with 2 sessions a day, at 20Hz frequency and at an intensity
      of 80% of rest motor threshold will be delivered. These parameters allow the investigators to
      be under the risk of epilepsia, the only one severe side effect. Another mild side effect is
      headache easily treated by antalgic drugs. The target will be established with anatomical MRI
      eventually associated with functional MRI before treatment.

      The efficacy of treatment will be evaluated over 4 weeks (D0, D1, D2, D7, D14, D21 and D30).
      The primary assessment is the percentage of patients who present a decrease of more than 30%
      of the frequency item of Auditory Hallucinations Rating Scale (AHRS) between D1 and D30 at 2
      evaluations spaced of 1 week (Responder patients). The secondary assessments are : 1-
      Relative decrease of frequency item of AHRS between D1 and D14 ; 2- Evolution of total score
      of AHRS at D1, D2, D7, D14, D21 and D30 ; 3- Variation of scores of CGI, SUMD, IS, positive,
      negative, general and total PANSS scores between D0 and D14 and D30 ; 4- Scores at secondary
      side effects (adapted UKU) at D2 and D7; 5- Distances between the present target and the
      classical target based on 10-20 EEG system (T3P3) and/or the target established with
      functional MRI (cluster of activations induced by a listening comprehension task).

NCT01028846,Central Mechanisms That Regulate Glucose Metabolism in Humans,"
      Type 2 diabetes is a chronic condition that affects the ability of the body to regulate
      glucose (sugar). When glucose levels are low, the liver can make glucose to increase levels
      in the body. This important process is called endogenous glucose production (EGP). Previous
      studies suggest that the central nervous system (CNS), including the brain, helps to
      coordinate this process by communicating with the liver through potassium channels. Control
      of EGP can be impaired in people with type 2 diabetes, which may contribute to the high
      levels of glucose seen in these individuals.

      The purpose of this study is to understand how activating these potassium channels in the
      control centers of the brain with a medication called diazoxide might inhibit the amount of
      glucose made by the liver. This is particularly important for people with diabetes who have
      very high production of glucose, which in turn causes hyperglycemia (high levels of sugar in
      the blood) that leads to diabetes complications.

NCT01021098,Acute Respiratory Infection Consortium,"
      Recently, the emergence and rapid global dissemination of novel swine-origin influenza A
      virus (H1N1) with unique epidemiologic characteristics has heightened awareness and concern
      of this viral pathogen, and its potential for major disruption of both civil and military
      stability. Although advances in medical and scientific technologies have improved our basic
      understanding of respiratory disease, many questions about the epidemiology and immunology of
      ARI remain unanswered. This study plans to initiate a multi-site, multi-disciplinary research
      collaboration, termed the Acute Respiratory Infection Consortium (ARIC) for the purpose of
      studying the etiology, epidemiology and immunology of influenza-like illness (ILI) in order
      to describe the natural history and risk factors for disease, as well as the characteristics
      of the host immune response.

      At the core of the ARIC is the proposed observational, longitudinal study of the Natural
      History Study of ILI among active duty military members, healthy retirees, and their
      dependents recruited from both inpatient and outpatient settings of military treatment
      facilities (MTF) in the continental US to be followed for a total of four (4) visits over a
      28-day period. Additionally, the investigators also propose to conduct a household-based
      study of influenza (Family Transmission Study) in which individuals who have a
      laboratory-confirmed influenza illness will be recruited and enrolled along with their family
      members for the purpose of studying transmission of influenza within households. Taken
      together, these studies will establish a longitudinal cohort of ILI among active duty members
      and their families, as well as a repository of biological specimens relevant to the
      epidemiology and immunology of infection. Ultimately, these studies will serve as a solid

NCT01025362,Baby-Friendly Community Health Services Evaluation,"
      The Norwegian Action Plan on Nutrition aim at increasing the prevalence of breastfeeding. The
      initiative ""Baby-Friendly Community Health Services (BFCHS)"" is an initiative to reach this
      goal. BFCHS is developed from the concept ""The Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative"" by
      WHO/UNICEF, and the intention is to increase the quality of breastfeeding counseling at
      Norwegian well-baby clinics.

      The purpose of the study

      The study seeks to answer the following research questions:

        -  What effect does the process of being certified as a BFCHS have on the proportion of
           mothers who exclusively breastfeed their children for 5 months?

        -  What effect does the process of being certified as a BFCHS have on the proportion of
           mothers who exclusively breastfeed for 4 months?

        -  What effect does the certification process have on the proportion of mothers who
           breastfeed at 11 months of age?

        -  What effect does the certification process have on the differences in breastfeeding due
           to social inequality?

        -  What effect does the certification process have on the mothers impression of the quality
           of the well-baby clinics lactation counseling?

        -  What effect does the certification process have on mothers satisfaction with the
           breastfeeding experience?

        -  What effect does the certification process have on perceived pressure to breastfeed?
           Methods Cluster randomized controlled study Sampling The survey unit, cluster, will be
           the community health services. All community health services in six counties in Norway
           will be invited to participate.

      Inclusion criteria: Norwegian speaking mothers who have 5 month and 11 month old children.

      Data collection Respondents are identified through the National Population Register (DSF).
      The data collection takes place using a postal questionnaire.

      Baseline: Data collection before the intervention is implemented to assess breastfeeding
      prevalence and distribution of covariates in the two study arms.

      Post-survey: The post-survey to assess the effect, will take place about two years after
      baseline when the community health services have been certified.

      Sample size It is expected that the project could increase the breastfeeding prevalence with
      5 percentage points. This assumption is the basis for the sample size. The initial aim is to
      recruit about 50 well-baby clinics.

      RATIONALE: Giving chemotherapy before a donor bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell
      transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It also helps stop the patient's immune
      system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. When the healthy stem cells from a donor are
      infused into the patient they may help the patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red blood
      cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can
      make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving cyclosporine and methotrexate
      before and after transplant may stop this from happening.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well donor stem cell transplant or bone marrow

NCT01027481,Ranibizumab in Patients With Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion,"
      In a recent study we could show that the early retinal venous vasoconstriction after grid
      photocoagulation in branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) is closely correlated to the visual
      outcome after three months. This could be of clinical importance, because the degree of
      vasoconstriction might be an early marker of treatment success, compatible with the idea that
      hypoxia is the major trigger of VEGF in BRVO. The present study evaluates the response of
      retinal vessel diameters to anti VEGF treatment with lucentis in patients with BRVO. This is
      done in an effort to gain insight into the retinal hemodynamic consequences of anti VEGF
      treatment in BRVO. The hypothesis that anti VEGF treatment is associated with a

NCT01023607,Evaluation of Statin-induced Lipid-rich Plaque Progression by Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) Combined With Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS),"
      Many trials suggested that lipid lowering therapy could significantly reduce cardiovascular
      events. Enhancing stability of vulnerable plaque is probably the main reason by which statins
      reduce adverse coronary events. The size of lipid core and the fibrous cap thickness (FCT)
      are the major determinants of plaque vulnerability. So, it is very important to accurately
      evaluate changes in plaque after stains therapy.

      Previous reports suggested that intensive lipid lowering therapy provide more significantly
      clinical benefit compared with moderate lipid lowering therapy.Such benefit may contribute to
      the changes in following parameters: FCT, lipid arc(quadrants), TCFA, macrophage, plaque
      disruption, and thrombus measured by OCT, and plaque burden and remodeling index by IVUS.

      Current intravascular imaging modalities, such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) and
      intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) can provide in vivo quantitative and qualitative information
      of coronary plaques. However, there were few studies aimed at monitoring the progression of
      coronary plaques in patients receiving statin therapy by OCT combined with IVUS.

      Therefore, the study we designed were to compare the effect of the rosuvastatin 10mg,
      atorvastatin 20mg and atorvastatin 60mg treatment on the changes in FCT and lipid core arc by
      OCT and plaque burden by IVUS of coronary atherosclerotic plaques.

NCT01028300,Clinical Outcomes of Lumbar Degenerative Disc Disease in Active-Duty U.S. Service Personnel,"
      Degenerative disc disease (DDD) refers to a syndrome in which a degenerating disc causes
      chronic back pain, significantly impacting an individual's ability to function. The condition
      is most commonly diagnosed in the lumbosacral spinal segments L3-S1. The condition often
      starts with an injury to the disc space. The injury weakens the disc and creates excessive
      motion at the corresponding vertebral level. Over time, the segmental instability and
      associated neurological compromise combined with ongoing inflammatory processes that occur in
      and around the disc produce low back pain. The reparative processes in the disc are poor,
      thus the painful symptoms can become chronic.

      Premature degeneration at adjacent levels of the spine remains one of the more vexing
      problems facing spinal surgeons when advising relatively young people to consider lumbar
      fusion surgery. Stopping the motion changes the mechanics of the back (which is designed for
      motion and flexibility) and results in the transfer of the loads and stresses to the adjacent
      vertebral segments. It is therefore intuitive to pursue total disc replacement, which allows
      for the treatment of pain due to DDD while re-establishing motion and stability, load
      distribution, and restoring the disc height, as an alternative to spinal fusion surgery.

      The study hypothesis is that military personnel receiving Total Disc Replacement will return
      to the same level of active duty performance as at the time of their most recent successful
      physical readiness test.

NCT01028417,Study to See if Microcoil Insertion Reduces the Rate of Open Thoracotomy for Removal of Lung Nodules,"
      LAY ABSTRACT

        1. Statement of the health problem or issue: Of the estimated 24,000 Canadians who will be
           diagnosed with lung cancer in 2008, 21,000 will die of their disease. Based on this
           cancer incidence and survival data, the most promising current strategy for improving
           outcome is screening and early detection. It is suggested that if lesions are discovered
           at an earlier stage of disease, they will have a higher likelihood of being treatable
           and therefore, survival will be improved. CT detection of growing small lung nodules,
           many of which are non-cancerous (benign), raises the possibility of lung cancer and thus
           causes anxiety in patients and referring clinicians. Unfortunately, confident separation
           of benign from malignant small lung nodules cannot be reliably achieved using CT or PET
           criteria. Pathologic diagnosis using needle or excision biopsy is usually required.

           Excision biopsy removes the entire nodule at one setting and eliminates the sampling
           error associated with needle biopsy, making it appealing to physicians and patients. To
           reduce post-operative pain and breathing difficulties, excision biopsy is often
           performed using minimally invasive surgery (video assisted thoracoscopic surgery, VATS).
           Finding small pulmonary nodules is often difficult with the minimally invasive camera
           (VATS) and a bigger incision (thoracotomy) is necessary in more than 60% of our
           patients.

           We recently developed a technique of using platinum micro-coils, which are inserted in
           the lung nodule using CT guidance, to locate the nodule with fluoroscopy and then excise
           it with VATS. We have completed a pilot study (n=75 nodules; 69 patients) to determine
           the effectiveness of this technique. Seventy three (97%) 4-24-mm nodules were
           successfully removed at fluoroscopically guided VATS excision.

        2. Objective of your project: To improve our ability to successfully excise small growing
           lung nodules with minimally invasive VATS surgery using CT guided micro-coil
           localization techniques.

        3. How will you undertake your work? We propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial to
           determine if the use of CT guided platinum microcoil markers for VATS excision of
           subcentimetre pulmonary nodules can reduce the rate of conversion to open thoracotomy
           from 50% to 10%.

        4. What is unique/innovative about your project? New image guided minimally invasive
           surgical technique for removing early growing cancers was developed at the Vancouver
           General Hospital and the University of British Columbia. This has been published in
           peer-reviewed journals and can potentially allow us to accurately locate and excise
           suspicious lung nodules

        5. Relevance to Lung Association's mission statement? Lung cancer remains a major health
           problem in Canada. Early detection and screening programs allow for discovery of nodules
           when they are still very small and therefore, likely curable. Excision biopsy removes
           the entire nodule at one setting and eliminates the sampling error associated with
           needle biopsy, making it appealing to patients and physicians. To reduce post operative
           morbidity, costs and volume of lung removed, excision biopsy is often performed using
           video assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) techniques. Using a pilot project grant from
           the BC Lung Association we have developed a new technique that allows preoperative CT
           marking of the nodule and minimally invasive removal of the lesion. We hope that this
           technique will allow earlier treatment of lung cancers and improve survival in this
           devastating disease.

NCT01020851,The PREVENTS Trial: The Preventing Recurrent Events in Veterans Navigating Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) or Stroke Trial,"
      National recommendations state that patients with a history of transient ischemic attack
      (TIA) or ischemic stroke should receive hypertension treatment, including antihypertensive
      medication and lifestyle modification, with a goal of reducing blood pressure (BP) to <120 mm
      Hg systolic BP and <80 mm Hg diastolic BP. Statin treatment and lifestyle modification is
      also recommended for post-stroke and post-TIA patients with elevated cholesterol levels or a
      history of stroke or TIA with an atherosclerotic cause. Despite the clear benefits of
      secondary stroke prevention, there is a gap between evidence and implementation in clinical
      practice. By a randomized controlled trial, the investigators will test whether a tailored,
      telephone-delivered transtheoretical model-based behavioral intervention will improve
      adherence to treatment in veterans with a history of TIA or stroke, thereby leading to better
      control of BP and cholesterol levels, as compared to an attention placebo.

      The primary specific aims of this project are to:

        -  determine whether a behaviorally tailored intervention (TI) can effectively lower BP
           after 6 months of counseling as compared to an attention placebo (AP) in veterans with a
           history of stroke or TIA

        -  assess whether the TI is effective in improving adherence to diet after 6 months of
           counseling in veterans with a history of stroke or TIA.

      Secondary aims are to

        -  assess whether the TI is effective in improving cholesterol levels in post-stroke
           veterans after 6 months

        -  evaluate whether the TI is effective in improving adherence to antihypertensive and
           lipid-lowering medications after 6 months of counseling in veterans with a history of
           stroke or TIA

        -  determine whether the TI is effective in improving adherence to exercise recommendations
           after 6 months.

      To answer this, veterans (n=190) with a history of stroke or TIA will be randomized equally
      to the TI, which will use the transtheoretical framework to provide 6 monthly counseling
      phone sessions about adherence to diet, medication, and exercise recommendations, and the AP,

NCT01027455,Warm Humid Gas Insufflation for Appendix Removal by Minimally Invasive Surgery Warm Humid Insufflation for Appendix Removal by Minimally Invasive Surgery Trial (WARMIST),"
      In laparoscopic (key-hole) surgery, the use of cold dry carbon dioxide gas to inflate the
      abdominal cavity for the creation a clear operating field, results in damage to the cavity
      lining, known as the peritoneum. This has been associated with negative effects on
      post-operative recovery. Adult studies using warm humidified insufflation gas have indicated
      possible decreased post-operative pain, reduced narcotic analgesia requirements, decreased
      fogging of the laparoscopic camera lens, and reduced time to return to normal activities.
      Cold dry gas during laparoscopic surgery also has potential to cause abnormal decrease in
      body core temperature (hypothermia). This has been established by trials in adult humans and
      animal models. The WARMIST study aims to investigate for whether warm humid gas insuflation
      during laparoscopic removal of the appendix in children reduces intraoperative temperature
      variations, post-operative pain (indicated by morphine usage and pain scores), length of
      hospital stay and degree of camera lens fogging, and speed post-operative recovery compared
      to using cold dry gas insufflation.

      Background:

        -  Recombinant human interleukin-15 (rhIL-15) is a substance that is naturally produced in
           the body that has many properties that increase the activity and strength of the immune
           system, the body s natural defense system. It is hoped that rhIL-15 can boost or
           strengthen patients immune systems and restore immune responses against cancer and
           infectious diseases like HIV.

        -  rhIL-15 is being studied in patients with malignant melanoma, an aggressive type of skin
           cancer, and in patients with renal cell carcinoma, a type of kidney cancer that has
           spread to other parts of the body. Researchers are interested in determining if rhIL-15
           can help stimulate the immune system and aid in the treatment process for cancers that
           have not responded well to standard therapies.

      Objectives:

        -  To determine whether rhIL-15 is safe and effective in the treatment of metastatic
           malignant melanoma or metastatic renal cell carcinoma

        -  To examine how the body processes rhIL-15 after each infusion and determine how it acts
           on the treated cancer.

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients older than 18 years of age that have been diagnosed with metastatic malignant
           melanoma or metastatic renal cell carcinoma that has not responded to standard
           treatments.

        -  Eligible patients may not have received prior treatment with interleukin-2.

      Design:

        -  Prior to treatment, patients will have baseline blood tests and imaging scans.

        -  Participants will be admitted to an in-patient unit of the NIH Clinical Center for this
           treatment. rhIL-15 will be given intravenously once a day for 12 consecutive days, for a
           total of twelve doses of the drug. The injection of rhIL-15 will take about 30 minutes.
           Patients will be evaluated daily before each treatment and more frequently if necessary.

        -  During the 12-day treatment and for at least 42 days from the start of the treatment,
           patients will be closely followed for possible side effects and for tumor response.
           Blood will be drawn frequently for monitoring purposes, and other procedures such as
           chest x-rays and imaging scans will be performed to monitor the state of the tumor and
           the patient response to treatment.

        -  After completing the rhIL-15 treatment and discharge from the hospital, patients will
           have an evaluation with a member of the research team once a week from the end of the
           treatment period to 42 days from the start of the treatment.

        -  Study doctors may ask patients to return for evaluation (including blood draws) at 3 and
           6 months after the completion of the treatment, checking for potential long-term effects
           or toxicity of the treatment.

      to Hegar number 10, complications during cervical dilation and the hysteroscopy, and
      misoprostol associated side effects. The cervical width was assessed by performing cervical
      dilatation, starting with a number 10 Hegar dilator and subsequently inserting smaller Hegar
      dilatators until the dilator could pass through the internal os without resistance. The
      largest one that could be passed was recorded as the initial cervical width.

      The mean cervical diameter, after oral and vaginal misoprostol of 400 μg, has been reported
      to be 6.0 ± 1.5 mm and 7.3 ± 1.6 mm, respectively 4. The investigators hypothesized that
      equivalence was of clinical significance if the difference in the initial cervical width was
      less than 1 mm among groups with the standard deviation of the initial cervical width of 1.6
      mm. The estimated sample size was 47 patients in each group; this would be able to detect an
      equivalent effect in the groups with a power of 80% and a type 1 error (a) of 0.017. Data are
      expressed as the mean ± SD (standard deviation) or median with range or as the number (%) of
      cases.

      The best time of the umbilical cord clamping has not been fully understood. immediate cord
      clamping (with in 10 seconds after birth) has been standardized practice for many years,
      while WHO protocol recommends to wait for 60-90 seconds. but the umbilical cord may still
      pulse for more than 90 seconds. is it best to wait longer until the pulsing ceased? how the
      time of umbilical cord will affect the newborn? will the longer time be less umbilical
      bleeding and shorter departure time of the cord? the hypothesis of this study is: to cut the
      cord after the pulsing ceased is the best time for cord clamping and will result in better
      quality of life for the newborn and less cord bleeding and earlier departure time of the
      cord, that means less infections of the cord.

NCT01034085,Effects of Nicotine on Areas of Impaired and Preserved Functioning in Schizophrenia,"
      Background:

        -  Some people with schizophrenia have problems with their working memory and paying
           attention for extended periods. These difficulties cannot be treated with antipsychotic
           medications or with many standard therapies.

        -  The prevalence of cigarette smoking among individuals with schizophrenia is about three
           times higher than in the general population. Research has shown that nicotine, the
           addictive component found in cigarettes, can help improve attentional and working memory
           performance. Researchers are interested in learning more about whether there may be an
           overlap in the cognitive functions beneficially affected by nicotine and areas of
           dysfunction in individuals with schizophrenia.

      Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the potential of transdermal nicotine to alleviate cognitive deficits in
           schizophrenia, and to determine whether naturally maintained cigarette-smoking, in
           comparison, is an effective self-medication.

        -  To gather preliminary data on genetics that may account for individual and group
           differences in the performance effects of nicotine.

      Eligibility:

      - Current smokers (25 or more cigarettes per week for at least 1 year) between 18 and 55
      years of age who are either healthy volunteers or have been diagnosed with
      schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder.

      Design:

        -  The study will require five visits to the research center, with an initial screening
           visit, a training session, and three test sessions. Ideally, all visits will occur 1
           week apart.

        -  Training session: Participants will receive training on the types of computerized
           cognitive and attentional behavior tests that will be given during the active portion of
           the study. Participants will also fill out questionnaires on nicotine use and other
           alcohol and drug use.

        -  Test sessions: Participants will be assigned to random groups and will complete tests
           that assess cognitive performance (a) while maintaining their usual smoking behavior,
           (b) after minimal deprivation (3.5 hours without smoking) while wearing a placebo patch,
           and (c) under the influence of a standard nicotine patch. The order of these sessions
           will be different for individual participants.

NCT01035281,Efficacy Study of Nabilone in the Treatment of Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathic Pain,"
      Neuropathic pain occurs as a result of damage or disease of the peripheral or central nervous
      system. Regardless of its cause, neuropathic pain (NeP) leads to a characteristic clinical
      picture characterized by ongoing pain with steady or dysesthetic pain, such as burning or
      aching, and paroxysmal pain such as shooting or stabbing. In conditions such as diabetic
      neuropathy, changes in the membrane-bound proteins that form ion channels may alter the
      electrical properties of the injured neuron, called remodeling. The net effect of membrane
      remodeling is greater excitability of neurons, leading to a tendency towards action potential
      generation and propagation in injured primary sensory neurons which occurs in the context of
      nerve injury and disease. Over the past decade, a new endogenous cannabinoid
      receptor-mediated system within the nervous system and upon immune-mediated cells has been
      described. The cannabinoid receptor system consists of two receptors, CB1 and CB2 receptors,
      as well as endogenously produced endocannabinoids which agonize these receptors.

      This is a multicenter trial amongst Western Canadian sites to compare the efficacy of
      nabilone versus placebo in treating patients with chronic neuropathic pain (NeP) due to
      diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN).

      A one-week screening period will occur, during which pain scores and sleep scores will be
      tabulated. Following screening, a 4-week period of single blind treatment with flexible
      dosing of nabilone at 0.5 - 4 mg/day will initiate. All subjects will begin with nabilone
      therapy of 1 mg daily for a minimum of 4 days, with the dose of the study medication assessed
      and adjusted either upwards or downwards as needed to balance efficacy for pain control with
      tolerability of possible side effects. All subjects who experience at least a 30% reduction
      in their weekly mean pain score during the single blind flexible dosing phase will be
      considered a responder, and will be further continued in the study. During the double-blind
      portion of the study, subjects randomized to nabilone will continue on the dose of nabilone
      achieved at the completion of the single-blind phase, and this dose will be maintained
      throughout the double-blind phase. Subjects randomized to placebo will receive 1 mg of
      nabilone daily for one week, followed by 4 consecutive weeks of placebo. This dose of
      nabilone will permit a tapering for those subjects achieving a higher daily dose of nabilone
      during the single-blind phase, or will maintain those who were taking only 1 mg per day in
      the single-blind phase, preventing an abrupt termination of treatment in subjects who are
      randomized into the placebo portion of the study.

      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of lenalidomide when given after
      combination chemotherapy with or without rituximab and stem cell transplant and to see how
      well it works in treating patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma that has not responded to
      treatment or has returned after a period of improvement and is resistant to chemotherapy.
      Biological therapies, such as lenalidomide, may stimulate the immune system in different ways
      and stop cancer cells from growing. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carmustine,
      etoposide, cytarabine, and melphalan, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer
      cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies,
      such as rituximab, may block cancer growth by targeting certain cells. Giving lenalidomide
      after combination chemotherapy with or without rituximab may work better in treating patients
      with non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

NCT01035528,Can Insulin Glargine Improve Myocardial Function in Patients With T2D and Coronary Artery Disease (CAD),"
      The field of secondary prevention remains an extremely important goal for diagnostic and
      therapeutic approaches keeping in mind that 40% of all patients with acute myocardial
      infarction have prediabetes, commonly as impaired glucose tolerance, which has not been known
      and treated and for which there are no guidelines for treatment. In this context,
      accumulating evidence shows beneficial effects for treating diabetes mellitus early in the
      course of disease, whereas other evidence shows that aggressive antidiabetic therapy may be
      associated with undesired risks. Accordingly, the present randomized and controlled pilot
      study is designed as hypothesis creating study to create first data about potential
      medication in early type 2 diabetes including impaired glucose tolerance of patients with
      known coronary artery disease as means of secondary prevention by comparing oral antidiabetic
      therapy with metformin with insulin glargine o.d. and by studying the respective effects on
      cardiovascular function and metabolism both in the fasting state and after a standardized
      meal. As diastolic myocardial function has emerged as important prognosticator, the
      hypothesis was tested that treatment with insulin glargine improves myocardial function in
      patients with coronary artery disease and newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes including impaired

      There is no curative therapy once acute leukemia patients relapse after transplant. Patients
      who develop clinically significant graft versus host disease (GVHD) have a lower rate of
      relapse than those who do not develop GVHD. We are initiating this study of post-transplant
      fast withdrawal of immunosuppression and donor lymphocyte infusions, with a goal of achieving
      full donor chimerism in children with hematologic malignancies. If our hypothesis that full
      donor chimerism results in leukemia-free survival is correct, using immune modulation to
      achieve full donor chimerism should decrease relapse rate and thus increase survival. The
      goal of this Phase II study is to identify if achieving full donor chimerism in whole blood
      CD3+ and leukemia-specific (CD14/15+, CD19+, CD33+ and CD34+) subset may decrease the risk of

NCT01036126,Automatic Versus Evaluative Components of Cue Reactivity,"
      Background:

      - Relapse to drug abuse often happens in the presence of stimuli that are associated with
      previous drug use, also known as cues. Drug-taking behavior appears to be partly controlled
      by such cues. Some research suggests that cue-induced craving states are responsible for drug
      use and relapse, but other research suggests that cues can control drug taking without
      conscious craving or even awareness. Researchers are interested in using functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (fMRI) to study how individuals respond to drug-related cues and how these
      cues affect craving on a conscious or unconscious level.

      Objectives:

      - To determine how drug-related stimuli (cues) affect thinking, information processing, and
      body reactions in current drug users.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals between 18 and 50 years of age who are dependent on either tobacco or
      crack-cocaine, or are healthy volunteers who are not dependent on either drug.

      Design:

        -  The study will require two sessions, a training session and a testing session, that will
           take place within 48 hours of each other. Between the two test sessions, participants
           may not consume alcohol, tobacco, or illegal drugs, and must restrict caffeine
           consumption.

        -  During the first session, participants will complete questionnaires about
           tobacco/cocaine use and craving, and will be trained on the tasks to be performed in the
           MRI scanner.

        -  During the second session, participants will perform concentration tasks and look at
           pictures, some of which will be tobacco/cocaine related. Body reactions such as heart
           rate, pupil dilation, and sweating will be measured during this session. Some
           participants will have actual MRI scanning, while others will have mock MRI scanning.

      Background:

      - Eye tracking, the ability to focus on and follow a moving target with the eyes, is often
      difficult for people who have schizophrenia. Research has shown that first-degree relatives
      of people with schizophrenia, such as parents and siblings, also tend to have difficulty with
      smooth eye movement and eye tracking. Researchers are interested in using functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (fMRI) to study brain activity during eye tracking tests in order to better
      understand the effect that schizophrenia has on brain function.

      Objectives:

      - To study eye-tracking and eye-tracking impairments in people with and without
      schizophrenia.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals between 18 and 62 years of age in one of three groups: (1) patients who have
      been diagnosed with schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder, (2) first-degree relatives of
      patients in group 1, and (3) healthy volunteers with no family history of psychosis.

      Design:

        -  The study will involve two visits, one screening session and one testing session. Each
           session will take about 3 hours.

        -  Participants will be asked to avoid consuming alcohol and restrict consumption of
           caffeine before the start of the study. Participants will provide urine and breath
           samples to be tested for chemicals that may interfere with the study.

        -  Participants will visit the clinical center the morning of the day before the scanning
           session to provide blood and urine samples as required. Participants will return and be
           admitted for an overnight stay later that afternoon or evening.

        -  During the screening session, participants will provide a medical and psychological
           history, provide blood samples, and learn the eye movement tasks they will do during the
           scanning session.

        -  During the scanning session, participants will have an fMRI scan. During the scan, they
           will perform eye movement tasks that involve following moving light targets on a screen,
           and will also perform other tasks that test the ability to think and pay attention.

      Background:

      - Functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques have allowed
      researchers to map and study how the brain works when at rest and when engaged in specific
      tasks. MRI scans have provided more information about how drugs affect the brain, and about
      how drug addiction changes the brain and influences behavior, mood, and thinking processes.

      use in brain imaging studies related to addiction.

      Eligibility:

        -  Individuals between 18 and 55 years of age.

        -  Participants may be smokers or nonsmokers, and may use drugs or not use drugs.

      Design:

        -  During the initial screening, participants will complete questionnaires about family and
           personal history, drug use, and other information as required by the researchers.
           Participants who will be asked to complete tasks during the MRI scan will be shown how
           to perform these tasks before the scanning session.

        -  Before each study session, participants may be asked to complete some or all of the
           following: questions about their drug use during the last week, a breathalyzer test, a
           urine drug-use assessment, a urine pregnancy test, or a measure of carbon monoxide.
           Participants will also provide blood samples before the start of the scan.

        -  For each scanning session, participants will have an MRI scan that will last
           approximately 2 hours.

        -  MRI scans may include injections with a contrast agent to study brain function, specific
           tasks to be performed during the scan, or an experiment that studies the brain's

NCT01037361,Cerebral Activity Related to Primary Motor Stereotypies in Children: An EEG Study.,"
      Background:

        -  Motor stereotypies are a movement disorder characterized by involuntary, repetitive, and
           rhythmic movements. These movements have a predictable pattern and seem purposeful, but
           they serve no obvious function, tend to be prolonged, and can be suppressed. Common
           examples of motor stereotypies include hand waving, head nodding, and body rocking.

        -  Researchers are interested in learning more about motor stereotypies. Many children with
           autism and other developmental disorders tend to exhibit these behaviors, but normal
           healthy children and even some adults have demonstrated motor stereotypies under certain
           conditions (including boredom and stress). More research is needed to determine the
           internal causes of and potential successful treatments for these behaviors.

      Objectives:

      - To use electroencephalography (EEG) to study cerebral activity related to stereotypies in
      children.

      Eligibility:

      - Children between 7 and 18 years of age who demonstrate stereotypy movements on a consistent
      basis (at least 10 times a day for at least 4 months).

      Design:

        -  The study will require two visits to the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center.

        -  First visit: Outpatient screening visit to determine the child s eligibility for the
           study, including questionnaires for parents/guardians and a medical assessment of the
           stereotypies.

        -  Second visit: Participating children will spend 1 day in a room at the NIH Clinical
           Center Pediatric Day Hospital. During the visit, participants will wear a portable EEG
           unit to measure brain activity. For the first hour of the visit, researchers will
           perform movement tests to study the brain activity related to normal movements. For the
           rest of the day, participants may play games, watch television or movies, read, or nap,
           while continuing to wear the EEG to monitor brain activity related to the stereotypic
           movements.

NCT01037647,VLDL-triglyceride Kinetics in Type 2 Diabetes,"
      Type 2 diabetes is associated with diabetic dyslipidemia, which is a major risk factor for
      coronary heart disease. Triglycerides (TG) and cholesterol are transported in the system of
      lipoproteins, and the metabolism of these lipids in plasma is closely interrelated. Evidence
      suggests that increased concentration of very low-density lipoprotein triglyceride (VLDL-TG)
      is a central pathophysiological feature of the lipid and lipoprotein abnormalities in
      diabetic dyslipidemia.

      The objective of this study was to investigate VLDL-TG kinetics and aspects of peripheral
      VLDL-TG metabolism, i.e. to what extent VLDL-TG associated fatty acids (FA) are oxidized or
      deposited in regional adipose tissue, in subjects with type 2 diabetes and healthy controls

NCT01038570,Comparative Study Between Prader-Willi Patients Who Take Oxytocin Versus Placebo,"
      The role of oxytocin (OT) is already known in the regulation of satiety but some clinical
      studies demonstrated that OT participates also in the regulation of social behavior by its
      implication on a better comprehension of emotion which plays a role on theory of mind and
      empathy. By the way, these 2 behaviors are deviants for patients with Prader-Willi Syndrome
      (PWS). Actually, no study was led on the effect of OT on PWS patients but Swaab and al in
      1995 showed a significant reduction in number and in volume of neurons expressing OT in the
      paraventricular nucleus of PWS patients. Recent data were obtained studying OT in patients
      with autism which showed a link between the deregulation of OT and the autistic pathology.

      in the country but in the world. CCA is a slow growing but highly metastatic tumor. At
      present, there is no standard chemotherapy or effective treatment for CCA. Most of the
      patients have short survival after diagnosis. Strong evidences from in vitro, animal and
      clinical studies indicate that vitamin D can prevent and control growth of cancer. Our
      preclinical studies in CCA cell lines, animal and patient tissue culture indicate that
      vitamin D effectively reduce growth of CCA. Supplementation of vitamin D to chemotherapeutic
      drugs enhance drug toxicity and better response. At present, there are several clinical
      trials in USA on supplementation of vitamin D or its analogs to cancer patients. The side

      BPD are not always effective, or related to major side effects. The physiopathological
      factors that are identified in BPD should, in theory, respond to surfactant. Therefore, the
      use of an exogenous surfactant in neonates presenting with pulmonary disease requiring
      mechanical ventilation, leading to a significant risk of BPD, should allow earlier extubation

NCT01039363,"Vorinostat Combined With Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin, Idarubicin and Cytarabine in Acute Myeloid Leukemia","
      The prognosis of elderly patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is
      grave. Because of their chronological age and/or the presence of multiple co-morbidities,
      treatment-related mortality in elderly patients with AML is quite high although higher
      intensive treatment is mandatory to overcome chemoresistant characteristic of their disease.
      Several regimens have been evaluated as salvage chemotherapy for relapsed or refractory AML
      such as Mitoxantrone/High dose Cytarabine or Amsacrine/High dose Cytarabine. These regimens
      could achieve complete remission (CR) in a part of patients, but resulted in higher treatment
      related mortality (TRM). Accordingly, less intensive salvage regimen is needed for elderly
      patients with relapsed or refractory AML.

      The activity of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, Vorinostat or Suberoylanilide
      hydroxamic acid (SAHA), against AML has been suggested in cell line models and in animal
      model as well as in a phase 1 trial. The phase 1 study determined the MTD of oral Vorinostat
      as 200mg twice daily or 250mg thrice daily. In addition, the phase 1 trial showed the
      antitumor activity of Vorinostat with 17% of response rate in patients with advanced leukemia
      or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Accordingly, further study is recommended to demonstrate
      the clinical activity of Vorinostat in AML.

      In terms of the combining drug with Vorinostat, anthracycline is one of the best candidate. A
      in vitro study demonstrated that the combination of anthracycline (esp. idarubicin) with HDAC
      inhibitor have significant clinical activity against leukemia. Another candidate is
      Gemtuzumab ozogamicin, which is a calicheamicin-conjugated antibody directed against CD33
      antigen on AML blasts. The U.S. FDA also approved the use of GO in relapsed AML as a
      monotherapy. A study also showed that the combinational therapy of GO with attenuated doses
      of standard induction chemotherapy could successfully induce CR without increasing
      treatment-related mortality in AML patients aged 55 or older. A in vitro study reported that
      HDAC inhibitor valproic acid augmented the clinical activity of GO toward CD33+ AML cells.
      The study demonstrated that the strategy using HDAC inhibitor together with GO could
      potentially induce synergistic proapoptotic activity against AML blasts without increasing
      toxicity. In our center, so far we treated relapsed or refractory AML patients using the
      salvage regimen including GO (3mg/m2/dayx1day) plus attenuated Idarubicin/Cytarabine
      (Idarubicin 12mg/m2/day for 2 days and intermediate dose Cytarabine). So far, the CR rate
      from the regimen is around 50% without increasing TRM. Accordingly, we will determine the
      efficacy and toxicity of Vorinostat-incorporating salvage regimen based on the GO+IA
      chemotherapy in patients 50 years old or older with relapsed or refractory AML.

NCT01031979,Prolonged Exposure for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) With/Without Yohimbine,"
      The proposed study has three distinct but related research objectives. The first goal is to
      measure physiological correlates of successful treatment with Prolonged Exposure (PE) therapy
      for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.
      Individuals with PTSD often experience elevated heart rates and other objectively measurable
      signs of anxiety when confronted with safe situations that remind them of past dangerous
      situations. We will measure physiological responses and compare the outcomes to patient's
      self reported subjective accounts of symptom improvement on traditional measures of PTSD.
      Developing a way to measure objective gains in symptoms improvement may help researchers who
      are studying ways to improve PTSD treatment. The second goal of the study is to investigate
      if yohimbine, a drug found to promote a specific type of learning, will improve treatment
      outcomes for veterans in PTSD treatment. The third goal is to investigate if ability to get
      used to loud startling audio tones correlates to baseline PTSD pathology and treatment
      outcomes for PE. This goal represents an important step forward in understanding
      characteristics of heritable traits that are related PTSD. It is significant because such

NCT01030913,B-type Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (B-CLL) Subgroups: Maturation Stage and Gene Expression,"
      B type chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) is the most prevalent leukemia in the western
      world. It is a disease that occurs primarily in aging individuals and occurs more frequently
      in males than females. Although B-CLL was considered a homogeneous condition, recent studies
      by our laboratory and others suggest that B-CLL cases can be divided into two subgroups.

      These sub-groups can be identified by either the presence or the absence of mutations in
      antibody genes and/or by the percentage of B-CLL cells expressing a particular protein called
      CD38. These two sub-groups (unmutated antibody genes high percent CD38 and mutated antibody
      genes low percentage CD38) follow strikingly clinically different courses. For example, the
      unmutated/CD38+ group experiences a much more aggressive disease and these patients almost
      invariably die much sooner than the cases in the other group. In addition, the patients in
      the mutated CD38+ group require much more chemotherapy than mutatedlCD38-. Finally,
      surprisingly there is a much higher representation of males in the poor outcome unmutated
      CD38 group than in the better outcome group. The reasons for these differences in clinical
      outcome and gender bias are unknown.

      1. Study name:Amlodipine Prevents Morning Blood Pressure Surge Study

        2. Study drugs:amlodipine (Norvasc®) and nifedipine GITS (Adalat®)

        3. Rationale: Several recent studies compared 24-h blood pressure lowering effect of these
           2 dihydropyridine drugs, amlodipine and nifedipine GITS, but produced inconsistent
           results. Therefore, a randomized controlled trial with a larger sample size is required
           to compare these 2 dihydropyridines in the blood pressure control over 24 hours in
           general and during early morning hours and at night in particular.

        4. Objective: The primary objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that amlodipine
           compared with nifedipine GITS has a stronger effect in preventing morning blood pressure
           surge (4 am to 8 am) in mild to moderate hypertensive patients.The secondary objective
           of the study is to compare the effects of amlodipine and nifedipine GITS in reducing
           nighttime blood pressure (10 pm to 4 am) in patients with a decreased nocturnal blood
           pressure fall.

        5. Study design: The present study is designed as a randomized, actively controlled,
           multi-centre parallel group trial (phase Ⅳ) with two equally sized treatment groups:
           amlodipine and nifedipine GITS.

        6. Study population: 500 hypertensive patients meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria.

        7. Randomization and treatment: After stratification for centre, 500 eligible patients will
           be randomized into 2 groups. 250 will receive amlodipine 5 mg per day, and 250 will
           receive nifedipine GITS 30 mg per day. At 4 weeks of follow-up, the drug dosage per day
           may increase to 10 mg of amlodipine and 60 mg of nifedipine GITS, if blood pressure
           measured in doctor's office cannot be controlled to a level below 140/90 mm Hg. If there
           were no compelling indication, no other antihypertensive drug is allowed during the
           2-month trial.

        8. Follow up: All patients should give written informed consent at entry into the present
           study. In addition to 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, patients should also
           undergo a questionnaire survey and clinical measurements including clinic blood
           pressure. Patients will be followed up at the end of 4 weeks and 8 weeks after
           randomization.

NCT01031563,Risk Perception in Drug-Dependent Adults With and Without Schizophrenia,"
      Background:

        -  Several studies of risk perception have demonstrated a common bias known as unrealistic
           optimism, in which individuals feel they are less likely than other people to experience
           unpleasant or harmful events in their lives, but more likely to experience pleasant or
           beneficial events.

        -  Previous research has indicated that individuals with schizophrenia have less of a sense
           of unrealistic optimism about adverse events than individuals without schizophrenia.
           However, research on risk perception in schizophrenia is sparse, primarily reporting on
           behaviors and decisions in the laboratory that likely are influenced by risk perception.

        -  Risk perception among substance users may be viewed in two separate categories:
           perception of vulnerability to adverse events and perception of vulnerability to
           negative outcomes associated with substance use. Research in both areas has yielded
           mixed results. Researchers are interested in studying the connections among
           schizophrenia, addiction, and risk perception in order to develop better drug use
           prevention and treatment programs for people with and without schizophrenia.

      Objectives:

      - To compare unrealistic optimism bias in people with and without schizophrenia and/or drug
      dependence, and its association with actual risky behavior.

      Eligibility:

        -  Individuals between 18 and 64 years of age who fall into one of the following study
           categories:

        -  diagnoses of both drug dependence (marijuana or cocaine) and
           schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder

        -  diagnosis of drug dependence only (marijuana or cocaine)

        -  diagnosis of schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder only

        -  healthy volunteers with no history of drug use or serious mental disorder

      Design:

        -  The study will require a single visit to the research center for a 5- to 6-hour session.

        -  Participants will complete questionnaires on medical and behavioral history, complete
           tests of thinking skills like memory and attention, complete a brief computerized
           decision-making task, and answer questions about risk perception.

        -  Participants will also provide urine samples and breath carbon monoxide measurements to
           test for recent use of tobacco and other substances.

      1. Primary objective #1: Determine the relative effectiveness of MI-IOP and MI-PC in the
           full study sample with regard to treatment engagement over weeks 1-12 and
           cocaine/alcohol use over weeks 1-24.

             -  Hypothesis 1: An intervention that explores several possible treatment options with
                the patient and provides the chosen option (e.g., MI-PC) will produce higher rates
                of treatment engagement than an intervention focused on engagement in IOP only
                (e.g., MI-IOP).

             -  Hypothesis 2: An intervention that explores several possible treatment options with
                the patient and provides the chosen option (e.g., MI-PC) will produce better
                cocaine/alcohol use outcomes than an intervention focused on engagement in IOP only
                (MI-IOP).

             -  Secondary analysis 1: Among the Non-engaged patients, determine rates of selection
                of each of the three options in MI-PC, retention rates within each option, and
                cocaine/alcohol use outcomes in each option.

             -  Secondary analysis 2: Among the Engaged patients, determine rates of selection of
                each of the three options in MI-PC, retention rates within each option, and
                cocaine/alcohol use outcomes in each option.

        2. Primary objective #2: Determine whether the relative effectiveness of MI-IOP and MI-PC
           varies as a function of engagement group, with regard to treatment engagement over weeks
           1-12 and cocaine/alcohol use outcomes over weeks 1-24.

             -  Hypothesis 1: The predicted main effect on retention favoring MI-PC over MI-IOP
                will be significantly larger among patients in the Non-engaged group than among
                those in the Engaged group.

             -  Hypothesis 2: The predicted main effect on cocaine/alcohol use outcomes favoring
                MI-PC over MI-IOP will be significantly larger among patients in the Non-engaged
                group than among those in the Engaged group.

NCT01032655,The Efficacy of Susceptibility Test -Driven Sequential Therapy as the Third Line Therapy for Refractory Helicobacter Pylori Infection,"
      Background: Helicobacter pylori infection has been shown to be associated with the
      development of gastric cancer and peptic ulcer diseases. Eradication of H. pylori infection
      could reduce the occurence or recurrence of these diseases. However, it was estimated that
      15-20% of patients would fail from first line standard eradication therapy and need second
      line rescue therapy. About 15-30% of patient would fail from second line therapy and need to
      be rescued with third line therapy. The commonly used salvage regimens include (1) Bismuth
      based quadruple therapy (combined with ranitidine or PPI plus two antibiotics) (2)
      Levofloxacin or moxifloxacin or rifabutin based triple therapy. However, Bismuth is not
      available in many countries and the administration method is complex. Its usage is limited by
      the high pill number and low compliance rate. In recent years, the concept of sequential
      therapy has been advocated in the treatment of H. pylori infection. The regimen includes a
      PPI plus amoxicillin for five days, followed by a PPI plus clarithromycin and metronidazole
      for another five days. The eradication rate in the first line treatment of sequential therapy
      had been reported to be as high as 90%. More importantly, it has been demonstrated that the
      eradication rate among patients with clarithromycin-resistant strains could be as high as
      89%. According to the Maastricht III consensus meeting, it was recommended that
      susceptibility test should be done for patients who failed two treatments. Therefore, we
      aimed to assess the efficacy of susceptibility test driven sequential therapy as the third
      line therapy for those who fail from two standard eradication therapies.

      Methods: This will be a multi-center, open labeled pilot study

        1. Patients:

             -  Open labeled, non-comparative pilot study

        2. Testing for H. pylori infection:

             -  Before salvage treatment:

           either (1) any two positive of CLO test, histology, and culture or (2) a positive
           C13-UBT will be considered as failure of previous eradication treatment EGD with gastric
           biopsy will be done for H. pylori culture and susceptibility test

             -  After salvage treatment: C13-UBT will be used to assess the existence of H. pylori
                after 2nd or 3rd line salvage therapy

        3. Treatment regimens and assignment:

             -  D1-7: Nexium (40 mg, bid), Amolin (1 gm, bid)

             -  D8-14: Nexium (40 mg, bid), Flagyl (500 mg, bid) plus either one of the following

NCT01032876,Cerebral Perfusion During Neonatal Cardiac Surgery,"
      Neonates with a congenital heart defect are often in need of early cardiac surgery. In
      complex congenital heart defects, cardiopulmonary bypass is usually employed, with or without
      deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA). The brain is especially vulnerable to ischemic
      injury, which puts neonates undergoing complex operations at high risk of neurodevelopmental
      disorders. Selective antegrade cerebral perfusion (ACP) instead of DHCA during these complex
      operations may contribute to less cerebral damage, but literature is not conclusive on this
      issue.

      Therefore, the investigators will perform a randomised controlled trial comparing DHCA and
      ACP in neonatal aortic arch reconstructions, focusing on cerebral damage and neurological
      outcome.

      Hypothesis:

      The first part of the study is a survey on the prevalence of anemia of chronic disease (ACD)
      among COPD patients. The 2nd and 3rd part will test 2 null hypotheses (Ho): 1.serum
      inflammatory markers and plasma erythropoietin do not differ between COPD patients with and
      without ACD and 2. exercise capacity does not differ between COPD patients with and without
      ACD.

      Rationale-Aim:

      ACD is an immune driven disorder, developing in subjects suffering from chronic inflammatory
      diseases. COPD is a disorder very likely to be associated to ACD due to its systemic
      inflammatory dimension. Currently, data on the prevalence of ACD and on the level of
      inflammatory markers which are implicated in the pathogenesis of ACD in COPD subjects are
      limited and controversial. Furthermore, there is no data on the effect of ACD on exercise
      capacity of COPD subjects.

      Based to the aforementioned, this study has three goals:

        1. to determine the prevalence and the epidemiologic characteristics of ACD in a population
           of clinical stable COPD patients

        2. to investigate whether the levels of serum inflammatory markers and of plasma
           erythropoietin differ between COPD patients with ACD and without ACD

        3. to determine potential differences regarding the aerobic exercise capacity between these
           two groups, using the cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET).

      The purpose of this study is to compare two different ways to administer Letrozole to
      determine their effectiveness in blocking estrogen production during ovarian stimulation in
      patients with breast cancer prior to chemotherapy/radiotherapy so that oocytes or embryos can
      be cryopreserved and patients can possibly achieve a pregnancy after the treatment of breast
      cancer.

      During standard ovulation stimulation, the estrogen levels will exceed normal levels and may
      reach 10 times the normal level for a 2 week period. This may not be desirable in breast
      cancer patients. The study hopes to determine if the investigators can stimulate oocyte
      development in the conventional way and administer different doses of Letrozole as the
      oocytes develop, to keep estradiol levels low, increase the number of oocytes the
      investigators are able to recover, and improve the quality of those oocytes.

      propose, moderates the effect of the HBPM intervention. We hypothesize that patients who have
      a better understanding of their illness and its prescribed treatment will be more adherent to
      the treatment regimen, and thus will exhibit improved outcomes compared to those who have
      been exposed to the same intervention, but who do not have a clear understanding of these

      Background:

      - Schizophrenia is associated with cognitive impairment in different parts of the brain,
      including those associated with learning and memory. The brain activity associated with these
      impairments, however, is poorly understood. Researchers are interested in studying how the
      brain chemical dopamine, which is involved in responding to incentives and rewards like money
      or food, works differently in the brains of people who have schizophrenia.

      Objectives:

      - To study reward processing in individuals with schizophrenia who are taking different types
      of medication, compared with healthy volunteers.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals between 18 and 55 years of age who (a) have been diagnosed with
      schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder and are taking the antipsychotic medication clozapine,
      (b), have been diagnosed with schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder and are taking a
      different second-generation antipsychotic, or (c) are healthy volunteers.

      Design:

        -  This study will involve one screening visit and one or more visits for testing and
           functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans. During the screening visit,
           participants will complete questionnaires and provide information about their physical
           and psychological health.

        -  Participants will receive training in the tasks to be performed at the scanning sessions
           during the screening visit.

NCT01036074,Reward Processing in Cocaine Addiction,"
      Background:

      - Cocaine affects the brain's ability to process information. However, different people
      respond to cocaine in different ways, and differences in brain structure and function may
      affect how cocaine alters brain activity. By using functional magnetic resonance imaging
      (fMRI) to monitor brain activity during tasks that provide simple rewards, researchers hope
      to better understand how the brain responds to rewards and how this response is affected by
      drugs like cocaine.

      Objectives:

        -  To determine the effect of cocaine administration on the reward experience in
           cocaine-dependent individuals.

        -  To study genetic and personality factors that may contribute to cocaine dependence.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals between 18 and 45 years of age who either are cocaine-dependent and not seeking
      treatment or are healthy volunteers.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be asked to avoid consuming alcohol and restrict consumption of
           caffeine prior to the study. Participants provide urine and breath samples to be tested
           for chemicals that may interfere with the study.

        -  All participants will complete a training session and at least one fMRI scanning
           session. During the training session, participants will be introduced to the reward
           tasks and MRI equipment.

        -  Healthy volunteers will have a single fMRI session that will involve reward tasks to be
           completed during the scanning. Rewards will include small amounts of fruit juice and the
           opportunity to win money.

        -  Cocaine-dependent participants will have a training session and three experimental
           sessions including 1) a mock MRI scan to test cocaine tolerance, 2) one fMRI scan with
           reward tasks after administration of IV cocaine, and 3) one fMRI scan with reward tasks
           after administration of IV placebo (saline solution). Rewards will include small amounts
           of fruit juice and the opportunity to win money.

NCT01036971,Screening Protocol for the Evaluation of Potential Research Subjects,"
      Background:

      - The Neuroimaging Research Branch of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) is
      interested in developing a pool of potential research participants who may be eligible for
      research studies on drug abuse and addiction, pharmacological and psychosocial therapies for
      substance addiction, and the long-term effects of drugs on the development, function, and
      structure of the brain and other organ systems. To develop this pool of potential
      participants, researchers intend to screen adolescents and adults who may be eligible for
      future research studies.

      Objectives:

      - To identify, recruit, and screen participants for NIDA neuroimaging research protocols.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals 13 years of age and older who are able to provide informed consent.

      Design:

        -  Eligible participants will undergo two screening interviews: a telephone interview and
           an in-person interview. The phone interview will determine eligibility for the in-person
           interview. Adolescents who are eligible for further screening must bring a parent or
           guardian with them to the in-person interview.

        -  The in-person interview may require up to five visits to the NIDA clinical center. The
           in-person visit will involve any or all of the following procedures: (1) full physical
           examination and medical history; (2) psychiatric interview; (3) psychological testing;
           (4) electrocardiogram; (5) samples of blood, urine, and hair; and (6) other minimally
           invasive procedures as directed by the research staff.

        -  During the screening process, participants will be explicitly asked for permission to
           recontact them after the 1-year duration of the screening protocol. For minors, both the
           adolescent and the parent/guardian must agree to future contact.

NCT01037140,Effects of Vitamin D Supplementation in Obesity,"
      Obesity is an increasing health problem with numerous metabolic complications. Vitamin D
      deficiency is common in obesity, and in epidemiological studies vitamin D deficiency has been
      linked to metabolic complications, such as type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance and
      cardiovascular disease, as well as myopathy, osteoporosis and depression. In obesity, a low
      grade inflammation is present in the fat tissue, thereby releasing inflammatory molecules to
      the blood stream. In cell line studies as well as small clinical studies vitamin D has been
      shown to have the ability to reduce inflammation and cell growth.

      In the present study the investigators wish to investigate the effect of vitamin D on fat-,
      muscle and bone metabolism. 30 healthy obese subjects will be treated with cholecalciferol
      175 micrograms daily for 6 months and will be compared with 30 healthy obese subjects treated
      with placebo.

      The investigators hypothesize that restoring vitamin D levels in vitamin D deficient obese
      subject will reduce inflammation and thereby reduce obesity-related complications.

      The effect will be evaluated as follows:

        -  Levels of circulating inflammatory markers will be examined in blood samples collected
           prior to and after treatment.

        -  Effects on fat- and muscle metabolism will be evaluated in fat- and muscle samples taken
           before and after treatment.

        -  Effects on fat distribution will be evaluated by MRI scan before and after treatment.

        -  Effects on insulin sensitivity will be evaluated by hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp
           performed on a subgroup of subjects with impaired fasting glucose.

        -  Effects on bone marrow density will be evaluated by DEXA scans before and after
           treatment.

        -  Effects on quality of life and depression score will be evaluated by questionnaires used
           before and after treatment.

NCT01037153,Effects of Nicotine on Brain Activity as Measured by fMRI,"
      Background:

      - Nicotine addiction is common among people who smoke tobacco, and the addictive properties
      of nicotine make smoking cessation difficult even for people who want to quit. Research has
      shown that smoking causes changes in the brain that lead to addiction and craving, but more
      research is needed to determine how different doses of nicotine and different intervals of
      receiving nicotine affect brain function. A greater understanding of nicotine's effect on the
      brain, as studied through functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), may improve the
      effectiveness of smoking cessation therapies and treatments.

      Objectives:

      - To determine the effects of nicotine on brain function and chemistry in experienced
      cigarette smokers.

      Eligibility:

      - Current smokers (at least 20 cigarettes per day for at least 1 year) between 18 and 50
      years of age.

      Design:

        -  The study involves five separate research experiments. Most participants will be
           involved in only one experiment.

        -  The experiments will evaluate brain activity and function using fMRI. Participants will
           be trained in a series of tests on cognitive function before beginning the experimental
           part of the study.

        -  Experiment 1: Participants will have three fMRI scan sessions after receiving different
           dose levels of intravenous nicotine.

        -  Experiment 2: Participants will have four fMRI scan sessions after receiving two doses
           of nicotine separated by 1/4, 1/2, 3, and 24 hours.

        -  Experiment 3: Participants will have two sets of nicotine injections separated by 45
           minutes, with each injection series containing five rapid injections of small amounts of
           nicotine (to mimic five puffs on a cigarette).

        -  Experiment 4: Participants will have three fMRI sessions after receiving a single
           injection of nicotine at three different rates (over 15, 60, or 120 seconds). In
           addition there will be three more sessions involving a nicotine patch and a nicotine
           injection as well as a placebo session.

        -  Experiment 5: Participants will have three fMRI sessions that will involve looking at
           different kinds of pictures related to or not related to smoking after receiving a
           single injection of nicotine.

NCT01037491,Comparison of Ulcer Healing in Patients Taking Rabeprazole With Different Antiplatelets,"
      Clopidogrel causes significantly less peptic ulcer disease (PUD) and ulcer bleeding than
      low-dose aspirin in general population. However, clopidogrel is not safe enough for
      gastrointestinal (GI) mucosa in patients who had past history of aspirin-associated ulcer or
      ulcer bleeding. Aspirin plus proton pump inhibitor (PPI) is superior to clopidogrel alone in
      preventing recurrent ulcer bleeding in these high risk patients.

      This study is to compare the ulcer healing rate and ulcer bleeding at 12 weeks in patients
      with aspirin-associated PUD when they take PPI (rabeprazole 20 mg/day) to treat their PUD and
      simultaneously take aspirin or clopidogrel for their cardiovascular (CV) prevention. Two
      hundred patients will be randomly assigned rabeprazole (20 mg/day) plus aspirin (100 mg/day)
      or rabeprazole (20 mg/day) plus clopidogrel (75 mg/day) for 12 weeks. The primary end point
      is treatment success (ulcer healing rate). The secondary end point is incidence of ulcer
      bleeding within 12 weeks.

      If rabeprazole plus aspirin in not inferior to rabeprazole plus clopidogrel in the incidence
      of ulcer healing and ulcer bleeding in the healing phase,PPI plus aspirin rather than PPI
      plus clopidogrel will be recommended during acute ulcer healing in patients who need

NCT01037738,Study of Autologous Conditioned Serum After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstructive Surgery,"
      Abstract

      Background

      Pro-inflammatory cytokines play a pivotal role in osteoarthritis, as well as in bone tunnel
      widening after ACL reconstructive surgery. A new treatment option is to administer autologous
      conditioned serum (ACS) containing endogenous anti-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1Ra
      and growth factors (IGF-1, PDGF and TGF-ß1, among others) in the liquid blood phase.

      Objective The purpose of this trial was to establish whether the osteoclastic effect could be
      affected by intra-articular application of ACS, thus resulting in a potential decrease of
      knee laxity and leading to a better postoperative outcome.

      Methods In a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial with two
      parallel groups, 62 patients were treated. Bone tunnel width was measured by CT scans, while
      clinical efficacy was assessed by patient-administered outcome instruments (WOMAC, IKDC 2000)
      up to one year following the ACL reconstruction in patients receiving either ACS (Group A) or
      placebo (Group B). The investigators compared the levels and dynamics of IL-1b concentrations
      in the synovial liquid and examined the correlation between the levels of IL-1b at three
      different post-operative points.

NCT01037777,"RISCA : Prospective Study of Individuals at Risk for SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7","
      The spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of
      autosomal dominantly inherited progressive ataxia disorders. It is estimated that there are
      30,000 individuals in the European Community that directly descend from individuals affected
      by a SCA disorder and thus carry a 50% risk of having inherited an SCA mutation. These at
      risk individuals provide a unique research opportunity to prospectively study the
      presymptomatic phase of SCA disorders and to identify the earliest and most sensitive
      clinical signs and biological markers that herald the onset of the illness. This information
      is of critical importance for the development of future therapeutic interventions aimed at
      postponing the clinical onset of ataxia.

      We therefore propose to perform a prospective observational study of individuals at risk for
      the most common SCA disorders, SCA1, SCA2, SCA3 and SCA6 (RISCA). It is our aim to answer the
      following questions: (1) What is the incidence of disease manifestation in mutation carriers?
      (2) Which clinical signs precede the onset of manifest ataxia in SCA1, SCA2, SCA3 and SCA6?
      (3) What are the prevalence and incidence of preceding signs? (4) Are the prevalence and
      incidence of preceding signs affected by genotype, gender, age, estimated time until disease
      manifestation and repeat length? (5) Does the presence of certain preceding signs predict the
      manifestation of ataxia ? (6) Are there MRI alterations that precede the onset of ataxia? It
      is planned to enroll 480 study participants and to follow them at regular intervals over six
      years. At each visit, study participants are asked in a structured interview for a number of
      predefined clinical signs that potentially precede the onset of ataxia. In addition, the
      following self-assessment scales will be applied: Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI),
      Diagnostic Criteria for Restless Legs Syndrome, Patient´s Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). All
      study participants will undergo a physical examination including the Scale for the Assessment
      and Rating of Ataxia (SARA). Study participants will further perform the SCA Functional
      Composite (SCA-FC) which is a comprehensive measure of functional capacity based on results
      in quantitative tests related to gait (8m timed walk), speech (PATA rate) and hand function
      (9 hole pegboard). In a subset of study participants, we will record eye movements and obtain
      volumetric MRIs. The study will also be used to collect and store blood and urine samples for
      proteomic and gene expression studies.

NCT01038219,Reliability of Subjective Assessment of Fever by Parents and Health Care Providers in Children and Adolescents,"
      Background: Fever is a widespread symptom in many diseases. Therefore, its value and
      diagnostic importance are well known. Fever in children is one of the common reasons for a
      visit to the pediatrician. Also, taking temperature is a very simple action and accessible to
      the general public.

      Temperature is measured in various parts of the body by using medical equipment. The type of
      method and thermometer varies according to the patient's age but often temperature is
      estimated by touch. Temperature measurement serves as a means for monitoring the patient's
      condition. For that reason, supervision of the body temperature is an important factor in the
      process of taking medical decisions.

      Study rationale: the parent is often asked if the child's temperature has been taken. The
      most frequent answer is: ""I didn't measure, but I felt that he has a temperature"". The few
      studies carried out on this subject showed that many parents used touch to evaluate the
      child's body temperature, especially in infants.

      Some studies checked the reliability of parents to estimate the child's body temperature by
      touch only. To the best of our knowledge, the reliability of medical staff (nurses) to
      estimate the child's body temperature by touch has never been studied.

      The aim of the current study is to investigate whether parents and nurses correctly estimate
      the child's body temperature by touch, as compared to thermometer measurement during the
      pediatric unit's routine work.

      Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a severe pulmonary vascular affection, which
      treatment has evolved in the last few years, improving quality of life. However, adherence to
      treatment has not been assessed in such patients. The investigators developed a collaborative
      care model involving clinical pharmacists in PAH. The objective of this work is to evaluate
      the impact of such model of care on medication errors and adverse events, quality of life and
      clinical criteria.

      This randomized multicentre controlled study will include approximately 100 PAH patients

      societal costs in terms of quality of life, social and work functioning, health care use, and
      lost productivity. Although single therapy approaches such as medication, graduated exercise,
      and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) are well-established treatment approaches, the
      majority of FMS continue to report significant levels of pain and pain-related disability.
      Testing the efficacy of using combination therapies such and CBT with medication has
      considerable potential to maximize treatment response. Also, exploring the biological and
      psychological mechanisms underlying combination treatment may pave the way for developing new
      treatments for FMS sufferers.

      We chose to study drug and CBT for several reasons: 1) the scarcity of trials that manipulate
      medications along with CBT in FMS, 2) the prohibitive nature of adding an exercise treatment
      arm in a study that has both time and budgetary constraints, 3) the complexity in
      understanding the mechanism of actions of 3 different modes of intervention in one clinical
      trial, and 4) the desire to explore mechanisms in this program of research, in particular the
      potential effects of a biological intervention (drug) on what is traditionally considered a
      psychological outcome (pain-related attributions and cognition) and the potential effects of
      a psychological intervention (CBT) on what is traditionally considered a physiological

      The aim of the CHAT study (""An open-label, randomized Phase II study of Herceptin
      (trastuzumab), Taxotere® (docetaxel) and Xeloda (capecitabine) in combination, versus
      Herceptin (trastuzumab) plus Taxotere® (docetaxel), in patients with advanced and/or
      metastatic breast cancers that overexpress HER2"") was to test the combination of Trastuzumab
      and Docetaxel with or without capecitabine as first-line therapy for HER2 positive locally
      advanced or metastatic breast cancer.

      Overall Response Rate was the primary endpoint of the CHAT study. This study failed to meet
      its primary objective of showing a difference between the treatment groups, with equivalent
      high response rates for the Trastuzumab plus Docetaxel and Trastuzumab, Docetaxel plus
      capecitabine arms.

      Secondary endpoints in the CHAT study were Progression-Free-Survival, Time-to-Progression,
      Overall Survival, duration of response and safety profile. Whilst analysis of the existing
      data is consistent with improvement with the triplet therapy, interpretation is compromised
      by the relatively short median follow-up of 24 months. In hindsight the statistical design
      was flawed by selection of a sub optimal primary endpoint and consequently data was collected
      and analysed early in relation to time-dependent endpoints. Beyond CHAT will permit capture
      of mature data for time-related endpoints. Time-to-Progression and Overall Survival are the
      co-primary endpoints for the Beyond CHAT protocol. The impact of treatment following the
      first progression, on survival, will be explored.

      Time-to-Progression will be defined from the time interval between the date of randomisation
      and the occurrence of progressive disease under therapy according to RECIST criteria.

      Overall Survival will be defined as the time from date of randomisation to date of death

NCT01039298,Efficacy of Optically-guided Surgery in the Management of Early-staged Oral Cancer - COOLS TRIAL,"
      Oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a global disease responsible for ~300,000 new cancer
      cases each year. Local recurrence (~30% of cases) and formation of second primary malignancy
      are common.2, 3 Cosmetic and/or functional compromise associated with treatment of disease
      stage is often significant. These statistics underscore the urgent need to develop a better
      approach in order to control this deadly disease.

      It is becoming increasingly apparent that oral cancers develop within wide fields of diseased
      tissue characterized by genetically altered cells that are widespread across the oral cavity
      and present in clinically and histologically normal oral mucosa. Complete removal of these
      lesions is difficult because high-risk changes frequently go beyond clinically visible tumor.
      In recognition of this, current 'best practice' is to remove SCC with a significant width
      (usually 10 mm) of surrounding normal-looking oral mucosa. However, since occult disease
      varies in size such approach often results in over-cutting (causing severe cosmetic and
      functional morbidity) or under removal of disease tissue, as evidenced by frequent positive
      surgical margins and high local and regional recurrence - a failure of the 'best practice.

      There is a wealth of literature that supports the use of tissue autofluorescence in the
      screening and diagnosis of precancers in the lung, uterine cervix, skin and oral cavity. This
      approach is already in clinical use in the lung and the mechanism of action of tissue
      autofluorescence has been well described in the cervix. Changes in fluorescence reflect a
      complex interplay of alterations to fluorophores in the tissue and structural changes in
      tissue morphology, each associated with progression of the disease.

      As one of the internationally leading teams in applying tissue fluorescence technology, we
      have shown that direct fluorescence visualization (FV) tools can identify clinically visible
      or occult premalignant and malignant lesions that are associated with lesions at risk, with
      high-grade histology and high-risk molecular change. In a recently small scaled,
      retrospective study, we have shown that FV helped surgeons in the operating room to determine
      the extent of the high-risk FV field surrounding the cancer and resulted in remarkably lower
      2-year recurrence rates (0% for FV-guided vs. 25% for those without FV-guided approach).
      There is need to design a larger scale prospective, randomized controlled (Phase III) trial
      to gather strong evidence in proving the efficacy of the surgery approach using this adjunct
      tool.

      To establish the evidence supporting the change in clinical practice using FV-guided surgery.
      There are 3 objectives.

      2.1. Objective 1 (Clinical evidence): To assess the effect of FV-guided surgery on the
      recurrence-free survival of histologically confirmed disease within the context of a
      randomized controlled trial (efficacy). Hypothesis: FV-guided surgery will increase the
      recurrence-free survival.

      2.2. Objective 2 (Quality of Life evidence): To establish the cost per recurrence prevented
      for this approach and assess quality of life issues. Hypothesis: FV-guided surgery can be
      delivered in a cost effective manner and improve the quality of life of patients 2.3
      Objective 3 (Scientific/Molecular evidence): To assess the presence of previously validated
      molecular markers (microsatellite analysis, LOH) and histological change (quantitative
      pathology) in surgical margins in a nested case-control study involving a tumor bank created
      within this project. Hypothesis: FV-guided surgery will spare normal tissue at the same time
      improving capture of high-risk tissue.

NCT01031576,Postural Analysis in Patients With Knee Osteoarthritis,"
      Osteoarthritis is the result of the degeneration of the cartilage to articulate, being
      currently considered as having an multifactorial cause.The knees are one of the affected
      joints more due to overload that constitutes the main activator or determinative mechanism
      for the development of the illness. Beyond pain it has important reduction of the amplitude
      of movement and the muscular force that causes functional limitation and posture's
      alterations intervening with the activities of daily life. Therefore, the main objective of
      this study will be to characterize the posture's alterations and the electromiographic
      activity in patients with osteoarthritis of knees. For this study 30 citizens will be
      evaluated, 15 with diagnosis of OA of knees unilaterally and 15 healthful citizens, both the
      groups will be of the feminine sex with age between 60 to 80 years. The selected patients
      will answer a questionnaire of personal dates and will have an evaluation fiche, in which
      will be written down: age, index of corporal mass (IMC), index of Lesquene, index WOMAC

NCT01031693,Pilot Study of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) in Nicotine Addiction,"
      Background:

        -  Treatment for nicotine addiction is characterized by high rates of relapse. New
           treatment therapies for nicotine addiction are exploring the use of brain scanning
           equipment to control and decrease nicotine and cigarette cravings.

        -  Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) uses magnetic pulses to stimulate the brain.
           These pulses can change activity in parts of the brain. Researchers are interested in
           determining whether TMS delivered in single pulses can decrease activity in the parts of
           the brain that respond to nicotine craving.

      Objectives:

      - To determine whether single pulse TMS can reduce cue-induced nicotine craving and use in
      cigarette smokers.

      Eligibility:

        -  Individuals 18 years of age and older who are physically healthy and have smoked 10 or
           more cigarettes per day for at least 1 year.

        -  A small group of healthy nonsmoking control subjects 18 years of age and older will also
           participate in the study.

      Design:

        -  The study will involve seven study visits and two follow-up visits. The control
           participants will have only two visits: one with a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
           and one with TMS to evaluate brain function and response.

        -  Participants will have an initial assessment about tobacco use habits and craving
           patterns, and will provide blood and urine samples before beginning the study.

        -  Participants will have two initial MRI brain scans. The first scan will look at the
           structure of the brain at rest. During the other scan, participants will look at images
           related to and not related to cigarette smoking.

        -  The single pulse TMS sessions (with either actual TMS or inactive [sham] TMS) will be
           held daily for 5 consecutive days. Magnetic pulses will be triggered by
           cigarette-related picture cues and delivered at varying intervals before the participant
           sees a cigarette-related picture. During these testing visits, researchers will ask
           questions related to tobacco use and craving, and collect urine and breath samples for
           further study.

        -  Participants will have two follow-up visits, 1 week and 2 weeks after the TMS sessions,
           to evaluate memory and mood, and will have one final MRI brain scan at the end of the
           study.

NCT01032928,Respiratory-Swallow Training in Veterans With Oropharyngeal Cancer,"
      Cancers of the head and neck require surgical, radiation, and chemotherapy treatments that
      are intended to cure the disease. These treatments have toxic effects on muscles and
      structures that are necessary to swallow safely and efficiently. The resulting swallowing
      problems (dysphagia) often remain chronic for Veterans and interfere with their ability to
      eat and drink. The cost burden to the VA health system is high. There is an urgent need to
      develop rehabilitative treatments that lessen these burdens. The proposed research is
      designed to test a novel swallowing therapy that includes the coordination of breathing with
      swallowing. Our study will train medically and surgically treated, chronically dysphagic
      Veterans with histories of oropharyngeal cancer in a novel therapy that involves both
      swallowing and respiratory systems. If the therapy is found to be effective, the long term
      goal of the project is to extend the study to a multi-site, clinical trial and test the
      longstanding effect of this treatment compared to other swallowing therapies on swallowing
      function, QOL and cost.

      leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched ex vivo expanded cord blood progenitors following treatment
      with clofarabine and cytarabine for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The
      combination of clofarabine, cytarabine (Ara-C) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor
      (G-CSF) has been tested in earlier studies for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia. In
      these previous clinical trials, this combination of drugs has been shown to have an
      anti-leukemia effect. However, the combination of clofarabine and Ara-C is profoundly
      myelosuppressive and immunosuppressive causing periods of neutropenia potentially lasting
      more than three weeks. During this period, patients are at increased risk of infections that
      can result in an increased risk of death. G-CSF is a growth factor that is used to help the
      white blood cells recover more quickly, but even with G-CSF, the use of clofarabine and Ara-C
      is often limited by the need to take long breaks between treatments to allow blood counts to
      recover. In our lab we have developed a method of growing or ""expanding"" blood stem cells
      (cells that give rise to the blood system) from umbilical cord blood. We are doing this study
      to find out if giving these expanded cells after chemotherapy is safe, helps the blood system

NCT01034384,"Physiological, Cognitive and Cerebral Activity Changes as a Function of Cigarette Smoking (With or Without Nicotine) and Tobacco Abstinence","
      Background:

        -  Denicotinized cigarettes are similar to commercial cigarettes but contain and deliver
           virtually no nicotine. Denicotinized cigarettes are used as a control condition in
           smoking research, as a substitute treatment for nicotine dependence, and as a strategy
           to reduce incidence of nicotine addiction. However, the symptoms of nicotine withdrawal
           and craving for cigarettes must be minimized to ensure that smokers will continue to use
           denicotinized cigarettes instead of their preferred cigarettes.

        -  Although research has shown that smokers preferred cigarettes that delivered nicotine,
           subjective measures of tobacco craving and withdrawal were similar after standard and
           denicotinized cigarettes. This suggests that the process of smoking and non-nicotine
           components of tobacco smoke mediate some of the effects of cigarette smoking. More
           research is needed on the comparative physical and mental effects of regular cigarettes
           and denicotinized cigarettes.

      Objectives:

      - To compare the effects of complete abstinence or smoking denicotinized cigarettes with

NCT01034761,Using Clinical Alerts to Decrease Inappropriate Medication Prescribing,"
      Introduction:

      The Beers list identifies medications that should be avoided in persons 65 years or older
      because they are ineffective, pose an unnecessarily high risk, or a safer alternative is
      available. In a recent study, we found a high rate of prescribing of Beers list medications
      to hospitalized patients. At Baystate, 41% of medical patients received at least one Beers
      list drug classified as ""high severity,"" meaning it carried a high risk for an adverse drug
      reaction, while 5% received 3 or more. Some Beers drugs have been associated with delirium
      and falls. When compared to Baystate patients who did not receive a high severity medication,
      those who did had an increased risk of mortality (7.8% vs. 5.2%), longer length of stay (5.5
      days vs. 3.9 days) and higher costs ($11,240 vs. 6243).

      Specific Aims:

        1. Quantify the impact of synchronous electronic alerts on physician prescribing of
           high-severity Beers' list drugs to hospitalized patients over the age of 65 years.

        2. Compare physician reactions to each drug-specific alert

      Project Description:

      We will develop a series of clinical alerts in CIS, Baystate's computerized provider order
      entry system, to reduce the use of potentially inappropriate medications among hospitalized
      elders. We will randomize providers to electronic alerts or usual care. Whenever a provider
      randomized to alerts attempts to place an order for a high-risk medication on the Beers list
      and the intended recipient is over 65 years of age, a synchronous alert (i.e. a ""pop-up"")
      will inform the physician about the risks associated with the medication and will propose
      safer alternatives.

      We will collect data on physician ordering and patient outcomes comparing the number of Beers
      list prescriptions from providers receiving electronic alerts to those not receiving alerts.
      Our anticipated outcome is a decrease in inappropriate prescribing during the period when the
      electronic alerts are activated. Other potential outcomes include decrease in length of stay
      and a decrease in falls.

      Specific Aims: The primary objective of this registry is to determine the percentage of
      patients who are free from atrial fibrillation (AF) at 6 and 12 months following a surgical
      ablation procedure when the patient has a history of failing one or more previous catheter

NCT01035190,Efficacy and Safety of Inhaled Budesonide in Very Preterm Infants at Risk for Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia,"
      HYPOTHESIS:

      Early prophylactic inhalation of Budesonide reduces the absolute risk of developing
      bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) or death in preterm infants born <28 weeks gestational age
      (GA) by 10%.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      To determine whether inhalation of Budesonide within 12 hours of life improves survival
      without BPD at 36 weeks GA in infants born between 23 and 27 weeks GA.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      To determine whether prophylactic inhalation of Budesonide affects neurodevelopment at a
      corrected age of 18-22 months in preterm infants; to determine whether inhalation of
      corticosteroids is associated with adverse treatment effects, alters mortality at 36 weeks
      GA, BPD incidence at 36 weeks GA, and the duration of positive pressure respiratory support
      or supplemental oxygen.

      RATIONALE:

      Pre- and postnatal exposure of the developing lung to inflammation is central to the
      development of BPD and the pulmonary inflammatory response in preterms at risk of developing
      BPD is established very early in life. Corticosteroids have antiinflammatory properties and
      early inhalation of corticosteroids may allow for beneficial local effects on the pulmonary
      system prior to the development of a full inflammatory response with a lower risk of
      undesirable systemic side effects.

      STUDY DESIGN:

      Randomised placebo-controlled, multi-centre clinical trial.

      RESEARCH PLAN:

      Within 2 years 850 infants of 23-27 weeks GA will be randomised during the first 12 hours of
      life to Budesonide or placebo to prevent BPD. Study drugs will be administered via
      Aerochamber and continued until infants are either off supplementary oxygen and positive
      pressure support or have reached a GA of 32 0/7 weeks regardless of ventilatory status. The
      primary outcome of survival without BPD will be determined at 36 weeks GA and BPD will be
      defined according to the physiological definition. Study patients will be followed and
      neurodevelopmental outcomes will be assessed at a corrected age of 18-22 months.

      CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE:

      BPD not only contributes to the mortality of preterm infants but is also associated with
      impaired neurosensory development in Extremely Low Birth Weight (ELBW) survivors, frequent
      readmission to hospital in the first 2 years of life, as well as with an increased risk of
      asthma, lung function abnormalities and persistent respiratory symptoms in adolescence and
      young adulthood. Systemic corticosteroids are effective in preventing BPD, but their use is
      practically prohibited given their adverse effects on neurodevelopment. Early inhalation of
      corticosteroids has been shown to be associated with secondary pulmonary benefits, but its
      effect on survival without BPD and on neurodevelopment remains unclear.

      - The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) uses a standardized set of procedures to
      develop a pool of potential participants for research studies. Because some of the data
      collected during screening are used later for research, the screening itself is considered a
      study. An applicant to any NIDA study is considered a participant in NIDA screening.

      Objectives:

      - To identify, recruit, and screen participants for NIDA research protocols.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals 18 years of age and older who are able to provide informed consent.

      Design:

        -  Individuals who are eligible for screening will undergo two interviews: a telephone
           interview and an in-person interview. The phone interview will determine eligibility for
           the in-person interview.

        -  The in-person interview may require up to five visits to NIDA. The in-person visit will
           involve any or all of the following procedures: (1) full physical examination and
           medical history; (2) psychiatric interview; (3) psychological testing; (4)

NCT01038050,Study Effects of Ginkgo Biloba Extract on Endothelial Cell Function and Genetic Effects on the Response to Ginkgo Biloba Extract in Diabetic Patients With Stable Coronary Artery Disease,"
      Type 2 diabetes is associated with a markedly increased risk for atherosclerotic coronary
      arteries and cerebrovascular diseases. The major cause of death in diabetic patients is
      cardiovascular disease in the world including Taiwan. Atherosclerosis is a progressive
      disease characterized by the response of the vessel wall to chronic, multifactorial injury,
      which leads ultimately to the formation of atheromatous or fibrous plaques. Endothelial
      dysfunction is thought to be the initial stage of atherosclerosis. Endothelial dysfunction
      leads to impaired control of vascular tone, a decreased in the release of anti-inflammatory
      factors and reduced availability of nitric oxide. Endothelial dysfunction portends diabetic
      vasculopathy. The loss of intact endothelial integrity and function sets in motion a cascade
      of serial events that lead to atherosclerosis and cardiovascular complications.

      The standard extracts of G. biloba leaves [G. biloba extract (GBE)] are now demonstrated the
      cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and neuroprotective effects. The mixture of biologically
      active ingredients in GBE accounts for the pleiotropic effects, including antioxidant
      effects, inhibition of platelet aggregation and thromboxane B2 production, vasodilation and
      modulation of cholesterol metabolism. Clinically, GBE was widely used in management of
      vertigo、dementia and improving peripheral circulation. In our previous study, ginkgo biloba
      extract inhibits tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced reactive oxygen species generation,
      transcription factor activation, and cell adhesion molecule expression in human aortic
      endothelial cells. In addition, the similar benefit of prevention atherosclerosis was also
      found in animal study.

      disease and also a rate-limiting enzyme in heme degradation, leading to the generation of
      free iron, biliverdin, and carbon monoxide (CO). CO exerts potent antiproliferative and
      anti-inflammatory effects in the vascular walls, thereby influencing neointimal formation
      after vascular injury. In addition, biliverdin is subsequently metabolized to bilirubin by
      the enzyme biliverdin reductase. Therefore, induction of HO-1 elicits potent
      anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative, antithrombotic, and antioxidant effects in the
      circulation via the generation of CO and bilirubin. Interestingly, recent study found that a
      long guanidine thymidine dinucleotide repeat [(GT) n≧ 30] in the HO-1 promotor, which is
      linked to impaired inducibility, is associated with a higher frequency of vascular access
      failure.

      In the present study, we will investigate the effect of GBE on recovering endothelial
      dysfunction and inflammation in diabetic patients with stable coronary artery disease. In
      particularly, we intend to determine whether the GBE modulates the HO-1 expression and
      investigate whose genotyping including some candidate gene about atherosclerosis and
      hypertension will have most therapeutic effect of GBE.

NCT01038492,p16 Methylation for Smoking Cessation,"
      Smoking cessation is often difficult for smokers to achieve for a variety of reasons
      including: difficulty with nicotine withdrawal, failure to perceive the benefits of smoking
      cessation, and failure to perceive the risks associated with smoking. We argue that the most
      effective biomarkers to affect perceptions of harm, especially for lung cancer, are those
      that signal progression towards disease development Proposed is a pilot study of educating
      smokers about the role of genetics and lung cancer in Durham VA out-patient clinics. The goal
      of this pilot study is to assess the interest in study participation from the VA smoking
      population, as well as to determine the fraction of subjects who will complete the study to
      power a future larger trial. Interested patients will receive a 15 minute educational
      presentation on the function of p16 and its role in development of lung cancer. They will
      then be assessed for airway obstruction by hand-held spirometry followed by review of a
      questionnaire assessing their understanding of the presented information, their concern for
      developing lung cancer, and their desire to quit smoking. All patients will be offered
      smoking cessation assistance at this point. Enrolled patients will then be given 3 sputum
      cups to take home and return with morning sputum samples by mail. Samples will be assessed
      for evidence of p16 methylation and patients will be informed of the results. Follow-up phone
      interviews will be performed at 2 to 4 weeks after patients have received their results by
      mail to assess their understanding of the results, and their desire to stop smoking. A final
      phone interview will occur approximately 3 months after the sputum testing to assess attempts
      to stop smoking as well as the patients continued understanding of their test results. For
      purposes of this pilot, we are interested primarily in the descriptive statistics (e.g.,
      frequencies) associated with the outcome of each objective (e.g., how many expressed
      interest, how many returned the sputum samples).

NCT01038882,Randomized Study With Midazolam for Sedation in Flexible Bronchoscopy,"
      The Flexible Bronchoscopy (FB) is a diagnostic and therapeutic procedure which is not usually
      tolerated by the patient. This makes the examination more difficult and a repetition of the
      examination, if necessary, resulting in a lower diagnostic performance.

      Furthermore, there is nowadays little information with a highly obvious level about the
      relationship between sedation and the patient´s satisfaction with the FB.

      Midazolam is one of the most commonly used sedatives at the beginning for its rapid onset
      property and brief duration of action with sedatives, anxiolytics and amnesia properties.

      The principal aim of our study is to analyse if the use of a local anaesthetic with midazolam
      whilst performing an FB improves the quality of examination in terms of tolerance for the
      patient. It would also be of interest to know if there is an improvement in the acceptance of
      a second or further FB and if this improves the satisfaction of the Bronchoscopist as far as
      the examination performed is concerned.

NCT01039441,The Effect of Local Anesthesia and Simple Maneuver on Shoulder Pain After Gynecologic Laparoscopy,"
      This prospective, randomized controlled trial was designed to compare the efficacy of a
      simple maneuver using lower airway pressure (30 cm H2O) and intraperitoneal instillation of
      bupivacaine, alone or in combination, to reduce shoulder pain after gynecologic laparoscopy.

      Patient aged 15-65 years, scheduled for laparoscopic surgery for benign adnexa disease will
      be eligible for the study. Patients will be excluded from analysis if the procedure requires
      conversion to a laparotomy, an operative time > 3 hours, or interpretation of pain is
      impossible due to serious adverse effects

      240 patients will be randomly assigned to one of four groups Upon completion of surgery, the
      patient is placed in the Trendelenburg position (30 degrees), and one of four procedures is
      followed. For group A (control), 50 ml of normal saline is instilled under the diaphragm and
      CO2 is removed by manual deflation of the abdominal cavity through the cannula; For group B,
      a mixture of 50ml solution (20ml of 0.5% bupivacaine + 30ml normal saline) is instilled under
      the diaphragm and CO2 is removed by manual deflation of the abdominal cavity through the
      cannula; For group C, 50 ml of normal saline is instilled under diaphragm and CO2 was removed
      by means of a pulmonary recruitment maneuver consisting of five manual inflations of the lung
      with a maximum pressure of 30 cm H2O. The anesthesiologist holds the fifth positive pressure
      inflation for approximately 5 seconds. During these maneuvers, the surgeon will be instructed
      to ensure that the trocar sleeve valve is fully open to allow the CO2 gas to escape. For
      group D, patients receive an instillation of a mixture of 50ml solution in combination with
      the clinical maneuver.

      Patients will be given a questionnaire with the pain question represented as a visual analog
      scale (VAS) preoperatively. Patients will be asked to fill out the questionnaires during the
      first 24 hours after surgery to determine the frequency and severity of their shoulder pain.
      All patients are instructed to record the pain scores regarding their shoulder pain only. The
      degree of postoperative shoulder pain will be assessed using VAS at 1, 6, 12, and 24 hours
      postoperatively. The VAS, with scores ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (excruciating pain), is
      constructed without numeration, thus allowing patients to mark a point along the scale that
      best represented their pain at that time.

      In addition, the following parameters are recorded on the case report form by the
      investigators: operative time, blood loss, the length of hospital stay, analgesic use, and
      incidence of postoperative events.

      blood and urine levels of inositol in premature infants at high risk for retinopathy of
      prematurity (ROP) following repeated doses of inositol. Based on previous studies, the
      premise is that maintaining inositol concentrations similar to those occurring naturally in
      utero will reduce the rates of ROP and bronchopulmonary dysplasia in premature infants. The
      objective is to evaluate pharmacokinetics, safety, and clinical outcomes of multiple doses of
      three different dose amounts of myo-inositol (provided by Abbott Laboratories) in very low
      birth weight premature infants. This study will enroll an estimated 96 infants at 17 NICHD

      After surgical treatment, numerous trials using early postoperative enteral or parenteral
      nutritional support have been attempted, in order to reduce morbidity and mortality. Although
      it is difficult to compare among heterogeneous interventions, most of them have not been
      successful, a fact generally attributed to the timing of the intervention. On the other hand,
      nutrients that become ""conditionally essential"" under certain stressful circumstances, the so
      called nutraceuticals, have been incorporated into nutritional formulations. Both facts have
      prompted the idea of pre or perioperative nutrition support, using specific formulations
      called ""immune enhancing"" formulas, containing arginine, nucleotides, glutamine and omega3
      fatty acids in varying concentrations. The provision of these nutraceuticals prior and early
      after the surgical, and particularly in oncologic surgery, theoretically permits to obtain
      adequate circulating and tissue concentrations for the moment when they are most needed.
      Exclusive postoperative provision of these substances would not be able to replenish depots
      and provide them for an adequate immune response and wound healing after surgery. However,
      regarding the preoperative approach, it is still not know which patients benefit more (less
      or more severely malnourished), which specific nutrient(s) are responsible for the positive
      effects, and the precise timing these nutrients should be provided. The present study aims to
      demonstrate that immune-enhancing formulas are superior to standard enteral products in
      reducing postoperative nutrition-related complications.

      approach uses education, nutrition, exercise, and time management training, and another uses
      mindfulness meditation and yoga, which is taught as part of the Mindfulness-based stress
      reduction (MBSR) course, an 8-week manualized mindfulness intervention. We hypothesize that
      the two approaches will reduce anxiety in individuals with GAD in different ways. We will
      measure changes in stress hormones associated with these changes.

NCT01034020,Effects of Nicotine on Elements of Attentions in Smokers and Nonsmokers,"
      Background:

      - Many cigarette smokers claim that smoking helps them stay alert and improves their
      concentration, and have reported problems in attention and concentration after quitting
      smoking. Some research has indicated that nicotine can enhance certain aspects of attention
      and memory in humans. However, more research is needed to determine how nicotine affects
      different elements of the brain's ability to pay attention. Knowing which aspects of
      attention are affected by nicotine may help produce new medications and therapies to help
      people successfully stop smoking.

      Objectives:

        -  To investigate the dose-related effects of nicotine on the ability to pay attention in
           smokers and nonsmokers.

        -  To compare the effects of nicotine in smokers and nonsmokers.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals between 18 and 50 years of age who are either current smokers (at least 15
      cigarettes per day on average for at least 2 years) or healthy, nonsmoking volunteers.

      Design:

        -  The study will consist of one training session and three testing sessions. Each session
           will last about 2 hours.

        -  The training session will introduce participants to the study tests and evaluate their
           tolerance of the two levels of nicotine nasal spray used in the study. Smokers will
           receive the higher dose of nicotine to introduce them to the effects of the spray.
           Nonsmokers will be given first the lower dose of the spray, followed by higher dose at
           least 30 minutes later. Nonsmoking participants who cannot tolerate the higher dose will
           not continue in the study.

        -  At the start of each testing session, smokers will have one cigarette to standardize the
           time of the most recent exposure to nicotine.

        -  During the testing sessions, participants will receive a placebo spray, a lower dose of
           nicotine, or a higher dose of nicotine, and then will be asked to perform tests that
           evaluate mood, attention, and performance.

NCT01031316,Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA) Screening Trial,"
      The ductus arteriosus directs blood away from the pulmonary circulation and toward the
      systemic circulation during fetal life, then closes after birth. In preterm infants the
      incidence of spontaneous closure decreases with gestational age. Patent ductus arteriosus
      (PDA) increases the risks of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and necrotizing enterocolitis
      (NEC). However, this association may not be a causal relationship.

      Echocardiography is required to diagnose PDA. However, routine screening echocardiograms lead
      to detection of asymptomatic PDAs, for which the benefit of therapy remains unproven.

      A randomized controlled trial has been designed in which 88 infants with birth weight less
      than or equal to 1250 grams and gestational age less than or equal to 30 weeks will be
      enrolled. The investigators' goal is to determine how screening echocardiography influences

NCT01033513,SOS Nutrition Project,"
      Many older people experience hyperlipidemia and hypertension, but, to date, there is little
      information regarding whether or not medical nutrition therapy (MNT) or therapeutic meals
      have an independent or joint beneficial impact on older people with these diagnoses. This
      report describes a clinical trial in which the investigators directly examined these issues.
      Two key clinical outcome measures include changes in diastolic blood pressure and total
      fasting serum cholesterol. In addition to these clinical outcome measures the investigators
      collected health related quality of life data and data that permitted cost-effectiveness
      analyses.

      The investigators hypothesized that MNT and therapeutic meals would each lead to lower total
      fasting serum cholesterol and lower diastolic blood pressure after the 52-week trial, in
      comparison to individuals who received standard support (commonly available literature on how
      to manage their disease). The investigators also hypothesized that MNT plus therapeutic meals
      would be especially beneficial because of their synergistic effects on the clinical outcomes.
      Although the investigators established no specific hypotheses regarding the potential impact
      of MNT or therapeutic meals on cost of care and quality adjusted life years, the
      investigators were interested in whether MNT or therapeutic meals would be associated with

NCT01031121,Breath Carbon Monoxide and Cotinine as Biomarkers to Distinguish Smokers From Nonsmokers,"
      Background:

        -  Self-report and biochemical verification are used to determine smoking status in
           treatment trials and clinical research. Each method has merits and limitations that make
           it appropriate for particular situations. Participants who feel social pressure to
           report tobacco abstinence may provide unreliable self-reporting results. Biochemical
           verification using breath carbon monoxide (CO) is a more reliable indicator, but several
           biological and environmental factors (including exposure to secondhand smoke) can affect
           the sensitivity and specificity of breath CO measurement.

        -  An ideal biomarker of smoking status is cotinine, the major metabolite of nicotine.
           Cotinine levels found in blood, urine, and saliva can be used to distinguish between
           smokers and nonsmokers, as well as between light and heavy smokers. Researchers are
           interested in using cotinine assessments to develop suitable breath CO cutoff levels to
           categorize different types of smokers and nonsmokers for use in future research.

      Objectives:

      - To determine a breath carbon monoxide (CO) cutoff level that optimally discriminates
      between heavy and light smokers and nonsmokers who are and who are not exposed to
      environmental tobacco smoke.

      Eligibility:

        -  Individuals between 18 and 64 years of age who fall into one of the following groups:

        -  current smokers reporting more than 10 cigarettes per day for at least 6 months

        -  current smokers reporting 10 or fewer cigarettes per day for at least 6 months

        -  nonsmokers reporting regular environmental exposure to tobacco smoke

        -  nonsmokers reporting limited or no exposure to tobacco smoke

      Design:

        -  The study will involve a single outpatient session.

        -  Participants will provide breath CO, urine, and saliva samples, and will complete
           several smoking-related questionnaires on smoking history, current craving levels, and

NCT01033201,"Alveoscopy, Endoscopic Confocal Microscopy and Lung Rejection, Parenchymal Lung Diseases in Vivo","
      Lung transplantation is indicated when end-stage lung diseases no longer respond to available
      standard therapy, making life expectancy short and associated with disability. Acute and
      chronic rejection are common complications following transplantation, indicating screening
      bronchoscopies and transbronchial biopsies at three month intervals the first two years, in
      addition to clinically indicated procedures when rejection or infection is suspected.
      Transbronchial biopsies carry associated risks (bleeding, pneumothorax). Chronic rejection is
      characterized by progressive obliteration of distal airways (Bronchiolitis Obliterans-BO-).
      BO requires open lung biopsy for diagnosis. Alternatively, a clinical surrogate
      (Bronchiolitis Obliterans Syndrome), characterized by decline in Forced Expired Volume in 1
      second not explained by acute rejection or infection is used for diagnosis. The new technique
      of confocal endo-microscopy enables sub-surface visualization of tissue in vivo during
      bronchoscopic procedures using a probe-based confocal microscope, integrated to a standard
      endoscope. Bronchiolar and alveolar structures can be visualized at a cellular and nuclear
      level, and these images can be saved and reviewed. This new technology could potentially
      identify acute and chronic rejection, thus offering and alternative to transbronchial
      biopsies. We expect to describe a new alternative to diagnose acute and chronic rejection
      using confocal microscopy images obtained endoscopically, obviating complications of
      transbronchial biopsies.

      Endoscopic confocal endomicroscopy can detect and classify common bronchiolar and alveolar
      pathological conditions in real time. Specifically, we hypothesize that confocal
      endomicroscopy images of bronchiolar and alveolar structures during standard bronchoscopy
      could help to recognize and classify the presence/absence of acute rejection and/or
      bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome in lung transplant recipients. This technology could also
      identify the histological characteristics lung diseases such as interstitial, obstructive or
      vascular end stage lung diseases, and thus lead to more efficient, safer and more accurate
      diagnosis of these lung conditions during routine bronchoscopies.

      It is essential that anaesthetists successfully perform orotracheal intubation in scenarios
      in which intubation is potentially more difficult, such as where the neck is immobilized.

      The Airtraq® Laryngoscope and the CMAC are new intubating devices. They are designed to
      provide a view of the glottis without alignment of the oral, pharyngeal and tracheal axes.

      These devices may be especially effective in situations where intubation of the trachea is
      potentially difficult.

      The efficacy of these devices in comparison to the traditional Macintosh laryngoscope in
      situations where the cervical spine is immobilized is not known.

      The investigators aim to compare the performances of the Airtraq® Laryngoscope and the CMAC
      to that of the Macintosh laryngoscope, the gold standard device, in patients in which the
      cervical spine has been immobilized by means of a Manual in-line stabilization of the spine.

      Hypothesis: The primary hypothesis is that, in the hands of experienced anaesthetists, time
      to intubation would be shorter using the indirect laryngoscopes, than using the Macintosh

      Females who participate in cutting and landing sports suffer anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)
      injuries at a 2 to 10-fold greater rate than males participating in the same high-risk
      sports. Fifty to 100 percent of ACL injured females will suffer osteoarthritis of the injured
      knee within one to two decades of the injury. External knee abduction moment (LOAD) predicts
      ACL injury with high sensitivity and specificity in female athletes. Control of lateral trunk
      motion (LTM) also predicts ACL injury with similar levels of sensitivity and specificity in
      female athletes. These predictors may be linked, as lateral positioning of the trunk can
      create high knee abduction load via both biomechanical and neuromuscular mechanisms. The
      mechanism of ACL injury in females include high knee LOAD and high LTM, with the majority of
      body weight shifted over the injured limb and the foot positioned lateral to the body's
      center of mass. An unanticipated perturbation is also often a contributor to the injury
      mechanism. LTM may result in increased knee LOAD by increasing the lateral position and
      magnitude of the GRF vector (ΔGRFv) or by increasing reactive hip adductor torque (HAdT). Our
      long-term objectives are to determine the mechanisms that cause ACL injury in female athletes
      and to develop neuromuscular training (NMT) interventions that specifically target these
      mechanisms. If the objectives of this proposal are achieved, an evidence-based NMT
      intervention will be developed and made available nationally that will effectively and
      efficiently reduce ACL injury risk in high-risk female athletes. The major goal of this
      proposal is to determine if increased LTM increases coronal plane knee load in high-risk

      improve physical functioning in older adults who are overweight or obese and sedentary.
      However, the mechanisms by which weight change and exercise influence physical functioning
      and sarcopenia remain largely understudied. ions). In the WL+E group, participants attended a
      group-based weight management session plus three supervised exercise sessions each week
      throughout the entire study. During each exercise session, participants engaged in both
      aerobic activities (i.e., walking) and lower body resistance training of moderate intensity.
      The participants in the educational control group attended monthly health education lectures
      on topics relevant to older adults. It was hypothesized that participants assigned to the
      WL+E intervention would 1) lose a larger amount of weight, 2) improve their physical function
      levels, and 3) reduce levels of oxidative stress and inflammation to a greater degree than
      participants assigned to the Educational Control group. Outcomes are: 1) body weight, 2)
      walking speed (assessed by 400 meter walk test), 3) the Short Physical Performance Battery
      [SPPB], and 4) knee extension isokinetic strength. The objectives of this pilot study are
      fourfold: 1) to demonstrate the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of the proposed WL+E
      intervention in a sample of 40 sedentary, obese older adults with impaired physical
      functioning; 2) to examine the biological effects of the intervention on inflammatory
      processes, oxidative stress, apoptosis, sarcopenia, muscle and body composition, muscle
      strength, and functional performance; 3) to determine whether the expected beneficial effects
      of the WL+E intervention on physical functioning are mediated by changes in inflammation,
      apoptosis, and sarcopenia; and 4) to determine the effect size of the WL+E intervention on
      key outcomes and provide the basis for sample size calculations in the planning of a larger
      RCT.

NCT01031290,Pilot Study Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) in Cannabis Craving,"
      Background:

        -  Cannabis, also known as marijuana, is a commonly abused drug. There is no approved
           medication to treat cannabis addiction. The desire to use cannabis often increases when
           seeing others use it or seeing pictures of it. Researchers are interested in determining
           which parts of the brain are active when looking at pictures associated with cannabis.

        -  Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) uses magnetic pulses to stimulate
           the brain. These pulses can change activity in parts of the brain. Researchers are
           interested in determining whether rTMS can decrease activity in the parts of the brain
           that respond to cannabis, and thereby lessen cravings for cannabis.

      Objectives:

      - To determine whether transcranial magnetic stimulation can lower craving for cannabis when
      people who use cannabis are shown images that increase craving.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals 18 years of age and older who are physically healthy and currently use cannabis
      (at least 3 times weekly for the past 2 years).

      Design:

        -  The study will involve eight visits over 3 weeks, with each visit lasting 1 to 2 hours.

        -  Participants will have an initial assessment about cannabis use and provide blood and
           urine samples before beginning the study.

        -  Participants will have three magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans. The first MRI
           scan will look at the structure of the brain at rest. During the other two scans,
           participants will look at images related to and not related to cannabis use.

        -  The rTMS sessions (with either actual TMS or inactive [sham] TMS) will be held daily for
           5 consecutive days. During these testing visits, researchers will ask questions related
           to drug use and craving, and collect urine and breath samples for further study.

      Background:

        -  Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a group of developmental disorders that affect
           communication, social interaction, and behavior. Relatively little is known about the
           relationship between genetics and behavior among these individuals and their close
           relatives. Researchers are interested in using interviews and rating scales to better
           understand these issues, as well as collecting brain scan data and genetic samples for
           testing and comparison.

        -  By comparing test results and genetic samples from healthy volunteers, people with ASD,

NCT01031433,Assessment of Craving in Nicotine-Dependent Patients With Schizophrenia Using Virtual Reality,"
      Background:

        -  The prevalence of cigarette smoking among individuals with schizophrenia is noticeably
           higher than in the general population, and smoking cessation attempts frequently are
           unsuccessful in this population. Little is known about the effects of cigarette/nicotine
           craving in individuals with schizophrenia. Researchers are interested in learning more
           about how craving affects people with schizophrenia and developing new ways to treat
           cravings and improve the effectiveness of smoking cessation therapies and treatments.

        -  In recent years, virtual reality (VR) has been studied to determine whether it can be
           used to induce craving by using life-like cue settings. VR cues involving cigarette use,
           including images of cigarettes and scent cues of tobacco smoke, may be used to elicit
           craving in smokers. Researchers are interested in learning more about how individuals
           with schizophrenia respond to specific VR cues and settings.

      Objectives:

        -  To determine the feasibility of using a contextual real-world paradigm using virtual
           reality involving cigarette smoking in people with schizophrenia.

        -  To examine if virtual reality cues will elicit craving in smokers with schizophrenia.

      Eligibility:

      - Current smokers (five or more cigarettes per day for at least 1 year) between 18 and 45
      years of age who have been diagnosed with schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder.

      Design:

        -  The study will involve three sessions, with an initial screening visit, a test session,
           and a follow-up session.

        -  Screening visit: Participants will be screened with a medical and psychiatric history,
           and will answer questions about smoking history, current smoking habits and craving
           patterns, and general anxiety levels. This session will also introduce participants to
           the operation and use of the VR equipment. Participants who are comfortable using the VR
           system will return within 2 days for the test session.

        -  Test session: Participants will use the VR equipment to view neutral scenes and scenes
           that are designed to elicit cravings for cigarettes. After viewing each scene,
           participants will answer questions about their overall mood, anxiety levels, and any
           cigarette cravings they may have.

        -  Follow-up session: Participants will return 1 week after the VR session to answer
           questions about mood, anxiety levels, and current smoking habits and craving patterns.

NCT01032434,"An 8-week, Open-label Study to Evaluate the Effect of Sertraline on Polysomnogram in Depressive Patients With Insomnia","
      Major depressive disorder is associated with several sleep Polysomnograph (PSG) findings: (1)
      impaired sleep continuity; (2) non-REM (NREM) changes; and (3) enhanced rapid eye movement
      (REM) sleep. The first two patterns are common in other psychiatric disorders, while the REM
      pattern is very characteristic in depression, so the phase-advance theory was accepted by
      most of psychiatrists. Many researchers have focused on the biological rhythm to investigate
      the etiological and pathophysiology of depression, and they think depression can be cured if
      its sleep abnormality is ameliorated.

      It is well known that most of antidepressants treat depression through 5-hydroxytryptamine
      (5-HT) neurons. 5-HT also affects the regulation of the sleep-wake cycle and the sleep
      microarchitecture. Many all-night PSG studies have shown tricyclic antidepressants can
      ameliorate the sleep architecture abnormality in depression by producing rapid suppression of
      REM sleep.

      Compared to TCAs, SSRIs are generally less sedating because of its high selectivity for
      serotonin receptors. SSRIs can suppress REM sleep and delay REM latency too, but they
      increase awakenings and reduce SWS at the same time. One PSG study shown sertraline minimally
      increases sleep efficiency and reduces nocturnal wakefulness time, which may benefit
      depressive patients. However, this study compared the sleep architecture before and after 12
      weeks of pharmacotherapy, so the tolerance to the disturbance of sleep architecture in
      antidepressants appears to develop over several weeks of treatment. Sertraline has a greater
      potency against 5-HT reuptake as well as better selectivity for 5-HT reuptake relative to NE
      reuptake than any other SSRIs, and the relative selectivity of sertraline for inhabiting 5-HT
      reuptake relative to DA reuptake is somewhat less than of any other SSRIs. So it has chance
      to exhibit better effect on sleep architecture in depressive patients.

      Finally, it is difficult to be determined that the unique phenomenon of sertraline is its
      genuine characteristics or the tolerance after 12-week treatment, so it is crucial to assess
      the effect of sertraline on sleep architecture in acute treatment. We hypothesized that
      sertraline could suppress the REM sleep, and have little damage to the sleep architecture of
      depressive patient.

      Background:

      Despite the well-known benefits of exercise, 64% of the Swiss population do not fulfill the
      public health recommendation of physical activity. A survey of female staff members over 45
      years of age from the University Hospital Zurich at the end of 2003 showed that physical
      inactivity is also prevalent in this population.

      Aim:

      To assess whether inactive women working at a large hospital centre prefer Nordic Walking
      (NW) or a Jogging (J) as a health promotion strategy. (2) To test whether the method chosen
      by the majority improves physical performance, physical activity, body weight and
      composition, and bone mineral density.

      Methods: The investigators will send out a questionnaire to all female staff members at a
      large hospital centre age 45 and older, ask whether they are inactive, and whether they
      prefer Nordic Walking or Jogging as a health promotion strategy. Depending on the preference
      of the majority of the women, the investigators will then ask inactive female staff members
      age 45+ to participate in a 12-months randomized controlled trial comparing training plus
      nutrition education to nutrition education alone. The training will have a 3-month
      building-up phase followed up by an in part unsupervised training of 9 months. All
      participants will receive a lecture on healthy nutrition once a months for 12 months. The
      investigators will assess diet with a food frequency questionnaire at baseline and after 12
      and 24 months.

      The primary endpoint is: physical performance, measured with the 12-minute Coopertest.

      The secondary endpoints are: level of physical activity, body mass index, body composition
      and bone mineral density at the spine and the hip.

      Importance: This project will address the questions which physical activities are preferred
      by inactive women and whether the preferred training improves physical performance, physical
      activity, body mass index, body composition and bone mineral density. In addition, our study
      will explore whether those women who changed their diet in addition to being randomized to

NCT01030887,PEACH Trial: Prescribed Exercise After Chemotherapy,"
      Many cancer survivors suffer symptoms such as fatigue and dyspnea which may persist for years
      or months after their chemotherapy has finished. Despite the known benefits of exercise and
      its potential to address many of the symptoms after cancer, the type of practical exercise
      programme which best suits this population is not known.

      Many exercise programmes performed in cancer survivors take place over many weeks or months
      and include people with specific types of cancer. Such programmes may therefore not be
      suitable for the majority of cancer survivors and would pose serious practical difficulties
      with high drop-out rates and expensive resource consumption if they were extended into
      clinical practice.

NCT01035060,"Blood Flow, Muscle Regeneration and Sarcopenia","
      Due to the rapid aging of the population, sarcopenia is among the greatest challenges facing
      the health care system over the next quarter century. This age-related loss of skeletal
      muscle mass and strength directly contributes to the incidence of functional disability,
      thereby reducing independence and quality of life for the elderly. Despite increasing efforts
      to combat sarcopenia, its etiology remains incompletely described. Subsequently, limited
      progress has been made in developing comprehensive preventative and therapeutic strategies to
      combat the problem. A decreased ability to regenerate skeletal muscle fibers through the
      donation of skeletal muscle stem cells (satellite cells) is thought to contribute to
      sarcopenia. However, the upstream physiological mediators that regulate this impairment are
      poorly delineated.

      Reduced muscle blood flow in advanced age appears to be a significant factor in reducing
      skeletal muscle regenerative capacity, but few data exist to confirm this hypothesis. Thus to
      test this hypothesis we aim to conduct a translational pilot trial which examines
      regeneration in both young and old adults. Furthermore, we aim to determine if muscle blood
      flow and satellite cell number are associated with muscle function. The central hypothesis of
      this proposal is that age-related declines in skeletal muscle angiogenesis and perfusion are
      significant causal factors in age-related losses of skeletal muscle mass. The specific aims
      and hypotheses of the project are as follows:

      - Relapse following cigarette abstinence remains a common problem for smokers who are
      attempting to quit. Most research has focused on the acute withdrawal phase that occurs
      within the first 48 hours to 1 week after quitting; however, more information is needed on
      the experiences of smokers in longer durations of abstinence.

      Objectives:

        -  To study the effects of long-term smoking abstinence.

        -  To study the effects of cigarette-related cues on craving in longer periods of smoking
           abstinence.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who are current smokers (at least 10 cigarettes per
      day) and who want to quit but are not currently attempting to quit.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be randomly assigned to abstain from all nicotine use for 7, 14, or 35
           days. A fourth group of participants will also abstain for 35 days, but will undergo
           more testing sessions than the other groups.

        -  All participants will have an initial orientation session in which they will complete
           questionnaires about their smoking habits and will respond to smoking-related cues to
           provide information about their cravings.

        -  Participants will visit the clinic daily during their abstinence period, and provide
           urine and breath samples to test for tobacco use. Participants will receive compensation
           for every day that they do not use tobacco.

        -  On the end day of the abstinence period, participants will return to the clinic, provide
           urine and breath samples, and undergo testing of their responses to smoking-related
           cues. Participants in the fourth group will have these tests on Days 7, 14, and 35 of
           abstinence; other participants will have the tests only once, at the end of their
           abstinence period.

        -  After the required abstinence period, participants will enter a 5-day step-down period.
           They will continue to report to the clinic for breath and urine testing, and they will
           receive payments for abstinence that decrease in value across days.

        -  After the step-down period, for the final 12 days of the study, participants will report
           to the clinic every 3 days to give urine and breath samples and to report the number of

NCT01036685,Cognitive Task Development and Implementation for Functional MRI Studies,"
      Background:

        -  Drugs of abuse have effects on mood, behavior, thinking, and decision making that may
           encourage people to continue using them and make it difficult for them to stop.
           Researchers who study these effects are interested in developing new tests to evaluate
           how drugs and drug use affect different areas of the brain.

        -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans allow researchers to study brain activity and
           changes to brain function. When specific psychological tests are performed during
           functional MRI (fMRI) scans, researchers can examine the effects of drug use on the
           brain. By developing and testing new procedures for fMRI studies, more information can
           be obtained on brain function and activity in drug-using and non-drug-using individuals,
           and this information can help develop new treatments and therapies for substance abuse.

      Objectives:

      - To evaluate the effects of newly developed psychological procedures to be performed during
      fMRI scans.

      Eligibility:

           scanning.

        -  Both drug-using and non-drug-using individuals will be selected for this study.

      Design:

        -  Before the start of the study, participants will complete questionnaires about medical
           and psychological history, and provide information about past or current drug use.
           Researchers will introduce the tasks to be performed during the scanning session(s), and
           will allow participants to practice the test either on a separate computer or on the
           computer used during the MRI scan.

        -  During the study, participants will be asked to do one or more tasks selected by the
           researchers. The tasks will be performed on a computer in an MRI machine, and may
           involve receiving rewards (such as money or sips of juice) for actions, memory and

      - Many cigarette smokers claim that smoking improves their ability to think and concentrate,
      and have reported problems in thinking and concentration after quitting smoking. Some
      research has indicated that nicotine can enhance certain aspects of attention and memory in
      humans. However, more research is needed to determine how nicotine affects different elements
      of the brain s ability to think, pay attention, respond to rewards, and make decisions.
      Researchers are interested in using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study the
      effects of nicotine on brain function and activity.

      Objectives:

      - To determine the effects of nicotine on attentional and other thinking processes, including
      reward-seeking behavior.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals between 18 and 50 years of age who are either current smokers (10 or more
      cigarettes per day for at least 1 year) or nonsmokers.

      Design:

        -  The study has four experiments. Each experiment requires two MRI scanning sessions and a
           training session. Participant can do one or all of the experiments.

        -  Participants will receive training on the types of computerized tests that will be given
           during the active portion of the study. Participants will also fill out questionnaires
           on nicotine use and other alcohol and drug use, and provide breath and urine samples.

        -  During the test sessions, participants will have fMRI scanning while performing up to
           four different sets of tasks that test attention, memory, concentration, reward-seeking
           behavior, and decision making. Smokers will wear a nicotine patch or placebo patch
           during the test sessions, but will not be told which patch they are receiving. The order
           of these sessions will be different for individual participants.

NCT01036841,Influence of Food-intake on Desmopressin Oral Tablets and MELT-formulation,"
      Alarm-treatment as well as Desmopressin, a synthetic analogue of human vasopressin, are
      considered the only evidence-based medicine (EBM) IA treatments in monosymptomatic nocturnal
      enuresis (MNE). Desmopressin exists in three different formulations for ambulant use: nasal
      spray, tablet and lyophilisate (MELT) each with differences in bioavailability (spray 2%,
      tablet 0.2%, MELT 0.5%). There 's insufficient evidence to confirm the actually used
      bioequivalent doses ( 10µg spray = 120µg MELT= 0.2mg tablet).

      Although so frequently used, very few pharmacokinetic and -dynamic data on desmopressin are
      available for children.

      Due to prolonged half life, associated with waterintoxication,the nasal spray has a black box
      warning from the FDA and is no longer recommended . For some authors oral formulations appear
      to be a safer alternative. However, based on clinical experience of less response rate with
      oral formulations, lower biodisponibility is suspected. Adult research confirms low
      bioavailability of tablets but also show major influences by food-intake and changes in
      gastro-intestinal motility.

      To achieve maximum efficacy, recommendations are to take desmopressin tablet 1 hour before
      bedtime and 2 hours after meal: this is unrealistic in schoolaged children since there never
      is 3 hours between evening meal and bedtime.

      In 2005 a dose response study demonstrated superior pharmaco-kinetic and dynamic properties
      for desmopressin Lyophilisate MELT formula.

      Since these results implicate superior action of MELT, often a change to MELT is recommended
      if there is a suboptimal response with tablet: sublingual absorption would eliminate the
      influence of food-intake.

      However, for this statement there's no evidence, since these tests were all conducted in
      children in fasting condition. Only one clinical study demonstrates bioequivalence for MELT
      and tablet.

      Hypothesis is that desmopressin MELT formulation has a better bioavailability when
      administered together with meal due to its sublingual absorption.

      There are many anecdotal reports about improvement of Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) with
      cannabis smoking. The most effective anti inflammatory compound known today is cannabidiol.
      cannabidiol can be extracted from the cannabis plant, it has no central effect and is fat
      soluble so it can be given as drops in oil. Doses of up to 500mg did not cause any side
      effects.

      The aim of the proposed study is to examine in a double blind placebo controlled fashion the
      effect of cannabidiol on disease activity in patients with IBD.

NCT01037465,ROS Signaling in Endothelial Function,"
      The vascular endothelium (inner lining of cells in blood vessels) normally prevents vasospasm
      and thrombosis by producing nitric oxide and other regulatory substances. In patients with
      atherosclerosis, endothelial function is impaired. Excess production of reactive oxygen
      species (free radicals) contribute to endothelial dysfunction in atherosclerosis, and some
      prior studies have shown a beneficial effect of antioxidant treatment on endothelial function
      in patients with coronary artery disease. On the other hand, reactive oxygen species may be
      required for normal endothelial function and antioxidant supplements failed to show a benefit
      in large clinical trials. The effect of antioxidant treatment on endothelial function in
      healthy subjects is unknown. The present study will test the hypothesis that scavenging
      reactive species might reduce endothelium-dependent vasodilation in healthy subjects.

      The study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study. Participants
      will receive 2.4 grams of oral NAC or similar-appearing placebo during the first visit, and
      then will cross over to the alternative treatment (NAC or placebo) for the second and final
      visit. We will examine endothelial function before and after treatment on each visit.

NCT01037556,PR104 in Treating Patients With Refractory/Relapsed Acute Leukemia,"
      The current understanding of PR104 justifies the evaluation of PR104 in subjects with
      relapsed/refractory AML and ALL. These include:

        -  Hypoxia. Leukemic bone marrow is likely to demonstrate a level of hypoxia sufficient to
           activate PR104 to its active metabolites PR104H and PR104M.

        -  Myelotoxicity as the primary toxicity at MTD. In prior clinical studies in subjects with
           solid tumors PR104 has demonstrated myelotoxicity as the primary toxicity. This
           observation suggests that PR104 will exert a similar effect on leukemic cells.

        -  AKR1C3. AML has been reported to exhibit high levels of AKR1C3 which should lead to
           selective activation of PR104 within both hypoxic and oxic leukemic cells.

        -  Preclinical data. PR104 has demonstrated impressive activity in an initial study using
           primary human ALL in a mouse model.

      The initial dose finding phase of the study will provide estimates of the activity and
      toxicity of PR104 in subjects with refractory/relapsed AML, and determine the optimal
      individualized dose to give each subject based on his/her covariates (prior CR duration,
      prior number of salvage therapies, age). Once a potentially beneficial dose has been
      determined, an expanded cohort of subjects with AML or ALL will receive PR104 at a uniform
      dose. This information will prove valuable in defining the future clinical development of
      PR104, and in determining if PR104 has sufficient activity and acceptable safety in AML to
      warrant future phase II or phase III studies in this indication.

      Primary objectives

        -  Determine the toxicities and recommended dose of PR104 when administered IV to subjects
           with relapsed/refractory AML and ALL.

NCT01037660,Effects of Lipemia and Metformin on Endothelial Function,"
      Eating a diet high in fat contributes to the development of atherosclerosis (hardening of the
      arteries). Acute fat consumption increases levels of fat in the blood and temporarily reduces
      the ability of blood vessel to dilate (open up to carry additional blood). A similar response
      is observed during infusion of Intra-Lipid (a fat emulsion used for intravenous nutrition).
      The present study is designed to help us understand the effects of a fat load on blood vessel
      function. We will measure arterial dilation using non-invasive techniques before and at the
      end of a 5-hour infusion of Intra-Lipid in healthy subjects. Subjects will then take the
      approved drug metformin for two weeks and return for repeat studies of endothelial function
      with Intra-Lipid infusion. We expect that metformin will help preserve the normal function of
      blood vessels during a fat load. This study will help us understand how fat affects blood
      vessels and therefore will advance our knowledge of the development of atherosclerosis and
      potentially lead to improved methods to prevent and treat heart disease.

NCT01037673,Subacromial Impingement - The Need of Arthroscopic Subacromial Decompression After Eccentric Physical Therapy Exercises,"
      Objective:

      A randomized clinical trial in order to evaluate the efficacy of structured eccentric
      exercises tutored by a physical therapist (PT) for patients with subacromial impingement.

      Hypothesis:

      H1 The exercises has a satisfactory effect and the need of an arthroscopic subacromial
      decompression can be reconsidered.

      H0 No difference between the two exercises (experimental and active control) and the patients
      still need surgery

      Further the study objective is to evaluate predictors for a positive or negative treatment
      response after three months of rehabilitation as well as after 12 months.

      Method:

      Patients referred to the orthopedic unit for an arthroscopic subacromial decompression, are
      offered a three month rehabilitation program during the waiting time for surgery which is
      approximately 4-6 months. All patients must have tried conservative treatments for at least 6
      months in primary care with unsatisfactory results. The patients will be randomized to either
      the structured eccentric exercises tutored by a physical therapist or control exercises with
      general movements for the neck and shoulders. All patients has an equal number of sessions
      with the PT to offer similar attention. After three months the following key-question has to
      be answered: due to your current experience of your shoulder problems do you still need this
      surgical intervention? A blinded orthopedic surgeon evaluates the following outcomes at
      baseline and after three and twelve months. Primary outcomes: Constant-Murley shoulder
      assessment, Disabilities of the Arm Shoulder and Hans and different aspects of pain.
      Secondary outcomes; EQ-5D, sick-leave and return to work. All patients are evaluated with a
      diagnostic ultrasound in order to reveal the condition of the rotator cuff. Also long-term
      results in those who go thorough with the surgery and those who decline will be assessed
      after 12 months.

      Importance of the study results:

      Since there is no consensus about which intervention that should be preferred for patients
      with subacromial impingement the results of the current study is warranted. If this exercise
      program is successful it can be implemented into clinical practice. Further, clinical
      characteristics of patients that really need an arthroscopic subacromial decompression can be
      identified.

      The objective of the project is a test-of-concept of an intervention to reduce the effects of
      the perception of discrimination on the care of patients with chronic illness. Perception of
      discrimination manifests itself as stereotype threat. We hypothesize that stereotype threat
      impairs communication between minority patients and their physicians because of increased
      stress and diminished trust, resulting in interactions that are less successful at enhancing
      patient self-efficacy, in turn resulting in lower rates of adherence with anti-hypertensive
      medication.

      The intervention is a self-affirmation exercise performed prior to a patient-physician visit.
      A similar intervention has been shown to reduce the racial gap in academic performance in
      middle school classrooms.

      We will explore the mechanistic effects of the intervention by analysis of audiotapes of
      patient-provider visits following the intervention. We will measure the effect of the
      intervention on minority hypertensive patients' adherence with antihypertensive medication
      and blood pressure.

      We will enroll 200 African American and Latino patients with hypertension and randomize 100
      patients to perform the exercise and 100 patients to perform a null control exercise before
      the visit. We will assess change in patient's adherence with antihypertensive medications and
      in blood pressure over the six months following the index visit. In order to better

      Background:

      - Central nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are primary targets for the action of
      nicotine. In addition to being involved in tobacco dependence, they are also involved in a
      variety of brain disorders, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Researchers are
      interested in developing better ways to study the action of nAChRs to improve treatments for
      smoking cessation and other problems affected by these receptors. These new study methods may
      involve different approaches to positron emission tomography (PET) scanning, which can show
      brain activity related to nAChRs.

NCT01038362,Effects of Almonds On Endothelial Function In Patients With Coronary Artery Disease,"
      The vascular endothelium (inner lining of cells in blood vessels) normally prevents vasospasm
      and thrombosis by production of a variety of regulatory substances, including nitric oxide.
      In patients with atherosclerosis, these functions of the endothelium are impaired and these
      abnormalities may contribute to the development of heart attack and stroke.

      Observational studies have shown that frequent nut consumption decreases the risk of
      cardiovascular disease (CVD), but the mechanisms of benefit have not been fully defined.
      Recent studies suggest that specific fatty acids and flavonoids in nuts may have favorable
      effects on cardiovascular disease. In addition, there is growing evidence that these
      compounds may improve the function of the endothelium.

      The present study is designed to test the hypothesis that an almond-enriched diet will
      improve the function of the endothelium in patients with coronary artery disease. Subjects
      will be enrolled into a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study that will compare a
      National Cholesterol Education Program Step 1 diet without nuts to a Step 1 diet that has the
      same number of total calories but includes 3 ounces of almonds daily. Participants will
      consume each diet for six weeks with a four-week rest period between diets. The order of
      diets will be randomized (almonds or no almonds). Dietary assessments via food recall
      questionnaires will be employed at the study entry, end of the four week washout period, and
      end of the second intervention. If subjects are drifting from the recommendations of the STEP
      1 diet, counseling will be given to urge compliance. The primary endpoint will be

NCT01038531,Biomarkers of Lung Injury With Low Tidal Volume Ventilation Compared With Airway Pressure Release Ventilation,"
      Acute lung injury (ALI) and the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) represent a
      spectrum of clinical syndromes of rapid respiratory system deterioration that are associated
      with both pulmonary and systemic illness. These syndromes are associated with 30-40%
      mortality with our current standard of care and are responsible for approximately 75,000
      deaths in the US yearly. Current evidence-based care of ALI consists of a strategy of
      mechanical ventilation utilizing low lung volumes (ARDSNet ventilation) intended to limit
      further stretch-induced lung injury exacerbated by the ventilator. However, this strategy has
      been shown to be associated with increased lung injury in a subset of patients and still is
      associated with about a 30% mortality rate. Airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) is a
      different, non-experimental strategy of mechanical ventilation currently in routine clinical
      use. APRV is a pressure-cycled ventilator mode that allows a patient a greater degree of
      autonomy in controlling his or her breathing pattern than ARDSNet ventilation. Use of APRV
      has been associated with better oxygenation, less sedative usage, and less
      ventilator-associated pneumonia in small studies compared with other ventilator modes.
      However, debate exists over whether APRV might result in decreased or increased
      ventilator-associated lung injury when compared with ARDSNet ventilation. We intend to
      implement a randomized, cross over study looking at biomarkers of lung injury in patients
      with acute lung injury during ventilation with APRV and using the ARDSNet protocol. Our
      hypothesis is that airway pressure release ventilation is associated with lower levels of
      lung injury biomarkers than ARDSNet ventilation.

      To estimate the incidence of H1N1v influenza-like illness and to study the risk factors for
      serious influenza forms during pandemic period in French HIV infected patients.

        -  Definitions:

             -  Influenza like illness is defined as fever> 37°8C and cough or pharyngalgia.
                (Centers for Disease Control definition).

             -  Serious forms of influenza-like illness is defined by hospitalization within 14
                days onset of symptoms or death attributed to influenza like illness.

        -  Design:

             -  Survey sampling for estimating H1N1v influenza-like illness incidence.

             -  Out of approximately 50 000 patients under follow-up in one of the 40 ANRS centres,
                a sub-group will be selected by random sampling. Sampling will be stratified by
                centre and sampling fraction per site will vary in order to select 60 to 80
                patients for this study per site. A total of 2500 to 3000 patients will be selected
                to allow for estimating the incidence of H1N1v influenza-like illness with an
                adequate precision.

      Selected patients will be asked to contact the clinical staff on site as soon as any
      influenza like symptoms appear. In the case of influenza like illness patients are requested
      to attend to the clinic within 24 hours for physical examination and naso-pharyngeal swab for
      diagnosis of A(H1N1)v infection.

      The purpose of this research study is to study the safety of increasing doses of FBS0701, and
      to see how quickly the study medication is absorbed and how quickly it disappears from the
      bloodstream. FBS0701 is a new, oral iron chelator - a medication taken by mouth that
      increases the body's elimination of iron. Iron chelators are used in patients who develop
      iron overload from their transfusions. Four increasing doses of FBS0701 will be tested during
      this study. The study will start with the lowest dose given to 4 patients (3 mg/kg/day. The
      next group of 4 patients will receive the next high dose (8mg/kg/day only after the results
      of the first 4 patients are examined and it is determined safe to continue. Participating
      patients will take the study medication for 7 days and be followed for 28 days after their
      last dose to determine if they have any reactions to the study medication - therefore a total
      of 35 days on study. Patients will need to give up to 17 blood samples over the screening
      period and first 15 days of the study (a total of about 9 tablespoons). Patients will not
      need to stay overnight in the clinic but will need to visit the clinic 10 times for screening
      and on-study visits over the 35 days. Patients currently taking an iron chelator will need to
      stop that treatment for up to 22 days (up to 5 days before they start the study and for 15
      days during the study). The results of this study will be helpful in determining the safety
      of the drug and the best doses of FBS0701 to be used in the next study which will assess the
      effectiveness of this new iron chelator.

      Atrial fibrillation (AF) affects as many as 1 in 100 people and reduces the quality of life
      of large numbers of people in the UK and around the world. Catheter ablation is a minimally
      invasive treatment that has been developed to help eliminate AF. It is a complex procedure to
      perform so only a few hospitals are able to offer this treatment in the UK. A new technology
      allows the operator to guide their catheters (thin wires) in the patient by using a
      robotically steered sheath. This allows accurate and precise navigation that may improve the
      accuracy and integrity of ablation. We aim to prove whether this technology can make AF
      ablation easier and more effective.

NCT01030900,Phase II Trial of Alemtuzumab (Campath) and Dose-Adjusted EPOCH-Rituximab (DA-EPOCH-R) in Relapsed or Refractory Diffuse Large B-Cell and Hodgkin Lymphomas,"
      Background:

        -  Studies conducted at the National Cancer Institute suggest that certain chemotherapy
           drugs may be more effective if given by continuous infusion into the vein rather than by
           the standard method of rapid intravenous injection. One combination of six chemotherapy
           drugs, known as EPOCH-R, has had a high degree of effectiveness in people with certain
           kinds of cancer.

        -  Recent evidence also indicates that the effects of chemotherapy may be improved by
           combining the treatment with monoclonal antibodies, which are purified proteins that are
           specially made to attach to foreign substances such as cancer cells. A monoclonal
           antibody called campath (alemtuzumab) has been manufactured to attach to a protein
           called CD52 that may target tumor cells or the surrounding inflammatory cells.

        -  Researchers are interested in developing new treatments for large B-cell lymphoma or
           Hodgkin lymphoma that can best be treated with chemotherapy. This protocol is
           specifically for people with diffuse large B-cell or Hodgkin lymphomas that have not
           responded to standard treatments.

      Objectives:

      - To test whether giving campath (alemtuzumab) in combination with continuous infusion
      EPOCH-R chemotherapy will improve the outcome of lymphoma treatment.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals 18 years of age and older who have large B-cell lymphoma or Hodgkin lymphoma
      that has not responded well to standard treatments.

      Design:

        -  During the study, patients will receive standard EPOCH-R chemotherapy, which includes
           the following drugs: etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin,
           and rituximab. The additional drug, campath, will be given by IV infusion on the first
           day of treatment over several hours.

        -  When the campath IV infusion and rituximab IV infusion are complete, the drugs
           doxorubicin, etoposide, and vincristine will each be given by continuous IV infusion
           over the next 4 days (that is, continuously for a total of 96 hours). Cyclophosphamide
           will be given by IV infusion over several hours on Day 5. Prednisone will be given by
           mouth twice each day for 5 days.

        -  Patients may be given other drugs to treat the side effects of chemotherapy, to prevent
           possible infections, and to improve white blood cell counts.

        -  The campath-EPOCH-R therapy will be repeated every 21 days, as a cycle of therapy, for a
           total of 6 cycles. Following the fourth and sixth treatment cycles (approximately weeks
           12 and 18) of campath-EPOCH-R treatment, study researchers will perform blood tests and
           CT/MRI scans on all patients to assess their response to the treatment.

NCT01034228,Isoleucine Added ORS in Children With Diarrhoea,"
      Efforts are continuing to improve the efficacy of oral rehydration solution in terms of
      reducing the severity (stool volume) and duration of diarrhoea (enhancement of recovery).
      Antimicrobial peptides, produced by the epithelial cells, represent an important component of
      the innate immunity of all epithelial surfaces of the body including intestine. Induction of
      expression of antimicrobial peptides on epithelial cell surface, may thus hasten recovery
      from infectious diarrhoea. Isoleucine is an essential amino acid that is easily available and
      not very expensive, and its addition to oral rehydration solution might help early clearance
      of diarrhoeal pathogen by inducing secretion of antimicrobial peptide by the small intestinal
      epithelial cells. Additionally, it is expected to hasten recovery from diarrhoea by

NCT01037569,Optimizing Toxicological Screening in Drug Endangered Children,"
      Background:

        -  Children who enter the foster care system are all too often exposed to illicit drugs in
           the home. Children from these homes, known as drug endangered children, are not
           routinely tested for harmful substances. Any short- and long-term physical or
           developmental problems they may experience as a result of this exposure often go
           undetected and untreated.

        -  Children who are placed into protective custody are not always screened by physicians or
           nurse practitioners. Although drug-endangered children under 18 years of age
           automatically receive a urine toxicology screen to determine the types and levels of
           illicit drugs in their systems, this procedure has difficulties and limitations that may
           affect the quality of the data. Researchers are interested in developing more effective
           methods of analyzing the presence or absence of illicit environmental drug exposure in
           children.

      Objectives:

      - To determine the most effective method of identifying long-term illicit stimulant drug
      exposure in drug-endangered children.

      Eligibility:

      - Children under 18 years of age who are being placed into protective custody after having
      been found in a home where drugs are manufactured, used, or sold.

      Design:

        -  Researchers will gain verbal consent for the procedure for children who are 7 years of
           age or older. Children younger than 7 years of age will not be required to give verbal
           consent for sample collection.

        -  Researchers will collect standard urine samples for toxicological screening. Part of the
           sample will be sent to the National Institute on Drug Abuse for evaluation; the rest
           will remain with the local authority.

        -  In addition to this standard procedure, researchers will collect a hair sample by
           cutting a small amount of hair from the crown of the head as close to the root as
           possible (and not pulling any hair out of the child's head).

        -  Researchers will also use an oral swab to collect a saliva sample from the inside cheek
           of each child.

NCT01036230,The Effects of Expectation on Natural and Drug -Induced Rewards,"
      Background:

        -  Environmental cues frequently induce expectancies in individuals that may strongly
           influence the actual experience associated with the cue. This has both positive and
           negative consequences for behavior and decision making. For instance, when an addicted
           individual experiences cues associated with imminent drug taking, an expectancy of the
           coming experience is also formed and very likely has an effect on the subsequent
           experience of the drug.

        -  Researchers are interested in studying how the brain responds to these kinds of
           environmental cues and expectancies in order to learn more about addiction and craving
           in substance-abusing individuals.

      Objectives:

        -  To compare the response to rewards (both drug-related and non-drug-related) in cocaine
           users and non-using individuals.

        -  To study the effect of expectation on reward-related (both drug-induced and
           non-drug-induced) responses and brain activity in cocaine users and non-using

      -Individuals between 18 and 45 years of age who are regular cocaine users but otherwise
      healthy, or healthy individuals who are not cocaine users.

      Design:

        -  This study involves two experiments. Participants will be assigned to one or both
           experiments.

        -  Participants must not use any drugs for at least 3 days before the visit, may not
           consume alcohol for 24 hours before the visit, and may not consume caffeinated beverages
           for 12 hours before the visit. On the day of the visit, participants will provide both
           urine and breath samples to test for drug/alcohol use.

        -  Experiment 1: In the MRI scanner, participants will respond to questions and images on a
           screen, and will receive small amounts of flavored liquid (chocolate or cherry) through
           a tube in the mouth.

NCT01037075,Influence of Nicotine on Cognitive Function in Schizophrenic Patients With and Without Comorbid Drug Dependence,"
      Background:

        -  Individuals with schizophrenia have a significantly higher tendency to develop substance
           abuse or dependence than the general population. For instance, people with schizophrenia
           smoke much more than the general population, and many are dependent on street drugs such
           as cocaine and heroin. However, these individuals are rarely included in research
           studies that might provide more information about treatments for both schizophrenia and
           substance abuse.

        -  Strong evidence suggests that schizophrenia and substance dependence have similar
           effects on the brain, affecting attention, memory, and eye movement. Other research
           indicates that schizophrenia and substance dependence affect the same parts of the
           dopamine system, contributing to problems in brain function that require treatment.
           These new developments provide a strong rationale to study the combination of
           schizophrenia and substance dependence.

        -  Nicotine may help improve brain function and thinking in individuals with both
           schizophrenia and drug dependence. Some of the thinking and memory problems experienced
           by these individuals can be treated with nicotine. However, more research is needed to
           determine exactly how nicotine affects individuals with both schizophrenia and drug
           dependence.

      Objectives:

        -  To determine whether individuals with schizophrenia and drug dependence show impairment
           in tests of eye tracking, attention, and memory compared with healthy control subjects.

        -  To evaluate the effect of nicotine on eye tracking, attention, and memory in individuals
           with both schizophrenia and substance dependence.

      Eligibility:

      - Current smokers (at least 10 cigarettes per day for the past year) between 18 and 55 years
      of age who (1) have been diagnosed with schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder, (2) have been
      diagnosed with schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder and are currently using heroin and/or
      cocaine, or (3) are healthy individuals with no family history of psychotic illness.

      Design:

        -  The study will consist of one training session and three testing sessions. Each session
           will last about 2 hours.

        -  The training session will introduce participants to the study tests and evaluate their
           tolerance of the nicotine nasal spray used in the study. Participants who cannot
           tolerate the higher dose of the spray will not continue in the study.

        -  At the start of each testing session, smokers will have one cigarette to standardize the
           time of the most recent exposure to nicotine.

        -  During the testing sessions, participants will receive a placebo spray, a lower dose of
           nicotine, or a higher dose of nicotine, and then will be asked to perform tests that
           evaluate attention, memory, and other thinking tasks.

      Macular Edema (Swelling of a particular site of the retina) can become a significant problem
      for Diabetics undergoing Cataract surgery. And a significant number of people who undergo
      Cataract surgery each year are diabetics. And when you multiply these two factors together
      you are left with a significant number of people who do not gain as much vision as their
      peers. Diabetics who develop Macular Edema actually can loose some vision after surgery and
      when you follow them up, they don't gain as much vision. This Study aims to prevent such an
      event from happening and therefore allow Diabetics to gain as much vision as they can from
      cataract surgery. This study will use Dexamethasone injected intravitreally (into the gel of
      the eye) at the end of cataract extraction to control Macular edema brought about by surgery.
      The main outcome is the central retina thickness and retinal volume as measured by Optical

      Other Drugs, life Bevacizumab and Pegaptanib, have been used for this purpose but they are
      expensive and have potential systemic side-effects due to anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial
      growth factor) actions. Dexamethasone has been used in the eye for decades and is
      short-lived, minimizing possible systemic effects. Moreover, this drug is at least 15x
      cheaper than the previously mentioned ones and therefore has tremendous benefit for
      developing countries. We seek an alternative drug that can reduce or prevent Macular edema at

      1. Background: Heparin forms a complex with a plasma protein, antithrombin III (ATIII) is
           an endogenous anticoagulant. This complex inhibits the formation of thrombin and
           accelerates its destruction. In addition, heparin and ATIII inactivate other proteases
           of the coagulation cascade, especially the anti-activated factor X. The outcome of these
           biochemical actions is the inhibition of the formation and synthesis of activators of
           the clotting factors that exert critical functions in the genesis of the blood clot.

NCT01032551,Vascular Access Decision Aid,"
      Coronary angiogram (CA) procedures, with and without angioplasty, can be performed via
      vascular access in the wrist (radial artery) or leg (femoral artery). Both radial and femoral
      artery vascular access have their advantages and disadvantages, but neither has yet been
      proven to have superior health outcomes. Often patients are eligible for both access sites
      but are not well informed regarding the potential advantages and disadvantages of each site.
      Vascular access in cardiac catheterization can be considered a ""grey zone"", where the
      benefits and harms may have different levels of significance depending on the individual's
      preferences and values. For example, patients with significant back pain may not prefer the
      femoral approach as it requires the patient to lie flay for an extended period of time
      compared to the radial approach.

      For ""grey zone"" health care options, Patient Decision Aids (PtDA) have been demonstrated to
      improve the quality of decision making by significantly improving knowledge of the patient's
      health care options, improving the patient's accurate risk perception, and improving value
      congruence with the chosen options.

      The investigators propose a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the decision
      quality impact of a vascular access PtDA compared to ""usual care"" in eligible patient's
      undergoing elective CA procedures. If the PtDA is demonstrated to positively impact the
      decision quality of patients prior to CA procedures, it would be an invaluable bedside tool
      to promote patient informed medical decision making.

      Hypothesis:

      The investigators believe that a PtDA, when compared to usual care, will positively impact
      the decision quality and the process of decision making, relating to vascular access options
      in eligible patients undergoing elective CA procedures.

      The main objective of the present study is to assess the impact of double fortified salt
      containing iron and iodine on work performance (productivity) of women plantation workers in
      India. Efficacy studies have shown that salt double-fortified with iodine and iron can
      significantly reduce the incidence rates of iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) and
      iodine-deficiency disorders. Double-fortified salt (DFS) can be prepared by mixing
      microencapsulated iron compounds into conventionally iodated salt (Yuan et al, 2008). Iron
      deficiency anemia affects the work productivity and physical activity. Many studies have
      shown that when the individuals with low Hb received iron supplement, their work performance
      improved markedly. Animal studies have demonstrated that iron deficient anemic rats had a
      lower work tolerance as measured by oxygen consumption than the adult rats with normal Hb
      levels (Ohira et al, 1981). Several human studies have demonstrated the effect of iron
      supplementation on endurance capacity and work productivity in women (Zhu and Haas, 1997,
      1998; Edgerton et al., 1979). Many human studies have also examined the possible linkages
      between iron deficiency and concurrent cognitive or behavioral outcomes. Iron supplementation
      effective in reducing iron-deficiency anemia would also result in better behavioral and
      developmental outcome. Many studies found that IDA had a great influence on cognitive
      functions in infants and school children (Lozoff et al., 2003, 1998 and Friel et al., 2003).
      However, studies of IDA and cognitive function in adults are few and controversial.

      This study will assess iron status and physical and mental performance at 2 time points,
      before and after approximately 10 months during which a controlled intervention will take
      place on tea estates at the Panighatta Tea Garden near Siliguri, West Bengal. Subjects will
      be women between 18 and 50 years of age who are actively employed as full time tea pickers.
      The study requires that 2 experimental groups of subjects be identified: a) an experimental
      group that consumes double fortified salt (DFS) containing iron + iodine, and b) a control
      group that consumes only iodized salt (IS).

      Up to three cohorts (Cohorts 1-3), each consisting of approximately 20 patients with
      mild-moderately active ulcerative colitis not limited to the rectum, will be included, one
      for each dose level of GSK1399686 to be tested. Within a cohort, patients will be randomized
      in a 3:1:1 ratio to receive GSK1399686 (once daily over 4 weeks, followed by 2 weeks dosing
      with placebo), placebo, or ASACOL (t.i.d. for 6 weeks), respectively.

      An interim analysis of fecal markers and disease activity data will be performed by the end
      of Cohort 3. Based upon results, the study may be stopped or continued by recruiting either
      Cohort 4 (if data on an additional dose level would be warranted to establish or clarify a
      dose-response relationship) or, in the case of a robust efficacy signal at any dose level

NCT01036802,Anticoagulation For Pulmonary Hypertension in Sickle Cell Disease,"
      Sickle cell disease (SCD) is often referred to as a hypercoagulable state. However, the
      contribution of coagulation activation to the pathogenesis of SCD remains uncertain.
      Pulmonary hypertension (PHT) is a common complication associated with significant morbidity
      and mortality. Autopsy studies of SCD patients with PHT show evidence of in situ thrombosis
      involving pulmonary vessels, similar to findings in non-sickle cell patients with PHT.
      Anticoagulation has been reported to be of benefit in non-sickle cell patients with PHT. With
      the evidence of increased coagulation activation in SCD, PHT represents a clinical endpoint
      that may be used to evaluate the contribution of coagulation activation to the
      pathophysiology of SCD. The investigators hypothesize that increased thrombin generation, as
      well as platelet activation are central to the pathophysiology of SCD and contribute to the
      occurrence of several SCD-related complications, including PHT. As a consequence, treatment
      modalities that down-regulate thrombin generation would be expected to delay the progression
      of PHT and result in improved survival in patients with SCD.

      from Psoriasis Clinic of Department of Dermatology, Venerology and Leprology, PGIMER.
      Patients will be randomly assigned to one of the three groups: Group A, consisting of 20
      patients, will be administered acitretin 25 mg/ day ,Group B, consisting of 20 patients, will
      be administered acitretin 35 mg/day and GROUP C consisting of 20 patients, will be

      This novel compound is a new experimental treatment that may help people to stop compulsive
      overeating. Compulsive overeating or binge eating is one of the main reasons why people are
      overweight or obese. Recent research has shown that some kinds of overeating may be linked to
      a brain chemical called dopamine. There is some evidence that blocking the action of this
      chemical in animals can reduce food intake, particularly of foods that are high in fat and
      sugar. The purpose of this study is to find out if this compound (which blocks the effects of
      dopamine) has the same effect in overweight or obese people, as it does in animals.

NCT01039922,SwissNET - a Registry for Neuroendocrine Tumours in Switzerland,"
      Gastroentero-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (GEP-NETs) are regarded as a fairly rare
      disease. They are derived from the neuroendocrine system of the gastrointestinal tract and
      the pancreas and share common clinical features. So far, there is still uncertainty about the
      cell biology and mechanistic regulation of these tumours. Therefore targeted treatment is
      limited and management challenging. Treatment options include surgery, medical and ablative
      therapy, and more recently peptide-receptor radionuclide therapy. In order to better
      understand the characteristics of GEP-NETs and to evaluate treatment strategies, the SwissNET
      registry aims at the collection of data from patients presenting with a GEP-NET in
      Switzerland. Data will be entered prospectively and anonymized in a specifically designed
      database after the patient has given informed consent. All hospitals and general
      practitioners are invited to report on patients with a GEP-NET diagnosis and to participate
      to the registry. Data will be evaluated within regular time frames, focussing on types of
      GEP-NETs, treatment modalities and patient outcomes (e.g. mortality, hospitalisation rate),

NCT01033188,Double Bundle Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction,"
      There has been an increased awareness towards ACL (anterior cruciate ligament) injuries for
      Norwegian teams, particularly in handball and soccer. The reported number of reconstructions
      in Norway ranges from 1500 to 2000 per year, and in the United States from 50,000 to 100,000
      per year, making ACL reconstruction one of the most common orthopaedic procedures performed,
      especially among young, active and healthy individuals. However, reports state that there is
      a subset of patients (10-40%) who remain subjectively and objectively unstable and/or are
      unable to regain prior function. Additionally, it has been reported that degenerative joint
      disease is associated with traditional single-bundle ACL reconstructions in up to 50% of the
      patients in long term follow up studies.

      It is well known that the ACL is composed of 2 functional bundles named after their tibial
      attachments, the anteromedial (AM) and posterolateral (PL) bundles.

      It is believed that the current single-graft, single-bundle technique for reconstructing the
      anterior cruciate ligament does not anatomically reconstruct either one of these bundles.

      In the last two years, the double bundle technique has been introduced and a few clinical
      studies are available, however only a few RCTs.

      Further study is very important to determine if double-bundle ACL reconstructions should be
      performed, if single-bundle reconstructions can be adjusted to better adapt to their
      biomechanical insufficiency in restoring internal rotation torques and valgus moments, and
      also in trying to identify which patients might better benefit from single-bundle versus
      double-bundle ACL reconstructions.

NCT01033994,A Multicenter Study of rhFGF 18 in Patients With Knee Osteoarthritis Not Requiring Surgery,"
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most common diseases affecting the joints, usually those
      that are weight bearing such as the knees. OA is considered to be a disease of the cartilage
      in the joints even though it involves the whole joint, including the bone and synovium (thin
      lining of the joints which produces synovial fluid). With time, more and more of the
      cartilage is destroyed by the disease with inflammation commonly occurring.

      AS902330 is expected to increase the production and development of specific bone cells:
      chondrocytes and osteoblasts (cells that produce and maintain bone and cartilage). This is
      expected to lead to repair and generation of the cartilage, and a narrowing of the space
      width between the knee joints in a selected region of the knee cartilage. The purpose of this

      children 8-11 years old who sleep 9-10 hours per night will be enrolled for a 3-week study.
      For 1 week each, children will be asked to sleep their typical amount, increase their sleep
      by 1-½ hours, and decrease their sleep by 1-½ hours. Half of the children will be asked to
      increase their sleep first and half to decrease their sleep first. During each week, the
      following will be gathered: sleep duration (measured by actigraphy, which is a small device
      that measures sleep), levels of hormones measured through blood draws, self-reported hunger
      and appetite, food intake (measured by 3 days of 24-hour recall), how motivated children are
      to eat (measured using a computer activity), and child height and weight. We believe that
      when children sleep less they will show changes in hormones associated with hunger and

      reduce depressive symptoms, improve family functioning, and improve medication compliance.
      The intervention is delivered in two phases (1 - reduction of depressive symptoms and family
      conflict, 2 - adherence promotion) as efforts to improve adherence will have a greater

      The study will determine whether the anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody, teplizumab, can help to
      prevent or delay the onset of type 1 diabetes (T1D) in relatives determined to be at very
      high risk for developing the disease. Teplizumab has been studied in new onset type 1
      diabetes for testing of efficacy and safety in previous studies; other studies are currently
      in progress. The results of previous studies indicate that teplizumab reduces the loss of
      insulin production during the first year after diagnosis in individuals with type 1 diabetes.
      The purpose of this study is to determine if teplizumab can interdict the immune process that
      causes the destruction of insulin secreting beta cells in the pancreas during the

NCT01038089,Pilot Study Of The Effects Of Resveratrol On Endothelial Function In Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,"
      Observational studies have shown that consumption of grapes and grape products such as red
      wine is associated with reduced cardiovascular risk. The mechanisms accounting for this
      benefit remain incompletely understood. Resveratrol is a component of grapes and red wine
      that has favorable effects on endothelial function in diabetic and obese animals. Resveratrol
      is available to people over-the-counter in health food stores and the internet as a dietary
      supplement.

      The endothelium plays a central role in the control of blood vessel function. When healthy,
      the endothelium prevents vasospasm, blood clot formation, and the development of
      atherosclerosis. Endothelial function is abnormal in patients with diabetes mellitus and this
      abnormality contributes to the development of cardiovascular disease.

      The present pilot study is designed to test the hypothesis that resveratrol (90 mg/day and
      270 mg/day for one week each) will have favorable effects on endothelial function in patients
      with diabetes mellitus.

NCT01036958,Development and Validation of a Symptom Scale for Children With Chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease,"
      Background:

        -  Chronic graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in
           patients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. The symptoms of chronic GVHD
           are similar to those of other autoimmune diseases, and treatment for the pain often
           involves steroid use that can cause severe side effects over the long term.

        -  At present, there is no research instrument that measures symptoms in children with
           chronic GVHD. Treatment practitioners may use one of several pediatric quality of life
           questionnaires, but because none of these is specific for chronic GVHD each instrument
           has potential gaps in its ability to assess the full spectrum of problems experienced by
           children with chronic GVHD. Researchers are interested in developing a better
           understanding of the disease burden experienced by children and adolescents with chronic
           GVHD.

      Objectives:

      - To develop a Pediatric Chronic GVHD Symptom Scale (PCSS) that reliably measures the
      disease-specific burden of chronic GVHD in children.

      Eligibility:

      - Children and adolescents 5 to 18 years of age who have undergone prior allogeneic stem cell
      transplant and have been diagnosed with chronic GVHD that requires treatment.

      Design:

        -  There are two phases to the study; participants will enroll in phase I (question
           generation) at this time.

        -  Researchers will interview participants and ask open-ended questions (requiring more
           than a one- or two-word response) about symptoms that adults with chronic GVHD have
           found problematic.

        -  Both parents and children will participate in the interviews, which will be
           audio-recorded. Depending on the child or adolescent s age, the interviews may be
           conducted together with the parents or separately.

NCT01031160,Health Behavior in School-Age Children: NEXT Longitudinal Study 2009-2016,"
      NEXT is a seven-year longitudinal assessment of a representative sample of U.S. adolescent
      and young adults starting at grade 10. The goals of the NEXT longitudinal study include: to
      identify the trajectory of adolescent health status and health behaviors from mid-adolescence
      through the post high school years; to examine individual predictors of the onset of key
      adolescent risk behaviors and risk indicators during this period; to identify genetic,
      personal, family, school, and social/environmental factors that promote or sustain positive
      health behaviors; to identify transition points in health risk and risk behaviors and changes
      in family, school, and social/environmental precursors to these transitions, and to examine
      the role of potential gene-environment interactions in the development of health status and
      health behaviors. .

      This study collects reliable and valid data on health behaviors and health indicators and
      their social, environmental, and biological contexts beginning with a nationally
      representative probability cohort of 10th-grade children in the U.S in 2009 and following
      them through 2016. Measures are collected annually for seven years beginning in the 2009-2010
      school year and ending in the 2016-2017 school year. African-American youth are oversampled
      to provide better population estimates of this group and to provide an adequate sample to
      examine racial/ethnic differences in longitudinal predictors of health, health behaviors, and
      health behavior change. Hispanic youth do not require oversampling because they currently
      represent a sufficient proportion of the population of adolescents to provide an adequate
      sample to examine racial/ethnic differences. Self-reports of health status, health behaviors,
      and health attitudes are collected by in-school and online surveys. Anthropometric data,
      genetic information, and neighborhood characteristics are gathered on all participants as
      well. The study also incorporates an Administrator Survey and other data sources to obtain
      related information on school-level health programs and community-level contextual data. The
      NEXT Generation Health Study data support NICHD, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute
      (NHLBI), National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and
      Alcoholism (NIAAA) and the Maternal and Child Health Branch of the Health Resources and
      Services Administration (HRSA/MCHB) in fulfillment of program requirements that address
      supportive health environments for adolescents and young adults. In addition, a
      representative subsample of overweight and normal weight adolescents has been identified:
      additional data on behavioral risk factors and biological markers and risk factors are
      gathered on these adolescents. Driving performance will also be evaluated in 150 young

NCT01031940,CMAC® Versus Airtraq® and Macintosh Laryngoscope in Difficult Tracheal Intubation.,"
      It is essential that anaesthetists successfully perform orotracheal intubation in scenarios
      in which intubation is potentially more difficult, such as where anatomical characteristics
      predictive of difficult intubation are present.

      The CMAC® Laryngoscope is a new intubating device. It is designed to provide a view of the
      glottis without alignment of the oral, pharyngeal and tracheal axes.

      The CMAC may be especially effective in situations where intubation of the trachea is
      potentially difficult.

      The efficacy of this device in comparison to the traditional Macintosh laryngoscope and other
      novel laryngoscopes is not known.

      We aim to compare its performance to that of the Macintosh laryngoscope, the gold standard
      device, in patients with one or more anatomical characteristics predictive of difficult
      intubation.

      The investigators further aim to compare it to the Airtraq® device a device which has been
      shown to be superior to the Macintosh laryngoscope in previous trials.

      The investigators primary hypothesis is that, in the hands of experienced anaesthetists, time
      to intubation would be shorter using the CMAC than using the Macintosh laryngoscope in
      patients with two or more anatomical characteristics predictive of difficult intubation.

      The investigators further hypothesize that the Airtraq® will be superior the CMAC® with one
      or more anatomical characteristics predictive of difficult intubation.

NCT01036516,PET Assays of Striatal Dopamine Marker in Cocaine Craving,"
      Background:

        -  Cues related to past drug use induce a particular pattern of brain activation, which has
           been correlated with craving for cocaine in active cocaine abusers. Researchers are
           interested in determining the role of the brain chemical dopamine in cue-elicited as
           well as spontaneous craving for cocaine.

        -  To study the role of dopamine in cocaine craving, researchers will use positron emission
           tomography (PET) to compare the neural reactions of cocaine users with those of
           non-substance-abusing healthy volunteers. Researchers hope that the data gathered from
           this study will lead to the development of more effective anti-craving medications.

      Objectives:

        -  To clarify the role of dopamine in cue-elicited responses that contribute to cocaine
           abuse.

        -  To determine if PET results of this study differ with various means of administering PET
           chemicals.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals 21 to 44 years of age who are either current cocaine users (at least twice per
      week) or healthy volunteers without a history of drug abuse.

      Design:

        -  Cocaine-using participants will enter the inpatient clinical research ward at the
           National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Addiction Research Center for 2 nights before
           the day of the study. In addition, these participants will stay overnight at NIDA the
           evening after each PET session and will be discharged the following day. Cocaine-using
           participants will be required to perform a balance test before the study to provide a
           baseline response in case they require anti-anxiety medications to cope with the effects
           of the study.

        -  Control subjects will not be required to stay overnight and will arrive as outpatients
           for the PET session. All participants will be required to abstain from alcohol and
           caffeine consumption from midnight before each study session, and will not be permitted
           to smoke on the day of testing.

        -  - On the day of the study, participants will undergo a practice session to set up the
           PET scanning equipment. Following the practice session, participants will be shown video
           recordings of images that are related to nature (e.g., seashells) or to drug abuse
           (e.g., drug paraphernalia). Participant reactions will be studied through the PET
           monitoring, and the study will be conducted in two separate PET sessions with a break in
           between. Individuals in the cocaine-using group may receive anti-anxiety medication if
           the stimulus cues increase anxiety related to cocaine craving.

NCT01035008,Confocal Endomicroscopy of Pancreatic InVivo,"
      Confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) is a novel and highly promising imaging method for that
      allows in vivo imaging of the mucosal layer at resolution of approximately 1 micron. Cellular
      and sub-cellular structures as well as capillaries and single red blood cells can be
      visualized. CLE is now well established as a highly accurate method for distinguishing
      neoplasia in the gastrointestinal tract lumen via endoscopy. A major new breakthrough is the
      development of sub-millimeter CLE probes that can be passed via an image guided needle (nCLE)
      into solid organs and cysts.

      It is hypothesized that nCLE will help distinguish the benign, premalignant and malignant
      cystic lesions of pancreas by visualizing the cellular lining of the cysts, thereby, avoiding
      unnecessary surgery in patient with benign cysts and guiding to early and effective surgical
      removal of high risk neoplastic lesions.

      A prototype minimal risk nCLE system has been developed that can be passed via standard
      endoscopic ultrasound needles into the pancreas but FDA clearance for in vivo use is not
      expected until late 2010. The investigators propose to evaluate this prototype nCLE system in

      to have a recurrence of substance abuse within 1 year of discharge from treatment (7).

      There is therefore a clear clinical challenge in treating patients with the dual disorder
      which may calls for further research and the possible introduction of new and innovative
      strategies including the use of mobile phone technology to provide increased support for
      patients with the dual diagnosis.

      There are established research evidence for using Short Message Service (SMS) text messages
      to remind patients of scheduled medical appointments (8,9,10,12, 13), coordinate medical
      staff,(14) deliver medical test results,(15,16) , promote smoking cessation ( 17), improve
      self-monitoring among the youth with type 1 diabetes( 18), promote weight loss among obese
      subjects (19 ) and monitor patient side effects following treatment(20).

      Relevance of the research:

      To date, after an extensive review of the literature using MEDLINE, Pub Med, ERIC, Web of
      Science, Science Direct and PsycINFO, no studies was found on the use of SMS text messages as
      an intervention to address abstinence amongst alcohol dependent subjects who are co-morbid
      for a depressive disorder. Thus, the investigators seek to determine if text messaging is a
      useful and effective strategy to help maintain abstinence, improve adherence with medication
      and ultimately promote mental stability in depressed patients discharged from an in-patient
      dual diagnosis programme. The investigators hypothesize that, daily supportive/reminder SMS
      text messages to depressed patients discharged from an in-patient dual diagnosis programme
      would increase alcohol abstinence rates , improve medication adherence rates and improve the
      overall mental well being of patients compared with those receiving treatment as usual.

      Dried plums (Prunus domestica L.) have traditionally been recognized for their health
      benefits related to conditions such as constipation, irregular menstrual cycles and mouth
      sores. This dried fruit provides high levels of fiber, vitamins and minerals. Dried plum has
      also been shown in animal studies to have beneficial effects on bone and can prevent the loss
      of bone caused by low hormone levels such as occurs after surgical removal of the ovaries. We
      also have shown that dried plum can prevent the loss of bone associated with aging in mice.
      Very few therapies for osteoporosis actually reverse bone loss and improve bone strength. The

      This program offers the opportunity to receive an allogeneic transplant to try to control the
      malignant hematologic in the absence of acceptable conventional donor and with a risk-benefit
      ratio equivalent to that which would be expected with a transplant from a more conventional
      donor.

      An economy of means in that this method could serve as an alternative to 2 units of placental
      blood transplantation. The current cost of disposal of a unit of placental blood from a bank
      is approximately 22000 € (Source: Biomedicine Agency, 2007 rates). The amplification process
      as controlled by ""EFSAL"" is 12000 €. Therefore, buying a unit and ex-vivo amplification is
      more economical. Moreover, the availability of placental blood is not infinite, and the use
      of one unit per patient will also save resources that can be valuable for certain groups of
      patients.

      In the longer term, methods of amplification of specific immunocompetent cells (from the
      fraction of CD 34 neg cells) are already being evaluated in the laboratory. They allow to

NCT01038336,Hearing Loss Prevention for Veterans,"
      Hearing loss is the most prevalent service-connected disability in the VA. It causes
      communication difficulties, which contribute to isolation, frustration and depression. A
      major cause of hearing loss is from exposure to high levels of sound, and is referred to as
      Noise Induced Hearing Loss (NIHL). Veterans have inevitably been exposed to high levels of
      sound during military service, and even though they may not yet have NIHL, their ears have
      been damaged. Continued noise exposure in civilian life will result in NIHL. However, it can
      easily be prevented by avoiding noise or using hearing protection. Most people are unaware
      that noise damages hearing, and even when they are, they do not use hearing protection. In
      this study we will use a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the short- and long-term
      effectiveness of two forms of education about NIHL that we have developed for Veterans. One

      - New research on genetics and the human genome has helped to identify certain genes that
      affect specific parts of the brain, including the parts that may be involved in drug use and
      dependency. Researchers are interested in studying both genetic information and brain
      activity to better understand variations in brain function among individuals.

      Objectives:

      - To study brain activity in conjunction with specific genetic information provided by
      healthy volunteers including smokers, non-smokers, people with drug dependence, and those who
      do not have any dependence on any substance.

      Eligibility:

      - Healthy volunteers between 18 and 50 years of age.

      Design:

        -  This is an 8 10 hour study which may be completed in 1, 2, or 3 visits.

      Background:

      - People who are in treatment for substance abuse often feel distress during the withdrawal
      period and afterward. Some individuals feel distress more acutely than others, and this
      distress has been linked to poor treatment outcomes and increased risk of relapse in smokers,
      alcoholics, and cocaine- and heroin-dependent individuals. More research is needed on the
      effects of distress on the brain, particularly in individuals who are seeking treatment for
      substance abuse. Researchers are interested in using functional magnetic resonance imaging
      (fMRI) scanning to study distress tolerance in both substance users seeking treatment and
      healthy non-drug-using volunteers.

      Objectives:

      - To use functional magnetic resonance imaging to study the effectiveness of a distress
      tolerance assessment.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals between 18 and 50 years of age who are either cocaine dependent or healthy
      non-drug-using volunteers.

      Design:

        -  This study involves an initial screening visit and a scanning visit, with four followup
           visits.

        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical examination, as well
           as blood samples and questionnaires about mood and past and current drug use.

        -  Participants will have a structural MRI scan of the brain to provide a baseline reading
           for comparison. Participants will then have an fMRI scanning session, which will include
           both the distress tolerance assessment and relevant control tasks. Heart rate, blood
           pressure, and other physical reactions will be monitored throughout the scan.
           Participants will also provide blood and saliva samples to measure stress hormone
           levels.

NCT01038596,Mesenchymal Stromal Cells and Osteoarthritis,"
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most frequent musculoskeletal disorders and represents the
      main indication for total joint arthroplasty. Multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs)
      can be easily isolated and culture expanded from bone marrow aspirates and provide an
      excellent source of progenitor cells for cell-based regeneration strategies due to their ex

NCT01031745,"Contingency Management in the Delivery of HAART to Drug Users in Chennai, India","
      Drug use (DU) is a major risk factor for HIV infection in many regions of the world. However,
      as highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has been rolled out in South and South East
      Asia, less than 2% of individuals initiated on HAART were drug users (DUs) or former DUs,
      despite the fact that approximately 20% of HIV infections in the region are ascribed to DU.
      India is home to about 2.4 million HIV-infected individuals. Though, injection drug users
      contribute to only about 3% of all HIV infections in India; it is estimated that there are
      between 168,000 and 1.1 million DUs in India with HIV prevalence about 30%. Novel approaches
      are needed to engage disenfranchised populations in HIV care in lower and middle income
      countries, where the burden of HIV disease is growing. Incentive-based strategies (or
      contingency management) have been shown to be effective in reducing illicit drug use, smoking
      cessation, and weight loss. Short-term pilot studies have also shown that incentive-based
      strategies can improve electronically-monitored rates of adherence to HAART in the US, and a
      recent study in Africa showed that a small incentive approximately doubled the rate that
      individuals returned to learn the results of their HIV test. However, to date there is no
      experience with the use of incentive-based interventions to improve engagement into care and
      risk-reduction among out-of-care HIV-infected DUs in developing world settings. The
      investigators propose to conduct pilot randomized trial comparing a voucher incentive
      strategy to a control condition to improve engagement in HIV care and HIV treatment outcomes
      among out-of-care, treatment-eligible, HIV-infected DUs in Chennai, India. Subjects in the
      incentive arm will be eligible to earn incentive vouchers for 1) initiating HAART at a
      government-sanctioned HIV treatment clinic, 2) adherence to scheduled follow-up visits at the
      HIV clinic, and 3) achieving suppression of HIV RNA. Subjects will be enrolled from a mature
      research venue in Chennai, YR Gaitonde Centre for Substance Abuse-related Research (YRGCSAR),

      Acute kidney injury is more frequent and the mortality rate would be as high as 50-60% when
      the renal replacement therapy was needed. Many studies about the timing of start and
      discontinuation of dialysis, dialysis dose, dialyzer, anticoagulation and dialysates were
      initiated but the results were still controversial. In addition, more new biomarkers were
      found to predict the outcome of acute kidney injury and these biomarkers may play an
      important role for the dilemma of aforementioned studies.

      This observational prospective study has two objectives:

        1. To find the predictors of outcome for the acute kidney injury with renal replacement
           therapy and determine the appropriate method.

        2. To find the relationship between new biomarkers and acute kidney injury and determine
           whether it can be a factor for the monitor of the response of the renal replacement
           therapy.

NCT01039909,A Clinical Study to Assess the Effects of SRT2104 Upon Immobilization-Induced Skeletal Muscle Atrophy in Healthy Human Volunteers,"
      The main purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of SRT2104 upon energy production
      in muscle (specifically the maximum amount of energy produced with muscle contraction), how
      much sugar and fat are stored in the muscle, and the size of the muscle after receiving 2.0 g
      of SRT2104 or placebo given in capsule form once a day for 28 days including a 14 day knee
      and lower leg immobilisation period during the final 14 days of dosing.

      Imaging methods, muscle biopsies and exercise tests will be used in the study to see whether
      the following measurements change after taking SRT2104 for 28 days, including an immobilised
      knee and lower leg for the final 14 days of dosing.

      i) energy reaching the muscles ii) muscle strength iii) changes in the structure of the
      muscle

      This study will also investigate the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of 2.0 g of
      SRT2104 administered orally once daily for 28 consecutive days. The investigation of
      pharmacokinetics of SRT2104 allows us to gather information regarding:

      i) how long it takes for the drug to be absorbed and detected in the blood ii) how much we
      can detect iii) how long we can detect it for iv) how often we need to give the drug to
      maintain a steady amount in the blood.

      SRT2104 will be given to healthy subjects aged between 18 and 40 years old. Subjects will
      participate in this single centre study for approximately 79 days. The study consists of 11
      outpatient clinic visits and 4 telephone calls (including a prescreen call to determine

NCT01040195,Combination Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs (DMARDs) Versus Sulfasalazine in Inflammatory Back Pain,"
      Till now no drug has been conclusively shown to affect the natural course of the inflammatory
      back ache in seronegative spondylarthropathies. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
      (NSAIDS) have been the main stay of treatment for these diseases for long. Despite providing
      good pain relief, they are largely ineffective in altering the natural course of these
      diseases. However, very often, in spite of therapy, pain and discomfort continues in these
      patients with recurrent exacerbations. Other drugs have been tried in these patients.

      The DMARDS (Disease Modifying Anti Rheumatic Drugs) are a group of drugs which have come into
      prominence following their remarkable efficacy in the management of Rheumatoid Arthritis,
      another chronic inflammatory autoimmune arthritis. The major drugs which come in this group
      are Methotrexate, Sulfasalazine, Hydroxychloroquine and Leflunomide. Of these drugs, the most
      well studied drug in Spondylarthropathy is Sulfasalazine. Trials have shown variable results
      of response of spondyloarthropathy to sulfasalazine. The other major DMARD tried is
      methotrexate. Though large well controlled trials are lacking, the available data on its
      efficacy in spondyloarthropathy has not been favorable. Leflunomide, the other major DMARD
      has also fared poorly in a controlled trial in ankylosing spondylitis. There is at present
      inadequate data regarding the efficacy of Hydroxychloroquine.

      The discovery of anti TNF-α have been the major breakthrough in the management of ankylosing
      spondylitis (AS) and Spondyloarthropathies (SpA). These drugs, besides providing symptomatic
      improvement, also produce improvement in the indices of disease activity as Bath Ankylosing
      Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) and the Assessment of Spondylo-Arthritis
      International Society (ASAS). Besides, the enormous cost, incurred at a rate of about Rs
      700,000/- per annum, put it out of reach of the majority of affected population. Add to these
      is the increased risk of tuberculosis and fungal infections, a major problem in India.

      In this background there is severe and pressing need for alternate safe and effective drugs
      in the management of these diseases. It is here that the combination DMARD therapy assumes
      importance as a potential safe and cheaper alternative.

      We aim to assess the efficacy of combination DMARD therapy in patients with early
      inflammatory chronic backache in patients with sero negative spondyloarthropathies.

NCT01040650,Metabolic Features of Post-Myopathy Patients Associated With Statin Treatment,"
      Statins are a class of drugs given to lower cholesterol. Although statins are considered to
      be generally safe, some studies show that about 10% of people on statins develop
      muscle-related symptoms, from fatigue (tiredness), weakness, cramping, pain and sometimes a
      lifethreatening muscle breakdown condition known as rhabdomyolysis. In some, these symptoms
      may greatly affect their daily activities. One consideration why symptoms develop in only
      some patients is that they may have an underlying problem in the way their muscles use fats
      to produce energy. In these patients, the muscles are not able to fully utilize fats and so
      they become tired more easily. Fat within the muscle can also affect how your body uses a
      hormone called insulin, which affects your blood sugar levels. The investigators are
      specifically interested in previous statin users and determine if the muscle symptoms are
      related to changes in energy and sugar use. We propose to enroll patients who have developed
      muscle side effects on previous statin treatment and have since discontinued statin
      treatment.

      Our aim is to compare the metabolic parameters in these patients to age and gender-matched
      normal individuals.

NCT01041248,Single Patient Study to Treat Relapsing Polychondritis With Tocilizumab,"
      Relapsing polychondritis (RP) is a rare, immune-mediated disease associated with inflammation
      in cartilaginous structures and other tissues throughout the body. Prognosis can be poor,
      especially in cases where there is acute involvement of the laryngotracheal cartilages
      leading to airway destruction, which are resistant to treatments such as corticosteroids,
      immunosuppressive or cytotoxic drugs. The pathogenesis remains unclear although it is thought
      that autoimmune reactions to antigens present in cartilages, such as type II collagen and
      matrilin may evoke symptoms. There are no known clinical or laboratory measures that predict
      the expression of specific disease manifestations or the overall disease course. Two recently
      published case reports have shown an association with elevated serum IL-6 levels and
      relapsing polychondritis. In these case reports, both patients with refractory relapsing
      polychondritis were treated with tocilizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody to the
      Interleukin 6 receptor, and achieved sustained response to the drug. This single patient
      trial aims to evaluate the response to Tocilizumab in an eight year old boy with relapsing
      polychondritis who has been shown to have elevated serum IL-6 levels and who has responded
      poorly to conventional therapies. The study hypothesis is that Tocilizumab will be able to
      control the disease in this patient.

      Stem cell transplant is an important therapeutic option for pediatric patients with relapsed
      or refractory leukemia. Although, full myeloablative transplants are widely used for patients
      with acute leukemia, myeloablative chemo-radiotherapy may not be feasible in some specific
      settings. These settings include 1) patients with pre-existing health issues and organ
      toxicities; 2) patients who have relapsed post-ablative transplant and need a second stem
      cell transplant; and 3) leukemia patients with advanced disease who have been heavily
      pre-treated. Clofarabine, a new purine nucleoside anti-metabolite, has the advantage of
      significant antileukemic activity in addition to its possible immuno-suppressive properties.

NCT01043354,TACTICS (Targeting Adherence to Cholesterol-lowering Therapy to Improve Control Study),"
      Background:

      This is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of two novel behavioral interventions to enhance
      treatment adherence and improve low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) in diabetes. Among
      adults with diabetes, high LDL greatly increases their risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD).
      Despite the proven efficacy of LDL control(<100 mg/dL) in preventing CVD, the control rate is
      low. Poor adherence to treatment(diet, exercise and medication) is the main reason for this
      poor control.

      Aims: This study will test two telephone-delivered interventions, a Transtheoretical
      stage-matched intervention (SMI) and a Prospect theory-based framing effects intervention
      (FEI). The investigators hypothesize that both SMI and FEI will be more effective in
      improving LDL control than an attention placebo intervention (API) at 6 months. SMI and FEI
      will also be more effective in increasing adherence to medications, diet and exercise than
      API at 6 months.

      Methods:

      The investigators will recruit 246 adults with diabetes and high LDL despite being on
      medications. Key outcomes are adherence to diet, exercise and medication, and LDL control.
      The interventions will be standardized and fidelity of intervention maintained. Using a
      blinded RCT the investigators will test the effect of SMI and FEI compared to API on LDL
      control and adherence. All analyses will be intent to treat.

      Significance:

      This project will provide important information to improve diabetes-related behavior and lead
      to the implementation of novel interventions for lowering LDL in primary care settings among
      adults with diabetes. It may also provide the scientific rationale to use such approaches to

      (e.g. cholecystectomy) in selected patient collectives. In 2008 Lacy at al. published the
      experience with a transvaginal sigmoidectomy as a first in human report. The aim of this
      prospective data collection is to evaluate the feasibility and safety of the transvaginal
      hybrid anterior resection in the clinical routine.

      Therefore all patients giving the informed consent to the transvaginal hybrid anterior
      resection will be included and assessed concerning feasibility to perform the transvaginal
      approach and complete the operation transvaginally.

NCT01043757,Financial Incentives for Increasing Exercise,"
      Participants will be employees of Genzyme who volunteer to participate in a study on
      motivating healthy behaviors, involving giving them goals for taking a certain number of
      steps per day, and increasing that number over time. Participants will wear pedometers and
      upload their data to a website that allows them to monitor their progress, and have the
      opportunity to win money based on meeting their step goals.

      Interested employees will schedule a day and time to complete a health screening at a ""Health
      Fair"" at their place of employment, to ensure that they are healthy enough to participate; at
      this time participants will also complete the investigators baseline dependent measures, and
      receive a pedometer. After a one-week baseline period during which they wear the pedometer
      and the investigators establish their typical number of steps per day, eligible participants
      will then be assigned to one of four treatments - a ""no incentive"" control condition, and
      three conditions in which they are entered into different kinds of monetary lotteries if they
      have met their step goals for that day. Participants' initial goal will be based on their
      steps during the baseline period, and the goal will increase by 250 steps each week, for a
      total of 12 weeks. After these 3 months, the incentives portion of the experiment ends, but
      participants continue to wear their pedometers and upload their data for an additional 6
      months. At 3 months, 6 months, and then at the study end at 9 months, participants again
      complete the investigators dependent measures at follow-up Health Fairs at their place of

NCT01045135,The Effect of Pregnancy and Labour on the Pelvic Floor Diagnosed With 3D and 4D Ultrasound,"
      Injuries to the pelvic floor muscles and fascias during delivery and childbirth may lead to
      urinary incontinence (25-45 %), faecal incontinence (11-45%), pelvic organ prolapse (7-23%),
      sexual dysfunction (15-33 %) and chronic pain syndromes (4-15%). Pelvic floor muscle injuries
      are not easy to diagnose as they are not visible when looking at surface anatomy during a
      standard gynaecological examination. The investigators are therefore in urgent need of better
      tools to diagnose these injuries. Having a reliable and easily accessible tool enables
      studies of the consequences of such pelvic floor muscle injuries. It also makes it possible
      for us to explore the effect of interventions such as pelvic floor muscle training and
      surgery in patients with and without pelvic floor muscle injuries. The investigators have
      previously presented data to support the reliability and the validity of the three and four
      dimensional (3 and 4D) ultrasound technique used to define pelvic floor muscle anatomy in
      healthy volunteers and have now a tool to study women before and after delivery. At the
      Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Akershus University Hospital there are
      approximately 4500 deliveries annually and 1500 women are giving birth for the first time.

      Challenges: The invitation to participate in the study will be given to all women expecting
      their first child fulfilling inclusion criteria. The biggest challenges in the project will
      be logistical. To be able to inform, recruit and follow women having their first child is a
      challenge in it self.

      Applications: If it is possible to identify a risk group for pelvic floor injuries before
      delivery, it might be ethical to recommend a prophylactic caesarean section to avoid
      disabling incontinence and prolapse later in life.

      Hepatitis C is the leading cause of chronic liver disease in industrialized countries, and is
      the most common indication for liver transplantation. In the Western world, the absolute
      majority of cases of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection are related to the use of injectable
      narcotic drugs. Most injecting drug users contract HCV infection within the first years after
      starting injecting drug use. The aim of this study is to study hepatitis C in a cohort of
      patients registered in clinics providing maintenance therapy for opiate dependence in three
      metropolitan areas of Sweden. The cohort is defined as all patients registered in these three
      clinics at the date of study initiation. The study contains four parts:

      Part I: the first part of the study aims to evaluate the prevalence of HCV exposure in the
      cohort and the proportion of anti-HCV positive participants with chronic infection.

      Part II: Patients with chronic HCV infection will be offered further investigation of chronic
      liver disease, including liver biopsy, for selection of candidates for antiviral therapy and
      identification of risk factors for development of severe liver disease.

      Part III: Based on the results of these investigations, patients will be considered for
      antiviral therapy. Indications for such therapy will mainly be clinical and/or histological
      signs of chronic liver disease with fibrosis. All patients will receive weight-based doses of
      pegylated interferon-alfa-2b and ribavirin.

NCT01046734,Virus Shedding and Environmental Deposition of a Novel Influenza Virus,"
      An influenza pandemic has recently been declared, involving the novel A(H1N1) 'swine flu'
      virus. This has spread to almost 100 countries worldwide in less than two months, causing
      widespread disease so far in Mexico, USA and Canada. It is highly likely that over the next
      12 months, many countries including the UK will be affected by widespread illness. In the UK
      this wave of intense flu activity is most likely to occur in late autumn 2009.

      Very little is known about the new H1N1 pandemic virus. For example we do not know how long
      the virus is excreted by infected humans and how much virus is spread to surfaces and carried
      in the air. This is very important to know as soon as possible because it affects the advice
      that will be given to healthcare workers about controlling the spread of infection to
      themselves and other patients. Similarly we need this information so we can give good quality
      advice to families who will have to look after each other in their own homes.

      The best way to obtain this information is to ask patients who get pandemic flu soon (in
      August, September and October) to help us by agreeing to give a daily nose swab sample for
      just over one week so we can see how much virus is in the nose day by day and how quickly
      this disappears. At the same time we will take samples from hard surfaces in a patient's room
      or home and sample the air using a special filter device. We can then work out how much virus
      is being excreted, how long the 'danger period' is, whether surfaces are more or less
      important than the air that we breathe (in terms of catching the virus) and if we can advise
      on a 'safe distance' from the patient, beyond which there is relatively little chance of
      catching the illness.

      Purpose of the present research project is to study a new in-vivo test for abnormal platelet
      function and to study the effect of certain drugs on clinical bleeding. This is a randomized
      clinical trial of a new in-vivo test of platelet function known as the bleeding volume
      test(BVT)which relies on an on-line measurement system. This trial will assess the
      sensitivity and specificity of the new BVT by studying the effects of aspirin which is known
      to affect platelet function in-vivo. This is not a clinical trial of drugs. This is a
      clinical trial of a novel in-vivo on-line laboratory test.

      The BVT measures the total volume of blood in the discrete blotches of blood on the blotter
      paper during the BT test and thus the BVT gleans valuable additional information from the
      bleeding time test (BTT)procedure. We hypothesize that the BV test will be a more accurate,
      specific and sensitive test for diagnosing platelet function abnormalities and for detecting
      a person's bleeding tendency compared to the BTT, and commercially available in-vitro
      platelet function tests.

NCT01047800,Functional Gastrointestinal Disorder Screening Program - A Randomized Controlled Trial,"
      Background:

      Functional gastrointestinal disorder (FGID) is the most common gastrointestinal disease in
      daily clinical practice. The disease is symptomatic but has no identifiable cause by standard
      diagnostic tests such as endoscopy. It is characterized by its frequent relapses and thus the
      disease causes a significant level of stress and anxiety to patients. Due to the complexity
      and chronicity of the disease, it is believed that appropriate counseling on the nature and
      management of the disease is necessary to decrease patient's anxiety level and improve
      quality of life.

      Indication:

      Patients who have symptoms suggestive of FGID including non-erosive gastroesophageal reflux
      disease (NERD), functional dyspepsia (FD) or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).

      Aim:

      To validate the effectiveness of counseling in patients suffering from FGID.

      Method:

      Patients recruited to the study will follow the usual management of patients attending the
      Gastroenterology specialty clinic in Prince of Wales Hospital. Standard blood tests and
      endoscopy will be performed. Standard medication will be given to the patients for 8 weeks
      after endoscopy and the patients will come back to the specialty clinic for a final visit.

      The patient will be given an ""on-demand follow up within 1 year"" option at final visit. The
      patient will decide if he/she wants to come back to our specialty clinic to follow up his/her
      problem within one year.

      Follow-up after Final Visit Follow-up questionnaires will be mailed to patients 6 months, 1
      and 2 years after Final visit.

      Randomization:

      All the patients will be randomized into two groups in First Visit: 1) Control group, and 2)
      Counseling group. Both groups of patients will follow the above protocol, except that 2 extra
      counseling sessions will be arranged for the Counseling group immediately after visiting the
      physician.

NCT01047930,The Effect of Exercise on Acute Nicotine Withdrawal,"
      The primary aim of this project is to test the effect of exercise on acute nicotine
      withdrawal. Acute nicotine withdrawal is characterized by a complex array of symptoms
      associated with increased risk of relapse among individuals attempting smoking cessation. The
      available remedies do not target all aspects of withdrawal. For example, pharmacologic
      treatments reduce withdrawal-based craving, but have no effect on cue-related craving,
      altered sleep, and mood disturbances during withdrawal. Therefore, non-pharmacologic
      behavioral techniques with the potential to attenuate persistent withdrawal symptoms are
      needed. We hypothesized that exercise can be a valid non-pharmacologic strategy to improve
      these domains.

      The goal of this research is to continue to develop a model of infection with Campylobacter
      jejuni, a bacterium that causes food and water-borne disease (mainly diarrhea). The
      objectives are to 1) determine if healthy subjects develop short-term (<6 month) protection
      to reinfection with C. jejuni; and 2) characterize the immune responses to C. jejuni
      infection. Information obtained will be used in development of a vaccine against
      Campylobacter infections.

      Volunteers will be screened for eligibility within 60 days prior to enrollment. Screening
      will include obtaining informed consent prior to any study procedure. This will be followed
      by medical history, physical examination, review of current medications, blood samples for
      safety labs (WBC, Hct, Hgb, platelet count; chemistry panel; screening for HIV, HLA-B27, HBV,
      and HCV); urine pregnancy testing for females. Stool will be tested for infection.

      Eligible volunteers will be enrolled in the study and admitted to the GCRC on Day -1. They
      will drink a measured dose of C. jejuni on Day 0, and followed for approximately 9 inpatient
      days, during which time the investigators expect at least 75% to develop a diarrheal illness,
      which will be promptly treated with replacement fluids (oral or IV, as indicated) and
      antibiotics. During the inpatient period, subjects will be assessed for any adverse events,
      and blood and stool specimens will be analyzed for markers of infection and markers of immune
      response. Subjects must have resolved or resolving symptoms and two negative stool cultures
      ≥12 hours apart to be eligible for discharge, and will be seen in outpatient follow-up at 21,
      28, 35, 60, and 90 days for additional AE assessments and blood and stool analysis.

      Eight subjects will return for redosing approximately 98 days after the initial dose, with
      the same inpatient and outpatient follow-up as above. Few or none should develop a diarrheal
      illness. Four naïve (previously unexposed) subjects will also receive the dose on Day 98 to
      confirm a 75% illness rate with this dose. They will be followed as the initial group was.
      All participants will be assessed by phone 6 months after the final dose they received.

NCT01048632,Pilot Study of the Safety and Efficacy of Oxandrolone in the Prevention and Treatment of Malnutrition in Infants,"
      Oxandrolone is an anabolic steroid, marketed in the United States as an adjunctive therapy to
      combat weight loss resulting from chronic infection, extensive surgery, severe trauma,
      protein catabolism associated with prolonged administration of corticosteroids, and for the
      relief of bone pain accompanying osteoporosis. In children, it has been used to prevent and
      treat growth failure associated with severe burns (≥ 40% of total body surface area),
      Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Turner's syndrome, constitutional delay of growth and puberty,
      and chronic wasting in HIV-positive pediatric patients. Other applications in children have
      included treatment of central idiopathic precocious puberty, hereditary angioedema, and
      bilateral congenital anorchia. Growth failure is a common feature of infants with complex
      congenital heart disease, and can adversely affect outcome. This therapy has not been
      previously implemented in neonates thus we will evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      administering oxandrolone to improve growth in neonates with complex congenital heart disease

NCT01040663,Isocaloric Dietary Interventions for Insulin Resistance and the Metabolic Syndrome,"
      In recent decades, the prevalence of obesity has increased dramatically in the United States.
      Obesity has been associated with an increased risk of the metabolic syndrome, which is
      characterized by a cluster of metabolic derangements, including insulin resistance, high
      blood sugar, high triglycerides, low high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, high
      blood pressure, and inflammation. Lifestyle interventions, including dietary modification,
      physical activity, and weight loss, form the basis of treatment for individuals with the
      metabolic syndrome. However, the optimal composition of the diet is not known at this time.
      Furthermore, due to hormonal and metabolic changes that accompany weight loss, most people
      find it very difficult to maintain significant weight reductions over time. As a result,
      weight regain is exceedingly common.

NCT01040104,Prospective Clinical Trials on Skin Wound Healing in Young and Aged Individuals,"
      Regular wound healing follows a well-ordered sequence of overlapping phases: inflammation,
      proliferation, maturation and remodelling.

      In the young, damage to an organ mostly triggers fully regenerative mechanisms called
      ""primary"" wound healing. Repeated damage in young individuals may cause ""secondary"" wound
      healing eg. scar formation reflecting a rescue program, in which reorganisation has failed.

      Organ failure in the ageing organism is characterized by a progressive loss of its capability
      to achieve an orderly reactivation of organ repair, and results in a combination of chronic
      inflammation and fibroproliferative, non-regenerative repair affecting several organs,
      including lung, liver and skin.

      RESOLVE's objective is to identify, characterize, and validate molecular targets responsible
      for shifting primary organ repair towards fibroproliferative wound healing as a result of an
      age-dependent loss of regulatory control.

      The structured approach is based on

        -  different forms of wound healing,

        -  different human diseases and

        -  different genetic backgrounds,

NCT01042054,"Comparison of Analgesic Methods, and Their Effects on Patient Recovery, Following Liver Surgery","
      The provision of adequate pain relief following major liver surgery is essential, not only
      for patient comfort, but for the prevention of complications, such as chest infection.

      Commonly, pain relief in the first few days after surgery is provided by epidural analgesia.
      Drugs are delivered to the area around the spinal cord, through a fine plastic tube placed in
      the patients back, and this blocks sensation from the abdomen downwards, thereby providing
      effective pain relief without the need for opiate analgesia (e.g. morphine). Opiate analgesia
      can cause nausea, drowsiness and constipation, and its use should be minimised. Epidurals,
      however, can be associated with some problematic side effects. Low blood pressure is commonly
      encountered, and not only can its treatment be associated with complications, but patients
      are often confined to bed.

      Mobility can also be limited if muscle function in the legs, (in addition to sensation), is
      inadvertently affected by the epidural drugs. Other problems associated with epidural use are
      the relatively common failure of the technique to provide adequate analgesia (20%), and some
      extremely rare but potentially disastrous complications of epidural insertion.

      An alternative technique, is the provision of pain relief directly into the wound, via one or
      more multi-holed tubes(catheters), placed either in or close to the wound. This technique
      alone does not provide as effective analgesia as a functioning epidural, but when combined
      with other intravenous or oral analgesia, has been shown to be effective following a variety
      of surgical procedures.

      It is hypothesised that, following major liver surgery, the use of this latter technique may
      result in superior outcome and faster recovery, when compared with epidural, by avoidance of
      the side effects and complications discussed above.

      In this study, patients scheduled to undergo major liver surgery at the Royal Infirmary of
      Edinburgh with be randomly assigned to receive the first two days of pain relief either by
      epidural, or by wound catheter plus additional analgesia. Both groups will then receive an
      identical oral analgesic regime for the remainder of the hospital stay.

      Outcomes of interest will include the quality of pain relief attained, patient mobility,
      frequency of complications, and overall recovery time.

NCT01040026,Expanded Natural Killer (NK) Cells for Multiple Myeloma Study,"
      High-dose chemotherapy with melphalan and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
      (HSCT) is considered standard treatment for patients with multiple myeloma. While autologous
      HSCT may induce remission in patients resistant to standard chemotherapy, and has been shown
      to lead to long-lasting disease control in a subgroup of patients, the procedure is not
      curative. Given enough time and in the absence of a competing cause of death, all patients
      eventually relapse after auto-HSCT.

      The only potentially curative approach currently available in the treatment of multiple
      myeloma (MM) is stem cell trans-plantation from an allogeneic donor. Allogeneic HSCT
      eradicates residual myeloma cells through T-cell mediated graft-versus-tumor effects.
      Allogeneic HSCT is, however, associated with significant risk of graft-versus-host disease
      and its use is therefore limited to younger patients with high risk dis-ease. Malignant
      plasma cells in multiple myeloma are also sensitive to natural killer cell lysis. Natural
      killer cells do not cause graft-versus-host disease, which has led to interest in their
      therapeutic use in patients with multiple myeloma.

      We have previously shown that immunomagnetic separation of a highly pure NK cell product from
      a leukapheresis is possible and that these cells can be expanded up to 100-fold in a
      GMP-compatible setting. The current study aims to test the tolerability and feasibility of
      infusions of in vitro expanded haploidentical NK cells for patients after melphalan 200mg/m2
      high dose chemotherapy and autologous HSCT in 10 patients. If feasible, the data will provide

NCT01041820,Critical Periods of Exercise,"
      Early childhood (~3-7 years of age) is an important window for determining body composition
      trajectory and may be a critical period for the development of tissue partitioning patterns
      that influence obesity risk. As adiposity accelerates during this critical period,
      deposition/ preservation of fat stores may be sustained at the 'expense' of other tissues;
      i.e. energy homeostasis may be inherently biased toward fat gain. The type and amount of
      tissue mass accrued in early childhood has implications for metabolic profile,
      glucose/insulin homeostasis, hormone profile and resting energy expenditure.

      The interplay between fat and bone deposition represents a physiologic trait enabling the
      body to choose between shuttling 'energy' towards accrual of a particular tissue. Plausibly
      the phenotype underlying obesity and diabetes risk may be determined by the differentiation
      of cell type (adipocyte, osteocyte, etc.) during this early stage of growth and development.
      In vitro studies demonstrate transdifferentiation under the influence of specific external
      stimuli, which can switch phenotypes toward other cell lineages. Further, rodent models have
      demonstrated that exposure to stimuli (exercise) early in life may prevent excess fat mass
      accrual in adulthood, even when the stimulus is later removed (animals are no longer
      exercising). Children's early experiences (engagement in physical activity vs. sedentary
      behavior) may 'environmentally induce' alterations in body composition and predispose
      individuals to obesity throughout life.

      Aim 1. To examine the associations between body composition via DXA and objectively-measured
      physical activity/inactivity.

        1. Hypothesis 1.1: There is a positive association between physical activity and bone mass.

        2. Hypothesis 1.2: There is a positive association between sedentary behavior and total fat
           mass.

           Aim2. To examine the associations between adipose tissue distribution via MRI and
           objectively-measured physical activity/inactivity.

           marrow adipose tissue.

NCT01043640,Allogeneic Bone Marrow Transplant for Inherited Metabolic Disorders,"
      Rationale: Chemotherapy administration before a donor stem cell transplant is necessary to
      stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. When healthy stem
      cells from a donor are infused into the patient, the donor white blood cells can provide the
      missing enzyme that causes the metabolic disease. Sometimes the transplanted cells from a
      donor can make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving a monoclonal
      antibody, alemtuzumab, before transplant and cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil before
      and after transplant may stop this from happening. This may be an effective treatment for
      inherited metabolic disorders.

      Purpose: The design of this study is to achieve donor cell engraftment in patients with
      standard-risk inherited metabolic diseases with limited peri-transplant morbidity and
      mortality. This will be achieved through the administration of the chemotherapy regimen
      described. The intention is to follow transplanted patient for years after transplant

      to be offered participation by a patient information form given to patients at the time of
      admission, as well as oral information about the study. Written informed consent will be
      obtained by the investigators after patients have had adequate time to consider their
      participation in the study.

      Participating patients will be examined clinically for dermatologic pathologies at a single
      visit. In the case of signs of dermatologic disease, investigators are going to recommend
      further diagnostic procedures to the physician in charge and/or the referring physician,
      depending on the urgency of the suspected diagnosis. This procedure is meant to avoid giving
      referring physicians the impression that active patient acquisition for the department of
      Dermatology is an aim of this study. Diagnostic procedures that are performed upon suspicion
      of a specific dermatologic disease at the Division of Internal Medicine are going to be
      performed during the hospitalisation period. All other diagnostic or operative procedures are
      going to be advised to the referring physician.

      Study participants are going to be interviewed by the investigators about impairment in QOL
      of their illnesses. Two separate questionnaires are going to be filled in by each
      participant. For measurement of general QOL, the widely used SF-12 questionnaire (8

      whom the female partner ovulates regularly successfully obtain their goal of delivering a
      healthy child, whose use will result in low rates of multiple gestations. The central
      hypothesis is that, in infertile ovulatory women undergoing ovarian stimulation (OS) and
      intrauterine insemination (IUI), the use of aromatase inhibitors (AI) will stimulate the
      ovaries sufficiently to produce no reduction in the rate of pregnancy, while significantly
      reducing the numbers of multiple gestational pregnancies that result from stimulation with
      clomiphene citrate (CC) or follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). The rationale for the proposed
      research is that reduction of multiple pregnancy rates could significantly reduce maternal

NCT01046045,Everolimus Rescue Immunosuppression in the Treatment of Chronic Allograft Dysfunction in Renal Transplant Recipients,"
      Despite the remarkable improvement in short-term patient and graft survival among the
      recipients of kidney transplants, the progressive renal dysfunction (chronic allograft
      dysfunction) accompanied by chronic interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy, vascular
      occlusive changes and glomerulosclerosis remains the chief cause of graft loss. As a result
      of this damage from immunologic and non-immunologic injury, the long-term survival of kidney
      transplants has changed little during the past decade. And, among the non-immunologic
      factors, calcineurin inhibitor nephrotoxicity has been shown to be the most common factor
      leading to long-term graft damage and progression to graft failure. This is further supported
      by the previous finding that long-term use of calcineurin inhibitor-based therapy leads to
      deterioration in kidney function, even in recipients of non-renal organ transplants.

      The growing interest in calcineurin inhibitor minimisation protocols to optimize renal
      transplant outcome offers a new therapeutic options in the management of patients with
      chronic allograft dysfunction. Recently, mammalian target-of-rapamycin inhibitors (mTOR
      inhibitors) including everolimus has been shown to achieve an improvement of long-term
      function through an early modulation of immunosuppressive regimen. In this aspect,
      percutaneous renal graft biopsy represents an important diagnostic tool to allow
      visualization of the lesions of chronic allograft dysfunction and therefore the ability to
      delineate the potential improvement after introduction of everolimus. Histologic and
      morphometric findings from a protocol-mandated biopsies obtained from renal transplant
      recipients who are suffering from chronic allograft dysfunction and treated with everolimus
      are needed to provide a clinical blueprint for the drug's efficacy, if confirmed.

NCT01046500,Myo-inositol Versus Metformin Administration in Post-menopausal Women With Metabolic Syndrome,"
      Myo-Inositol is classified as a member of the vitamin B complex. It is a constituent of
      living cells and is widespread in many food. It is involved in a number of biological
      processes, including insulin signal transduction, resulting in modulating insulin
      sensitivity. One hundred post-menopausal women from 50 to 60 years old, affected by metabolic
      syndrome (criteria are described in NIH ATP III) will be randomized into two groups: 50
      treated with myo-inositol 2 g twice per day and fifty treated with metformin for six months.
      Metformin is the drug usually used in diabetic and pre-diabetic conditions, as metabolic
      syndrome. The investigators hypothesize that the administration of myo-inositol would improve
      the insulin-receptor activity in these women, reducing insulin resistance as well as
      metformin.

NCT01046721,"Study Looking at Cardiovascular Effects of Exenatide, Its Blood Pressure Lowering Effect and Its Mechanisms","
      Exenatide is a new drug which lowers blood sugar (glucose) levels for people with type 2
      diabetes. It has significant advantages over other treatments such as insulin as it causes
      weight loss in a group of people that is generally overweight. Data from studies involving
      exenatide have shown that it also has an effect on blood pressure. The mechanism for the
      blood pressure lowering effect is not known and has not been investigated previously.
      Exenatide may have an effect on blood vessels throughout the body and gut to reduce blood
      pressure. 12 healthy men (18-45yr) will be studied on 2 occasions. Limb blood flow, skin
      blood flow, gut blood flow, blood pressure, and heart rate will be measured half hourly for 4
      hours. Blood samples (3ml) for insulin and glucose determination will be taken via a cannula
      and 3-way tap at the same time points. A dose of either 5μg exenatide or saline will be
      injected under the skin of the abdomen and a breakfast will be provided during the study. A

NCT01046747,Pre-drilling or Self Drilling External Fixation Pins,"
      Hypothesis

      There is no difference in the incidence of pin tract infection and pin loosening in case of
      lower extremity external fixators when self-drilling schanz pins are used with or without
      pre-drilling.

      Primary Objective

      The primary objective is to determine whether pre-drilling holes for external fixation pin
      insertion is superior to not pre-drilling holes for external fixation pin insertion in
      regards to the incidence of pin tract infection and pin loosening.

      Secondary Objective

      If any difference is found between the two techniques then, we will quantify and qualify
      those differences. The incidence of pin site infection and pin loosening in general will be
      determined and will also be stratified for site and size of pin. An attempt to identify risk
      factors for pin site infection will be made by observing the effect of secondary prognostic
      factors like mode of injury, diabetes, smoking, compartment syndrome, peripheral vascular
      disease, neurovascular injury. Interobserver reliability of the grading system for pin
      infection will also be determined.

NCT01046773,Vitamin D Supplementation as Non-toxic Immunomodulation in Children With Crohn's Disease,"
      IBD is caused by an abnormal immune response to the gut bacteria in people who are
      genetically predisposed. There has been a huge increase in the number of people diagnosed
      with IBD since World War II, likely due to changes in our environment. It is possible that
      the abundance of vitamin D in the body may be one of those environmental factors that the
      investigators can control to make patients with IBD better.

      Vitamin D acts on cells of the immune system and causes many effects, including the
      production of a ""natural antibiotic"" called cathelicidin. The investigators know that when
      people are supplemented with vitamin D, levels of cathelicidin produced by these immune cells
      increase. By supplementing children with Crohn's disease with vitamin D, the investigators
      may be able to alter their immune system ""naturally,"" making their disease better. A
      consensus of vitamin D experts believes that vitamin D levels need to reach a level of 40-70
      ng/mL in the blood in order to have effects on the immune system. Raising vitamin D levels to
      this range is one of the goals in the current study.

      Hypofunction of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor has been implicated in the
      pathophysiology of schizophrenia. To date, several reported trials on adjuvant NMDA-enhancing
      agents, including glycine and sarcosine (a glycine transporter I inhibitor), demonstrated
      clinical benefits for schizophrenia patients. This project aims to compare the efficacy and
      safety of sarcosine and combination of sarcosine and BE, as adjunctive therapy for
      schizophrenia, and to explore the possible synergistic effects of them. Sixty chronic
      schizophrenic inpatients will be enrolled in the 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled

NCT01048749,Interventional Study of Effects on Spine Height With Two Unloading Positions,"
      The purpose of this study is to test a physical therapy intervention for reducing pain in the
      low back and into the legs. With individuals over the age of 40 years, this pain may be
      associated to changes in back height from aging of the cushions between the back bones. When
      pain is caused from this, completion of different positions and rest periods have been shown
      to help reduce the pain, at least temporarily. This study will compare two such positions;
      1)floating in deep warm water with weights attached to the ankles, to take the load off of
      the spine, 2)lying on their back with hip and knees flexed to a 90 degree angle. The height
      of each person will be measured before and after completion of each intervention using a
      specially designed measuring tool.

           experience increase in spinal height when completing aquatic vertical suspension and/or
           land-based supine flexion.

        2. Subjects with low back and leg pain suggestive of nerve root compression syndrome will
           experience greater increase in height, greater reduction of pain intensity and location

NCT01048801,Role and Effectiveness of Rapid Diagnostic Tests in Home-based Management of Malaria,"
      Most malaria deaths occur within 48 hours of onset of symptoms, and in rural areas with poor
      access to health facilities, home management of malaria (HMM) can improve the timeliness of
      treatment and reduce malaria mortality by up to 50%. In order to maximize both coverage and
      impact, ACTs should be deployed in HMM programmes, as well as in formal health facilities. Up
      to 80% of malaria cases are treated outside the formal health sector and shops are frequently
      visited as the first (and in some cases only) source of treatment. Strategies to deploy ACTs
      in Africa thus also need to examine the role of shops in home management and to ensure that
      drugs sold are appropriate. The current practice of presumptive treatment of any febrile
      illness as malaria (both at health facilities and in the context of HMM) based solely on
      clinical symptoms without routine laboratory confirmation, results in significant over-use of
      antimalarial drugs. With ACT being a more costly regimen, it is important to be more
      restrictive in its administration and rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) provide a simple means of
      confirming malaria diagnosis in remote locations lacking electricity and qualified health
      staff.

      This study therefore proposes to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and
      cost-effectiveness of using RDTs to improve malaria diagnosis and treatment by
      community-based drug distributors.The accuracy of RDTs, and the acceptability of this
      approach, will be evaluated in both low and high transmission areas.

NCT01048905,Glutamine Therapy for Hemolysis-Associated Pulmonary Hypertension,"
      The primary hypothesis of this study is that glutamine supplementation will improve the
      erythrocyte glutamine/glutamate ratio, a biomarker of oxidative stress, hemolysis and
      pulmonary hypertension (PH) in sickle cell disease (SCD) and thalassemia (Thal) patients with
      PH. PH is defined as a tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity (TRV) on Doppler echocardiography >

      subsequently alter sickle red cell endothelial interaction that can be identified using
      endo-PAT technology through nitric oxide (NO) generation, leading to changes in biological
      markers, and clinical outcome. Specifically our second hypothesis is that oral glutamine will
      decrease biomarkers of hemolysis and adhesion molecules, and improve the imbalanced
      arginine-to-ornithine ratio that occurs in hemolytic anemias, leading to improved arginine
      bioavailability and clinical endpoints of endothelial dysfunction and PH in patients with SCD

      interventions, and outcomes. Thus, we attempt to design aquatic intervention activity for
      children with cerebral palsy to evaluate the effect of hydrotherapy.

      Purpose:

      To evaluate the effects of pediatric aquatic therapy on motor performance, daily activity and
      social participation in children with spastic cerebral palsy.

      Method:

      The study enrolled 27 children with spastic cerebral palsy aged from 4 to 12 years old.These
      children were dived into two groups: traditional rehabilitation therapy (control group), and
      hospital based pediatric aquatic therapy program. We evaluate the motor performance, daily

NCT01049698,Improving Muscle for Functional Independence Trial,"
      Aging is associated with declines in muscle strength, power, and overall functional ability
      that lead to disability and loss of independence. Furthermore, the existing high prevalence
      of obesity in the elderly is greatly exacerbating these aging-related declines in function.
      To date, regular exercise, especially resistance exercise, is the only known treatment to
      consistently improve muscle function and perhaps delay the onset of disability. However, not
      all individuals experience the same magnitude of benefit from a given exercise stimulus, and
      accumulating data show that obesity limits muscle adaptations to chronic exercise.Therefore,
      the proposed study is designed to determine the effects of caloric restriction on

NCT01043848,Treatment of Neurogenic Detrusor Overactivity: Early Versus Late Pudendal Nerve Stimulation in Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) Patients,"
      Background: Although a small group, special attention has to be given to lower urinary tract
      (LUT) dysfunctions in spinal cord injury (SCI) patients, as they also suffer under a loss of
      motor-sensory function and autonomic regulation next to the severe deficiencies in bladder
      and bowel control. Autonomic dysregulation linked with LUT dysfunction can cause autonomic
      dysreflexia with life threatening increases in blood pressure and there is still no concept
      for an early rehabilitation of bladder function after SCI.

      Hypothesis: We assume that inadequate reorganization of nerve fibres in SCI is a reason for
      spastic bladder dysfunction and vegetative dysregulation and that this can be positively
      influenced by early neuromodulation. We hypothesized that bladder dysfunction as well as
      autonomic dysreflexia will be positively affected.

      Specific aims: Evaluation, if external pudendal nerve stimulation (EPS) can positively
      influence LUT rehabilitation in SCI patients and if early initiation of stimulation is more
      effective compared to late initiation (after spinal shock).

      Experimental design: Prospective multicentre study in 36 SCI patients (24 treatment subjects,
      12 control subjects). EPS will be started either within 10 days after SCI (early stim group)
      or after cessation of spinal shock (late stim group). Effects on spastic bladder function and
      autonomic disinhibition will be assessed by urodynamics, vegetative tests, and by
      electrophysiological techniques.

      Expected value: If early EPS is effective and complete SCI patients benefit from this
      intervention; and if early onset of EPS has better and longer lasting effects than late onset
      stimulation, the findings will be of utmost relevance not only for bladder function but also
      to alleviate adverse phenomena such as autonomic dysreflexia. Neurostimulation may bear the
      opportunity to early reshape maladaptive neuroplasticity. This would be proof of an effective
      modulation and promotion of neuroplasticity, thus opening up new treatment options in the
      field of paraplegiology.

NCT01040273,Management of Postoperative Pain After Total Hip Arthroplasty,"
      Orthopedic surgery is reportedly among the most painful surgical procedures. Surgical damage
      following major orthopedic surgery often involves a large, deep incision with considerable
      tissue dissection and muscle, bone, and vascular exposure. Post-operative pain after such
      surgery is exacerbated on movement or by reflex spasms of the muscles, which may delay
      mobilization, reduce satisfaction, prolong hospitalization, and possibly increase medical
      costs.

      We design a prospective randomized study for postoperative pain control following total hip
      arthroplasty.

      Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) array technology has been used in numerous studies on

      Because chromosomal abnormalities have still been associated with obesity, we can expect that

      deleted or duplicated loci in these obese patients would mean that these loci include genes
      implicated in obesity. This will permit to propose new gene(s) involved in obesity. (In

NCT01041833,Effect of All-trans Retinoic Acid With Chemotherapy Based on Paclitaxel and Cisplatin As First-line Treatment of Patients With Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer and Expression of RAR-alfa and RAR-beta as Response Biomarker,"
      BACKGROUND Platinum-based chemotherapy (CT) is the standard treatment for advanced
      non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Unfortunately, the survival and response rate (RR) to CT
      is poor. There is great interest in new treatment strategies. One of this new strategies
      include the use of retinoids such as atRA. The synergistic effect of cytotoxic agents with
      retinoids has been demonstrated in lung cancer. At the INCan, our work group carried out a
      phase II study trial that included 107 patients with advanced NSCLC. They were randomized to
      receive atRA (20-mg/m2) or placebo combined with 80 mg/m2 of cisplatin and 175 mg/m2 of
      paclitaxel. The results showed a significant increase in the RR of the atRA group, reaching
      55.8% ( 95% CI; 46.6-64.9%) compared with 25.4% (95% CI, 21.3-29.5%; p = 0.001) in patients
      who received placebo. Median Progression-free survival (PFS) in the atRA group was 8.9
      months, while for those of placebo, PFS was 6.0 months (p = 0.008). There were no significant
      differences in the grade 3-4 side effects between groups, except for hypertriglycemia, which
      presented with greater frequency in the atRA group (p = 0.05). Immunohistochemical stains
      determine the RAR B2 expression in 6 of 60 tumor samples analyzed; however, all samples
      expressed RAR B2 in adjacent normal tissue.

      HYPOTHESIS Patients with NSCLC who receive the scheme combined with first-line CT plus 45
      mg/m2 of atRA will have a greater PFS and RR to CT with an acceptable toxicological profile.

      OBJECTIVES

        1. Obtain a greater RR to CT and PFS in patients with advanced NSCLC who receive cisplatin-
           and paclitaxel-based CT combined with a 45-mg/m2 daily dose of atRA with an acceptable
           toxicological profile .

        2. Evaluate the benefit of RAR beta and RAR alfa expression as a response biomarker.

      METHODS Three hundred and thirty patients with advanced NSCLC will be included to receive
      Paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 and Cisplatin 80 mg/m2 (PC) every 21 days for 6 cycles. Patients will be
      randomized to receive ATRA 45 mg2/day or placebo 1 week before treatment until completing six
      cycles. Imaging studies will be performed prior and after two cycles of CT to assess
      response. RAR beta and RAR alfa expression will be analyzed by immunohistochemistry in lung
      tumoral tissue and in the adjacent lung tissue.

      This study is an investigational approach that uses immune cells, called ""T cells"", to kill

      in the body. T cells fight infections and can also kill cancer cells in some cases. However,
      right now T cells are unable to kill the cancer cells. For this reason we will put one gene
      into the T cells that allows them to recognize and kill the leukemia cells. This gene will be
      put in the T cells by a weakened virus. The gene will produce proteins in the T cells that
      help the T cells recognize the leukemia cells and possibly kill them. The doctors have found
      that T cells modified in this way can cure an ALL-like cancer in mice.

      The main goals of this study is to determine the safety and appropriate dose of these
      modified T cells in patients with ALL. This will be done in a ""clinical trial."" The dose of
      modified T-cells will depend on if you have disease present in your bone marrow or not. The

      Ionizing radiation is a toxic agent and widely accepted form of treatment for various types

      early and late skin effects. Radiation-induced dermatitis occurs in approximately 80% of
      patients. Important consequences of radiation-induced dermatitis include impairment of the
      quality of a patient's life due to pain and premature interruption of radiation treatment,
      which in turn, may be impair good local control of disease. The biological pathways
      responsible for acute radiation-induced dermatitis remain unclear. Currently, there is no

      The purpose of this study is to determine if EMD 1201081 in combination with cetuximab is
      more efficient than cetuximab alone to control the cancer.

      EMD 1201081 is an immune modulatory oligonucleotide (IMO) containing phosphorothioate
      oligodeoxynucleotide and acts as an agonist of Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9).

      EMD 1201081 has been studied in six clinical trials in over 170 subjects either as a
      monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapeutic agents or targeted therapies. Two studies
      have been conducted in healthy volunteers. In the other five studies, subjects with advanced

      In 2003, Surgeon General Richard Carmona suggested that low health literacy is ""one of the
      largest contributors to our nation's epidemic of overweight and obesity."" Over 26% of
      preschool children are now overweight or obese, and children who are overweight by age 24
      months are five times as likely as non-overweight children to become overweight adolescents.
      The aim of the study is to assess the efficacy of a low-literacy/numeracy-oriented
      intervention aimed at teaching pediatric resident physicians to promote healthy family
      lifestyles and prevent overweight among young children (age 0-2) and their families in

NCT01044654,Phase 1 Dose Escalation Study of Autologous T-cells Genetically Modified at the CCR5 Gene by Zinc Finger Nucleases in HIV-Infected Patients,"
      This research study is being carried out to study a new way to possibly treat HIV. This agent
      is called a ""Zinc Finger Nuclease"" or ZFN for short. ZFNs are proteins that can delete
      another protein named CCR5. This CCR5 protein is required for certain types of HIV (CCR5
      tropic) to enter into and infect your T-cells. T cells are one of the white blood cells used
      by the body to fight HIV. The most important of these are called ""CD4 T-cells.""

      Some People are born without CCR5 on their T-cells. These people remain healthy and are
      resistant to infection with HIV. Other people have a low number of CCR5 on their T-cells, and
      their HIV disease is less severe and is slower to cause disease (AIDS).

      Even with no detectable levels of HIV in the blood, HIV remains in some tissues in the body,
      primarily the gut tissue. HIV infects the CD4+ T-cells including in the blood and gut. The
      new treatment to be studied will involve removing white blood cell from the blood that
      contains CD4+ T-cells. The extracted CD4+ T-cells are then genetically modified by the ZFNs
      to be resistant to infection by HIV by removing the CCR5 gene from the surface of the CD4+ T
      cell where HIV enters the cell. Additional genetically modified cells are manufactured and
      then re-infused back into you. Researchers hope that these genetically modified cells will be
      resistant to infection by HIV and will be able to reproduce additional resistant CD4+ T-cells
      in your body.

      Laboratory studies have shown that when CD4+ T-cells are modified with ZFNs, HIV is prevented
      from killing the CD4+ T-cells. On the basis of these laboratory results, thre is the
      potential that ZFNs may work in humans infected with HIV and improve their immune system by
      allowing their CD4+ T-cells to survive longer.

      The purpose of this research study is to find out whether ""zinc finger"" modified CD4+ T-cells
      are safe to give to humans and find how ""zinc finger"" modified T-cell affects HIV.

      more effectively and therefore lead them to recover from asthma attacks faster than
      conventional continuous-output nebulizer devices. This study compares outcomes including
      hospital admission rates, number of nebulized treatments required, and patient/family
      satisfaction when a breath-actuated nebulizer device versus a conventional continuous-output

NCT01045213,Integrated Care Program for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease,"
      Integrated eHealth is an innovative, proactive approach to the management of patients with
      chronic cardiopulmonary disease. Our overall goal is to improve the health of patients by
      integrating guideline-based education, remote disease monitoring, coordinator-based disease
      management and healthcare provider-initiated therapy. Patients enrolled in the program
      receive a set of equipment, including a Health Buddy® telemonitor that connects to a normal
      telephone, as well as instruments to measure oxygen levels (pulse oximeter), lung function
      (spirometer) and activity (pedometer). Through the Health Buddy® patients receive
      guideline-based disease education in their own homes. The Health Buddy® also allows patients
      to transmit daily information about their symptoms, oxygen levels, lung function and ability
      to walk to program coordinators located at the University of Colorado Hospital. Our program
      coordinators are highly experienced nurses or respiratory therapists with expertise in the
      management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and congestive heart failure
      (CHF). Through this remote disease education/monitoring program, patients learn to take a
      more active role in the management of their own disease. However, once the coordinators
      identify early warning signs of a potential problem, patients are contacted and connected to
      their primary healthcare provider for early intervention. By this integrated approach to
      care, patients learn self-management techniques, physician communication is enhanced, and
      early interventions for problems are possible. We propose to target the Integrated eHealth
      Program to areas of Colorado that are highly impacted by COPD.

      Key Objectives: The key objectives are to improve COPD care in the 16 Colorado counties with
      high COPD mortality rates.

      Target Population: We will target patients with severe or very severe COPD.

      Expected Outcomes: We expect that this study will increase the use of evidence-based
      guidelines in the screening, diagnosis and treatment of COPD, resulting in improved
      quality-of-life and a reduction in healthcare utilization.

      after non-myeloablative conditioning.

      Co-infusion of MSC has been shown to facilitate engraftment of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)
      in an immunodeficient mouse model. In addition, it has been shown that infusion of third
      party MSC in HSC transplantation could be successfully used as treatment for grade II-IV
      steroid-refractory acute graft versus host disease.

      One hundred and twenty patients with HLA-mismatched donors will be included over 6 years at
      multiple centers across Belgium through the transplant committee of the Belgian Hematological
      Society. The conditioning regimen will consist of fludarabine and 2 Gy TBI, followed by the

NCT01045512,"The Role of the ""Inflammatory/ Pathogen Burden"" for Cardiac Ageing","
      In the elderly a chronic basal systemic inflammation prevails - which is evident by enhanced
      CRP or IL-6 plasma concentrations - and by compromised defense mechanisms against invading
      microbes. These alterations belong to the physiological ageing process of the immune system
      (immunosenescence) and are regarded as an inflammatory response towards lifelong antigen
      stress (""inflammatory/pathogen burden""). This lifelong antigen stress evokes an age-dependent
      basal inflammatory activation of innate immunity as well as a wasting of specific immunity:
      it is supposed that in the course of life-time due to a multitude of infectious/inflammatory
      events (""multiple hits"") an inflammatory stress prevails or ""inflammatory/pathogen burden""
      accumulates, which substantially contributes to an enhancement of the inflammatory parameters
      of natural immune response. Such enhanced inflammatory parameters characterize persons at
      increased risk of degenerative diseases like atherosclerosis or coronary heart disease. The
      risk is the higher, the higher the ""pathogen burden"". An impact of the inflammatory load on
      cardiac ageing has not yet been described.

      ""CARDIAC AGEING"", REFLECTED BY A NARROWING OF HEART RATE VARIABILITY: The physiological
      ageing process of the heart goes along with a narrowing of heart rate variability as shown by
      various groups, including our own. Arguments in favour of a causal relationship between
      inflammation and cardiac ageing come from an experimental study with healthy human volunteers
      who had received a low dose of endotoxin: such a proinflammatory stimulus leads to a
      reversible narrowing of heart rate variability (7). Also in senescence heart rate variability
      steadily declines, paralleled by a steady increase of basal inflammatory activity.

      The reduction of heart rate variability also is regarded as a sensitive parameter of
      autonomic dysfunction, which contributes to the compromise of cardiac reserve in old age.
      Apart from typical morphological features and functional deterioration, e.g. diastolic
      dysfunction, the senescent heart is typically characterized by a narrowed heart rate
      variability. Efforts have been made to estimate the cardiac age of an individual by this
      compromised heart rate variability, which may be divergent to the biological age. In recent
      years diverse approaches were proposed to measure cardiac age on the basis of heart rate
      variability. The published mathematical formulae were mostly validated with small patient
      groups and have presently not entered clinical practice. Still heart rate variability is an
      accepted surrogate parameter of cardiac ageing and is amenable by therapeutic measures, e.g.
      beta-blockade.

      The interaction between autonomic nervous system and inflammation is bilateral: thus vagal
      stimulation can improve heart rate variability and at the same time evoke anti-inflammatory
      action: this ""cholinergic anti-inflammatory"" reflex could make the basis for pharmacological
      interventions to confine overwhelming inflammatory response syndromes. The afferent vagal
      nerve, on the other hand, can be stimulated by inflammatory mediators and toxins (endotoxin,
      Interleukin-1), thus activating the efferent vagus to release acetylcholine, which can bind
      to a nicotinergic acetylcholine receptor on macrophages and thus interrupt cytokine release
      and limit the rise in the blood levels of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF, IL-6). The
      biological meaning of this reflex is to localise inflammatory reactions in the organism and
      prevent a spill of cytokines to the circulation. A functioning autonomic nervous system is
      thus mandatory to prevent overshooting of inflammatory response to infection and
      non-infectious stimuli. The link between cardiac ageing and autonomic dysfunction gives
      another argument in favour of the notion that autonomic dysfunction and pathogen/inflammatory
      load could be factors promoting cardiac ageing. This, on the other hand, implies the chance
      of slowing down the cardiac ageing process by successfully modulating the extent of autonomic
      dysfunction and the scope of ""pathogen/inflammatory burden"".

      THE NEED FOR A TRIAL:

      A possible causal relationship between basal inflammatory activation and cardiac ageing has
      not been established. This is the issue of the project proposal. In this trial the
      investigators strive to lower the ""pathogen/ inflammatory load"" by simple and safe measures.
      The investigators therefore chose treatment with statins, standardised physical training
      (both parameters of heart function and heart rate variability could thus be improved) and
      vaccinations against influenza and pneumococci to prevent a further enhanced ""pathogen/
      inflammatory burden"".

      nicotine. In addition to being involved in tobacco dependence, they are also involved in a
      variety of brain disorders, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Researchers are
      interested in developing better ways to study the action of nAChRs to improve treatments for
      smoking cessation and other problems affected by these receptors. These new study methods may
      involve different radiotracers, which are drugs that can help show brain activity during
      positron emission tomography (PET) scanning.

      Objectives:

      - To evaluate the feasibility of using a radiotracer, 2-[18F]F-A-85380, in PET scanning of
      the brain.

      Eligibility:

      - Healthy volunteers between 21 and 45 years of age who do not use tobacco.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be asked to avoid consuming alcohol or using a number of
           over-the-counter medications, including antihistamines, cough medicines, and nasal
           decongestants, for 5 days before the study day. Participants provide urine and breath
           samples at the start of the study to be tested for chemicals that may interfere with the
           study.

        -  Participants will visit the clinical center the morning of the day before the scanning
           session to provide blood and urine samples as required. Participants will return and be
           admitted for an overnight stay later that afternoon or evening.

        -  On the day of the study, participants will receive a single dose of the radiotracer

NCT01046617,Lactobacillus Reuteri for the Treatment of Infantile Colic:,"
      Infantile colic is characterized by excessive crying (defined as crying that last at least 3
      hours a day, for 3 days a week, for at least 3 weeks) in an otherwise healthy infant. The
      crying typically starts in the first few weeks of life and ends by 4-5 months of age. The
      condition is usually self-limited, with no long-term adverse effects; however, it may be very
      distressing to parents, hence, any safe and effective treatment would be desirable. Recently,
      it has been suggested that probiotics may offer some benefit.This is based on the results of
      one open randomized controlled trial. In this trial, 83 breast-fed infants with colic defined
      as >3 hours of crying on >3 days/week were randomly allocated to receive Lactobacillus
      reuteri DSM 17938 (108 colony-forming units, once daily 30 minutes after feeding) or
      simethicone (60 mg/day as 15 drops twice a day after feeding) for 28 days. Mothers followed a
      cow's milk free diet. By day 28 after randomization, mothers of infants in the probiotic
      group were significantly more likely than mothers of infants in the simethicone group to
      report a reduction from baseline in average crying time to less than 3 hours per day (95% vs.
      7%). In addition, median crying times were significantly shorter in the probiotic group than
      in the simethicone group. No adverse effects of L. reuteri were reported.

      Although the mechanism of action of L. reuteri for treating infantile colic has not been
      elucidated yet, the findings are very promising. However, there are some methodological
      limitations to the study, including no allocation concealment, no blinding, and no
      intention-to-treat analysis; these may result in selection, performance, and/or attrition
      biases and, eventually, invalidate the results. Another limitation of the study is the lack
      of a true placebo group. Given these consideration a new study is proposed that is aiming to

NCT01047293,"RAD001, FOLFOX and Bevacizumab in Treatment of Colorectal Carcinoma","
      RAD001 (everolimus) is a novel oral derivative of rapamycin. RAD001 has been in clinical
      development since 1996 as an immunosuppressant in solid organ transplantation and has
      obtained marketing authorization (Certican®) for prophylaxis of rejection in renal and
      cardiac transplantation in a number of countries, including the majority of the European
      Union. RAD001 has been in development for patients with various malignancies since 2002.

      RAD001 is being investigated as an anticancer agent based on its potential to act:

        -  Directly on the tumor cells by inhibiting tumor cell growth and proliferation

        -  Indirectly by inhibiting angiogenesis leading to reduced tumor vascularity (via potent
           inhibition of tumor cell HIF-1 activity, VEGF production and VEGF-induced proliferation
           of endothelial cells). The role of angiogenesis in the maintenance of solid tumor growth
           is well established, and the mTOR pathway has been implicated in the regulation of tumor
           production of proangiogenic factors as well as modulation of VEGFR signaling in
           endothelial cells.

      At weekly and daily schedules and at various doses explored, RAD001 is generally well
      tolerated. The most frequent adverse events (rash, mucositis, fatigue and headache)
      associated with RAD001 therapy are manageable. Non-infectious pneumonitis has been reported
      with mTOR inhibitors but is commonly low-grade and reversible.

      Both FOLFOX and bevacizumab are well established for treatment of metastatic colorectal
      carcinomas. FOLFOX-6 can be combined safely with Bevacizumab and is currently in phase 3
      testing for adjuvant therapy and is commonly used as a first line treatment regimen for
      metastatic colorectal cancers 25. There is an enhanced interest in development of more
      effective regimens for colorectal cancers. RAD001 is a mTOR inhibitor that has preclinical
      and clinical activity in colorectal cancers. RAD001 downregulates the mTOR pathway which can
      lead to direct antiproliferative effects as well as decreased production of Vascular
      Endothelial Growth Factor. A combination of RAD001 at 10 mg per day in combination with
      Bevacizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks has been shown to be efficacious and safe. In another
      trial, RAD001 was shown to have many patients with stable disease and clearly needs to be
      given in combination therapy.

NCT01047527,An Effectiveness Trial of Maintenance Therapy for Nicotine Dependence,"
      The transdermal nicotine patch is the most widely used form of tobacco dependence treatment
      in the US and Europe, but most smokers are unable to successfully quit with this form of
      treatment. Failure to respond to this treatment may, to a large extent, be due to the use of
      nicotine patches for only 8 weeks, the recommended treatment duration. We have found in a
      controlled randomized clinical trial that using the nicotine patch for 24 weeks can increase
      quit rates significantly. We propose here a clinical trial to replicate and extend these
      results to a community setting in the real-world, using the same research design utilized in
      clinical trials to demonstrate the effectiveness of methadone maintenance therapy for opiate
      dependence. Specifically, 540 smokers will receive counseling and standard (8-weeks),
      extended (24-weeks), or maintenance (52 weeks) therapy with transdermal nicotine patches. The
      main outcome is biochemically-verified smoking cessation at week 52. The cost-effectiveness,
      safety, and mechanism of effect (e.g., promotion of recovery following a lapse) for
      maintenance therapy with transdermal nicotine will also be assessed. The study results may
      change how we treat nicotine dependence with transdermal nicotine.

NCT01047670,Septic Shock em Steroids,"
      Septic shock is a frequent reason for admission on pediatric intensive care units.
      Interventions which can change morbidity and mortality of septic shock patients are of great
      interest. Steroid replacement in adults with severe sepsis and septic shock have been
      extensively studied. It was recently demonstrated that low dose steroid (< 300mg/ day) used
      for more than 5 days was associated with decreased mortality and lower requirement of
      vasoactive support in the adult population that had a low response to the ACTH test. However,
      this was not confirmed in the latest results from the CORTICUS study. Use of low dose
      hydrocortisone, or any other steroid has not been studied in critically ill children.
      Mortality associated with sepsis in children has decreased in the last decade and currently
      it is close to 10%, making it difficult to power a study able to show reduced mortality.
      Taking into account the results from previous studies reporting the high incidence of adrenal
      failure and its association to worse outcome, we have designed a clinical trial to evaluate
      the effect of low dose hydrocortisone in children with septic shock: Cortisol Replacement in

NCT01047813,The Effects of High and Low GI Breakfasts on Cognitive Performance in Adults With Type 2 Diabetes,"
      Consumption of a low glycemic index (GI) diet has been shown to improve glycaemic control in
      type 2 diabetics(Brand-Miller et al., 2003; Jenkins et al., 2008). In addition to the
      benefits for glycaemic control there is some evidence for acute improvements in cognitive
      performance after consumption of low GI foods compared with high GI foods in both adults
      (Benton et al., 2003; Kaplan et al., 2000) and adolescents (Ingwersen et al., 2007; Smith and
      Foster, 2008).

      Given these findings it is possible that low GI focused dietary interventions designed to
      improve glycaemic control and health outcomes for diabetic patients could also improve the
      cognitive function of these patients. This is of particular relevance in light of the
      evidence associating type 2 diabetes with cognitive decrements (Awad et al., 2004; Stewart
      and Loilitsa 1999; van Harten et al., 2006). To date two studies with type 2 diabetics have
      reported that a low GI breakfast was associated with increased verbal memory performance
      compared to a high GI breakfast (Greenwood et al., 2003; Papanikolaou et al. 2006). Further
      research should investigate the benefit of low GI foods to cognition.

      The aim of this study is to examine the effects of high and low glycaemic index breakfast on
      cognitive performance in adults with type 2 diabetes. Participants will perform a battery of
      cognitive tests after consuming 3 different breakfasts (high GI, low GI, and water) on 3
      different tests days. The participants will be recruited from the general public and from the
      Leeds Teaching Hospital diabetes clinic.

      This research can benefit the development of specific dietary behaviours aimed at reducing
      diabetes related cognitive decline. This research is part of a PhD funded by the Economic and

      Lutein is one of oxygenated carotenoids. Over the past few years, there has been increased

      epidemiological studies support the notion that the high intake dietary of lutein is strongly
      associated with a decreased relative risk of AMD.Moreover, findings from initial
      observational studies have now been followed by placebo-controlled intervention trials

      The purpose of this study is to better understand the anti-inflammatory benefits of two
      prescription medicines that are currently used to help people with cholesterol problems.

      Fish oil, from eating certain kinds of fish and from supplement pills, has been used to help
      control cholesterol and reduce inflammation (the body's response to injury or sickness).
      Lovaza® is the brand name for prescription strength fish oil pills. In this study, we will be
      looking at how Lovaza® works to help reduce inflammation in healthy volunteers.

      Tricor® is the brand name for prescription fenofibrate pills. Fenofibrate is a prescription
      medicine that many doctors give to people with high triglyceride (fat in the blood) levels.
      In this study, we will be looking at how Tricor® works to help reduce inflammation in healthy
      volunteers.

      Endotoxin or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a small part of bacteria (that is no longer living)
      that can cause many of the effects similar to bacterial infections in humans. However, it can
      be administered in very small amounts to produce a mild immune response much the same as a
      'flu' like illness. Within 1 ½ -3 hours after giving LPS by vein, a response consisting of
      fever, chills, headache, nausea and vomiting and generalized aches and pains will occur which
      lasts up to 6-8 hours. In addition to the flu like symptoms, the response causes temporary
      changes in cholesterol, triglycerides and blood sugar. Different people respond differently
      to LPS. We are using LPS in this study to bring on a temporary inflammatory response in the
      body and to compare the responses of people who receive Lovaza® or Tricor® to the responses
      of people who receive a placebo (pill that does not contain medicine).

NCT01048957,The Neural Basis of Cue-Elicited Cigarette Craving and Its Control,"
      Background:

      - One kind of drug craving, known as cue-elicited craving, occurs when a drug user who sees a
      drug-related cue (such as an image of someone using the drug) begins to feel a craving for
      the drug. Researchers are interested in studying how cue-elicited craving affects brain
      activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG)
      data.

      Objectives:

      - To determine which parts of the brain are associated with or involved in controlling
      cue-related craving in smokers.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals between 18 and 50 years of age who are current smokers (10 or more cigarettes
      per day) and agree to try to abstain from smoking for 1 week during the experiment.

      Design:

        -  Participants will visit a clinical center for up to four scanning sessions, and will be
           asked to perform two or three outpatient tasks at home over the course of the study.

        -  Scan 1: Training session with a mock fMRI scanner, followed by an actual fMRI scanning
           session and EEG in which participants respond to pictures.

        -  Outpatient Task 1: Tolerance test with nicotine patch (worn for 8 hours, followed by 12
           additional hours without cigarette use).

        -  Scans 2 and 3: Training session and fMRI scan and testing with either nicotine patch or
           placebo. Tasks in fMRI involve looking at cues, reporting craving and suppressing
           craving.

        -  Outpatient Task 2: Participants will keep an electronic diary for 10 to 14 days,
           responding to questions as directed by the researchers.

        -  Scans 4 and 5: Training session, fMRI scan and EEG, and testing in which participants
           will be instructed on methods to attempt to control cravings.

        -  Outpatient Task 3: Participants will keep an electronic diary for 14 days. For the first

NCT01049009,The Effect of Nebivolol on Endothelial Dysfunction in African Americans With Hypertension,"
      High blood pressure (hypertension) is called the ""silent killer"" because many people do not
      know they have it, and do not know when it is well controlled. Unfortunately, over time
      uncontrolled hypertension can cause irreversible organ damage that can lead to heart attack,
      stroke, heart failure, and kidney failure. If a person cannot control their blood pressure
      with diet and exercise, doctors often prescribe medications to help control the blood
      pressure. Nebivolol is a medication that has been recently approved by the FDA for the
      treatment of hypertension. Our study will investigate whether treatment with nebivolol, as
      compared to another medication called metoprolol, in African Americans with hypertension will
      be more effective in protecting blood vessels against the harmful effects of high blood
      pressure.

      Over time high blood pressure causes hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis) which leads
      to narrowing of the blood vessels and reduces blood flow to our organs. Arteries also relax
      and contract naturally, which further changes the blood supply. When arteries are narrowed,
      exercise can bring on a condition in which the blood supply is inadequate, and this might
      result in the sensation of pain.

      Cells lining our blood vessels produce a variety of substances that normally cause arteries
      to relax. Two of these substances are called nitric oxide (NO) and endothelium-derived
      hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF). We are trying to determine the nature of these substances in
      African Americans with high blood pressure and how it is affected by nebivolol and
      metoprolol. One way to determine this is to inject drugs such as L-NMMA
      (N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine) or TEA (tetraethylammonium chloride), which block the production
      of NO and EDHF respectively, and then study what happens to the blood flow at rest and during
      exercise. It is our thought that nebivolol, in comparison to metoprolol, will increase the
      substances that naturally cause arteries to relax and improve blood supply.

NCT01049048,The Effect of Vitamin D Statues on Endothelial Function,"
      In the United States, cardiovascular disease causes over one-third of all deaths and vitamin
      D deficiency is an epidemic. An increasing body of data suggests that low vitamin D status
      adversely impacts the cardiovascular system. It is our fundamental hypothesis that vitamin D
      deficiency is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease by causing endothelial dysfunction.
      Moreover, we hypothesize that vitamin D supplementation will restore endothelial function,
      thereby reducing cardiovascular disease risk.

      This pilot research will be conducted in 64 post-menopausal women participating in an
      existing study of vitamin D supplementation (32 will receive vitamin D3 2,500 IU daily, the
      others matching placebo) and will explore the effects of vitamin D on endothelial function
      and arterial reactivity. Post-menopausal women aged 55-65 years are chosen due to their
      highest risk for development of a subsequent new cardiovascular disease diagnosis. All study
      participants will have fasting laboratory and noninvasive vascular ultrasound studies
      performed at baseline and four months later. The primary outcome measure of this pilot study
      is change in markers of endothelial function and arterial stiffness with vitamin D3 therapy.
      If our hypotheses are correct, our long-term goals include investigation of the effect of
      vitamin D repletion on subclinical atherosclerosis and subsequent cardiovascular events.

NCT01042327,Study to Assess Clearances and Bio-compatibility of ELISIO Dialyzer,"
      Today, haemodialysis is a recognized standard treatment for patients with chronic kidney
      disease stage 5. During the haemodialysis treatment session, blood passes from the patient
      through the extracorporeal circuit and is then returned. The dialyzer represents the greatest
      surface are of the extracorporeal circuit, as dialysis treatment is essentially based on the
      removal of small molecular weight solutes down along a concentration gradient, and this
      depends upon surface area. The ELISIO-H dialyzer differs in design to our current standard
      dialyzer, the FX100, by having fibers of a greater internal diameter, which potentially
      allows more internal haemofiltration, leading to an improved clearance of larger molecular
      weight solutes. It is now thought that these so called ""middle molecular weight"" solutes are
      more important in contributing to the clinical condition termed azotaemia, rather than
      smaller solutes such as urea.

      The investigators therefore wish to study the clearance of middle sized molecules between the
      different dialyzers.

NCT01041924,Dynamic Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Administration for Sleep Apnoea,"
      Normally breathing is controlled by a reflex that responds to the levels of carbon dioxide
      (CO2) in the blood. In heart failure, where the heart muscle is damaged and therefore does
      not pump as well, this reflex is exaggerated. The result is a vicious circle: blood CO2
      levels fluctuate wildly and as a result breathing also fluctuates with patients
      hyperventilating at times and briefly stopping breathing at others. During sleep this is
      called central sleep apnoea (CSA).

      Patients with CSA wake up throughout the night and whilst some patients are oblivious to
      this, others are consciously breathless and many patients are tired during the day and feel
      unable to perform their daily activities.

      As part of the body's stress response to the erratic pattern of breathing, both blood
      pressure and heart rate may rise to a level that is harmful in a failing heart, exacerbating
      the underlying heart failure. Indeed patients who demonstrate this CSA die sooner than those
      who have heart failure and stable breathing.

      There are no proven specific therapies for CSA that stabilise breathing, improve sleep
      quality, and prolong life. We have designed a system which delivers very small doses of CO2,
      when the blood level of CO2 is predicted to be low. During short daytime recordings, using
      this system, we have demonstrated that it is possible to stabilise the body's CO2 levels.

      We aim to test what happens when CO2 is given overnight whilst the patient is sleeping to see
      whether we can stabilise their breathing over longer durations and whether sleep quality
      could be improved so that patients are less tired during the day. In addition, we would like
      to measure whether the stress response is lessened if the breathing is successfully
      stabilised.

      Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is a common disease that affects many Americans, and
      can lead to devastating consequences such as heart attack, stroke, and death if not treated.
      Nebivolol is a medication that has been recently approved by the FDA for the treatment of
      hypertension. Nebivolol has an unusual profile compared to other medications, in that its
      effects may be related to release of a substance called nitric oxide. Nitric oxide is
      released from the cells lining the blood vessels, and nebivolol may stimulate these cells to
      release more nitric oxide. Our study will investigate whether treatment with nebivolol, as
      compared to another medication called metoprolol, in hypertensive subjects will be more
      effective in protecting blood vessels against the harmful effects of high blood pressure. The
      mechanisms we will investigate include oxidative stress markers and circulating levels of

      In this study, newborn babies with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), receiving oxygen via
      nasal CPAP, and needing surfactant treatment will be randomized to standard delivery of
      surfactant via and endotracheal tube airway(inserted after pre-medication for pain), or to
      surfactant delivery via laryngeal mask airway (LMA). The intent is to remove the airways and
      return babies to nasal CPAP, after surfactant is given. The primary outcome measure is the
      rate of failure of initial surfactant therapy. Standardized failure criteria are reached: a)
      early, if the baby is unable to be placed back on CPAP (needs mechanical ventilation) or, b)
      late, if the baby requires retreatment with surfactant within 8 hours or more than 2 doses of
      surfactant.

      The objective of this protocol is to reduce the need for endotracheal intubation and
      mechanical ventilation in preterm neonates with RDS needing rescue surfactant therapy by
      instilling surfactant though an LMA, while achieving comparable efficacy of surfactant
      treatment.

      The hypothesis is that surfactant treatment through an LMA will decrease the proportion of
      babies with RDS who require mechanical ventilation or subsequent intubation, when compared
      with standard surfactant treatment following sedation and endotracheal intubation.

NCT01044771,Pilot Study of Raltegravir Switch to Resolve Tenofovir Induced Proteinuria,"
      The study is designed to evaluate the proportion of patients with tenofovir induced
      proteinuria that will resolve their proteinuria when the tenofovir containing
      nucleoside/nucleotide backbone is switched to a raltegravir backbone. Common HIV treatment
      regimens contain nucleoside/nucleotide combinations that may have long-term side effects
      including nephrotoxicity. Switching these backbones out for an integrase inhibitor based
      regimen has not been systematically evaluated.

      Hypothesis: Proteinuria developing during treatment with tenofovir improves or resolves when
      tenofovir is switched out with raltegravir. Switching to a nuc- sparing regimen, containing
      raltegravir and a boosted protease inhibitor in patients without preexisting protease
      inhibitor mutations is safe and does not lead to virologic failure

      Cisplatin is one of the most emetogenic drugs used in clinical practice and it could result
      in poor compliance with chemotherapy. The 5-HT3 receptor antagonists prevent vomiting in
      acute phase emesis after chemotherapy in 73 - 92% of cisplatin-treated patients when
      coadministered with steroids, but they appear to lack efficacy in the delayed phase emesis.
      Ramosetron, a new 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, has been shown to have equivalent efficacy and
      tolerability and a longer duration of effect than granisetron in preventing acute vomiting in
      patients undergoing cisplatin-containing chemotherapy. Acute phase emesis was prevented in
      84.8% of patients receiving ramosetron plus dexamethasone, but the CR rate of total phase
      emesis was less than 60%.

      Aprepitant is a selective, high-affinity NK1 receptor antagonist. Adding aprepitant to 5-HT3
      receptor antagonists and steroid improve CR rate of not only chemotherapy induced acute
      emesis and but also delayed emesis by 11-14 and 20 percentage points, respectively.

      A single center, open label randomized clinical trial designed to examine ovarian follicular
      dynamics following attempted atresia induction during the late follicular and early luteal
      phase of the menstrual cycle using an aromatase inhibitor.

      We hypothesize that administration of an aromatase inhibitor (AI) at biologically important
      times of the natural menstrual cycle will cause ovulatory failure in women with preovulatory
      follicles and failure of luteogenesis in women who have recently ovulated. It is proposed
      that atresia of the dominant follicle and formation of anovulatory structures will be
      associated with arrested endometrial development and a shortened interval to menstrual
      bleeding (3 days). We anticipate that this will provide us with information to facilitate the
      development of a new method for emergency contraception and a greater understanding of human
      folliculogenesis.

      The rationale for the proposed research project is based on the ovarian synchronization
      concepts developed and documented in the bovine model in the Reproductive Science and
      Medicine Research group at the University of Saskatchewan combined with novel human ovarian
      wave concepts of folliculogenesis first elucidated in the Women's Health Imaging Research

NCT01047449,Improving the Results of Heart Bypass Surgery Using New Approaches to Surgery and Medication,"
      Surgery for blocked arteries in the heart (coronary artery bypass grafting) can be
      accomplished using veins from the leg sewn onto the heart to provide an alternate path for
      blood flow, i.e. 'bypassing' the blockages. These veins themselves can block over time. This
      may result in part simply from the trauma from the surgery, in other words, by removing the
      vein from the leg and then sewing it to the heart. Another mechanism may be the abnormal
      metabolic processes within the body responsible for the plaque build-up of the heart arteries
      in the first place - this may lead to the blockages of the veins used for bypass. In the
      present era of heart bypass surgery, this incidence of veins blocking remains high despite
      advances in blood thinners and cholesterol medications. This study is designed to determine
      whether two new interventions may potentially reduce the incidence of blockages in the veins
      used for heart bypass surgery. One is a surgical technique significantly reducing the trauma
      associated with removing the leg vein prior to use as a bypass graft onto the heart. The
      second intervention is the use of a nutritional supplement before and after surgery which is
      composed of fish oils. The study will recruit sufficient patients to provide strong and
      relevant conclusions regarding both study questions. It will be highly applicable also
      because it will include approximately 1,550 patients from approximately 50 hospitals across
      many countries. We believe these techniques will result in significantly less vein blockages
      in patients one year after heart bypass surgery.

      This research study is being performed to begin to determine the effectiveness of two
      dominant bariatric surgery procedures versus an intensive lifestyle intervention to induce
      weight loss in patients and promote improvements in Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in
      moderately obese patients.

      T2DM is currently the 6th leading cause of mortality in the United States and is a major
      cause of kidney failure, blindness, amputations, heart attack, and other vascular and
      gastro-intestinal dysfunctions. Traditionally, treatments include intensive lifestyle
      modifications with or without glucose lowering agents. Neither treatment alone, or in
      combination, results in complete resolution of diabetes and its potential long-term
      complications. Bariatric surgery has been proven as an effective treatment to accomplish
      sustained and significant weight loss for those with severe obesity and has been shown to
      induce long-term remission of T2DM. However, despite enthusiasm for these potential treatment
      options, it is not clear whether diabetes is influenced by the type of surgery or by the
      amount of weight lost or if bariatric surgery is more effective than non-surgical weight loss
      induced by diet and physical activity in T2DM patients with moderate BMIs (30-40kg/m2; Class
      I and Class II obesity, or approximately 65-95 pounds overweight depending on your height).
      More well-controlled studies are needed to more completely inform health care decision making
      and clinical practice in this area. This research study aims to obtain preliminary
      information regarding the effectiveness of two major types of bariatric surgery, Laparoscopic
      Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass and Laparoscopic Adjustable Gastric Banding versus an intensive
      lifestyle intervention to induce weight loss with diet and increased physical activity.

NCT01047774,The Effect of Soy Protein on Post- Breast Cancer Surgery Pain,"
      The incidence of chronic pain after breast cancer surgery (CPBCS) is high in women diagnosed
      with breast cancer. Similar to other chronic postoperative pain conditions, existing
      treatments for CPBCS do not always work. Adopting the concept of using pain relieving
      measures prior to surgery rather than after it, may lead to decreased postoperative pain
      levels. Soy has been shown to have pain-relieving properties and may reduce the risk for
      developing chronic post-surgical pain. The purpose of this study is to determine the effects
      of adding soy protein to the diet before surgery on the development of chronic pain.

      The goal of our research is to increase live birth rates in infertile women and to reduce the
      incidence of aneuploidy leading to miscarriage and trisomies. We hypothesize that an age
      related mitochondrial dysfunction reduces the availability of energy in the oocyte and
      contributes to abnormal segregation of chromosomes during the meiotic division leading to
      oocyte aneuploidy. Based on preliminary evidence we have obtained in aged mice, we propose
      that dietary supplementation with Co enzyme Q10 in older women will improve mitochondrial
      function in the oocytes, leading to a decrease in chromosomal non-disjunction and resulting
      in embryos with a normal chromosomal complement. Our primary outcome measure will be
      determination of oocyte chromosome number by multiplex PCR based assay of polar bodies
      biopsied at the time of IVF. Outcomes of this proposal will enable us to address the
      mechanisms of ovarian aging and may explain etiology of decreased fertility in older
      patients. In addition, our work will add to the feasibility of single embryo transfer,
      thereby avoiding multiple pregnancies and their associated cost to the health care system and

NCT01048554,Temozolomide Plus Bevacizumab in Patients With Metastatic Melanoma Involving the Central Nervous System,"
      This research is being done because melanoma in the brain is very difficult to treat because
      it does not respond to radiation or to chemotherapy, such as temozolomide. One of the reasons
      for this is that the melanoma can make chemicals that signal the brain to provide new blood
      vessels for the tumor. The main signal is called VEGF. Bevacizumab is an antibody that blocks
      VEGF. The investigators want to see if the combination of bevacizumab and temozolomide will

NCT01049776,GW786034 in Patients With Non Small Cell Lung Cancer 3rd Line,"
      Lung Cancer is the most common cause of cancer death in the United States with an estimated
      mortality in excess of 160,000, more than the combined mortality seen with prostate, breast,
      colorectal cancers(1). Most patients with Lung Cancer have Non-Small Cell Lung Cancers(
      NSCLC) and only 25-30% of patients with NSCLC (Non Small Cell Lung Cancer) have resectable
      disease( Stage I or II) at the time of diagnosis.

      The vast majority of patients with advanced NSCLC (Non Small Cell Lung Cancer) are not
      curable and overall five year survival is 11%-14%1.

      Chemotherapy is beneficial for patients with locally advanced and metastatic disease.
      Numerous phase III studies have determined the superiority of systemic chemotherapy over best
      supportive care. Platinum based chemotherapy has been widely accepted as the standard of care
      for the initial treatment of advanced NSCLC.

      However first line chemotherapy is modest at best. A randomized trial comparing four of the
      most commonly used chemotherapy regimens in the United States not only failed to show a
      clearly superior arm but also confirmed the dismal prognosis of these patients. The response
      rate for all 1207 patients was 18.6% with a median survival of eight months and one year
      survival of 33.5 % and a two year survival of 12%5. Clearly a different paradigm is needed

NCT01045031,Cognitive Function in Elderly Marathon Runners,"
      There is substantial research on the effects of physical exercise on cognitive functions.
      However, less attention has been paid on the requirements of training intensity and length to
      enhance cognitive abilities in the elderly. To the investigators knowledge no studies have
      evaluated the effects of extensive endurance exercise training on cognitive functions by
      studying elderly marathon runners and bicyclists. On the basis of the scientific literature
      published so far it is not known whether the beneficial impact of endurance exercise training
      depends on the intensity of training.

NCT01045122,Sedation in Patients at Risk for Upper Airway Collapse,"
      Overview of Protocol:

      Between Subject - Repeated Measures design will be used to assess the airway response of two
      groups of subjects under two different sedated conditions. Each group will be comprised of
      six subjects and will be categorized according to their baseline profile for risk for SDB (<
      10 RDI or > 25 RDI). Some subjects will have been prescribed continuous positive airway
      pressure (CPAP) therapy by their treating physician as a result of their overnight sleep
      study. CPAP treatment is effective in splinting the airway open and thus decreasing the
      incident of airway collapse during sleep. Thus, CPAP utilization will also be tracked as an
      independent and continuous variable as regular CPAP use has been found to be associated with
      increased resistance to UAC (upper airway collapse).

      The experimental conditions will evaluate upper airway patency and instability in response to
      two forms of intravenous sedation: propofol and dexmedetomidine.

      Subjects will be continuously monitored during each experimental condition for respiratory
      effort and flow, and for EEG, EMG, and ECG.

      Respiratory instability will first be assessed while subjects are under sedation without any
      airway provocation. The degree of respiratory instability will be quantified in terms of the
      following measurements: a modified Respiratory Disturbance Index (RDIsedated), respiratory
      arousals, and minute ventilation. The apneic periods will be classified by their mixture of
      central and obstructive components.All outcome measurements are assessed over the period of
      sedation which last for approximately one hour.

      Upper airway patency will be quantified in terms of the critical pharyngeal pressure (Pcrit)
      (the pressure beyond which complete upper airway collapse occurs, see background).

      Phase 1 of this study will evaluate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of XL147 when given in
      combination with trastuzumab (Herceptin) and in combination with trastuzumab and paclitaxel.
      After the MTD is established for each combination (Phase 2), subjects will be enrolled to
      evaluate the preliminary efficacy and safety of these combinations in metastatic HER2
      positive breast cancer. Both trastuzumab and paclitaxel are used in the treatment of
      metastatic breast cancer (MBC), but patients can develop resistance.

      The link between PI3K mutations and trastuzumab resistance has been seen in breast cancer
      patients. This suggests that inhibitors of the PI3K/PTEN pathway may have the potential to
      restore sensitivity to trastuzumab. Similarly, introduction of activated mutant forms of PI3K
      has been shown to transform and confer paclitaxel resistance to immortalized breast
      epithelial cells. XL147 is a potent and selective inhibitor of PI3K and inhibits
      phosphorylation of multiple downstream components of PI3K/PTEN signaling. Therefore, XL147
      may have utility in the treatment of trastuzumab resistant/refractory and HER2-positive MBC
      when administered in combination with trastuzumab alone or with trastuzumab and paclitaxel.

NCT01046175,Effect of Air-stacking on Peak Cough Flow in Patients With Acute Cervical or High Thoracic Spinal Cord Injury,"
      Respiratory complications continue to be one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality
      in people with spinal cord injury, especially among cervical and higher thoracic injuries.
      Both inspiratory and expiratory function are often severely decreased, leading to respiratory
      complications, such as atelectasis, pneumonia and ventilatory failure. The prevention of
      these respiratory complications needs to begin immediately after injury. To achieve effective
      expelling of secretions before they form mucus plugs, it is essential to improve patients
      ability to cough. Manually assisting the cough is one way of increasing cough flow, but an
      effective cough also requires adequate lung volumes. The emphasis should therefore be on
      expansion of the lungs before coughing. One way of expanding the lungs is by air-stacking. In
      air-stacking insufflations are stacked in the lungs to maximally expand them. Cough can be
      valued by measuring Peak Cough Flow (PCF). By combining air-stacking with manually assisted
      cough the PCF can be increased sufficiently. The aim of this study is to compare the effect
      of two different air-stacking techniques on PCF, air-stacking on a respirator versus
      air-stacking with a manual resuscitator.

NCT01046981,Tumescent Antibiotic Delivery Pharmacokinetics,"
      Tumescent Antibiotic Delivery (TAD) is a technique for improving the prevention of surgical
      site infections (SSI). TAD involves the subcutaneous infiltration of tumescent local
      anesthesia (TLA) containing water soluble antibiotic(s) such as cefazolin and metronidazole.
      TLA consists of the subcutaneous infiltration of very dilute lidocaine (≤ 1 gram/liter) and
      epinephrine (≤ 1 milligram/liter) with sodium bicarbonate (10 milliequivalents/liter) in a
      physiologic solution of sodium chloride which produces intense local anesthesia associated
      with profound wide-spread vasoconstriction lasting for more than 12 hours. Compared to
      intravenous antibiotic delivery (IVAD), TAD is expected to produce higher local tissue
      concentrations of the antibiotic(s) for longer periods of time and lower systemic/serum
      antibiotic concentrations. This clinical trial will compare TAD to IVAD with respect to
      pharmacokinetic evidence for possible improved SSI prevention.

NCT01042873,The Hemodynamic Response to Prolonged Dobutamine Infusion,"
      A decrease in the response of beta 1 adrenergic receptors to agonists (desensitization) is
      thought to play a major role in the pathogenesis of diseases such as congestive heart

      desensitization of the hemodynamic responses to beta 1 adrenergic receptors in vivo.

      Our hypothesis is that constant 3 hours intravenous infusion of the selective beta1
      adrenergic receptor agonist dobutamine will result in gradual decline in hemodynamic

NCT01040260,Low-Cost Contingency Management for Smoking Cessation,"
      An innovative low-cost form of contingency management has been developed in which
      participants receive the chance to draw vouchers from a fish bowl depending on whether or not
      their abstinence from tobacco is confirmed by expired-air carbon monoxide. The vouchers can
      be redeemed for prizes of varying value. This form of contingency management has been shown
      to be effective in the treatment of a variety of substance use disorders, but has not been
      investigated in a clinical trial focusing on smoking cessation. Thus, the primary purpose of
      the proposed study will be to investigate the effects of a low-cost prize-based form of
      contingency management in the treatment of nicotine dependence. To accomplish this objective,
      we enrolled 103 current smokers into the study. The participants in Study Arm 1 received the
      contingency management intervention for 8 weeks, and the participants in Study Arm 2 had
      their smoking status assessed but did not receive the contingency management intervention.
      Both interventions received brief counseling and nicotine replacement therapy. The counseling
      was conducted in two 60-minute individual sessions scheduled one week apart with two
      follow-up phone calls at weeks 3, 4, and 6.

      The primary outcome for this study was biochemically-validated smoking status at 3 months
      (end of treatment), and at 6- and 12-month follow-up. Both continuous and point-prevalent
      abstinence rates were determined. Saliva cotinine levels were measured in all participants
      reporting abstinence at each assessment. This study had 80% power to detect a 10% absolute
      difference in smoking cessation rates between the two treatment conditions (i.e., a 28% quit
      rate in Study Arm 1 versus a 18% quit rate in Study Arm 2) with alpha set at 0.05. These
      estimates included an anticipated 15% loss to follow-up over the 12-month study period.

NCT01046604,Pilot Study of Lovaza (Omega 3 Fatty Acids) to Improve Cardiac Antioxidant/Anti-inflammatory Profile Before Cardiac Surgery,"
      In the absence of treatment, severe mitral valve regurgitation (MR) results in left atrium
      (LA) dilatation and hypertrophy, followed ultimately by left ventricular dysfunction and
      heart failure. One promising intervention for the prevention of the deleterious effects of
      pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure is dietary supplementation
      with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). However, the molecular targets and mechanisms
      by which n-3 PUFAs exert their effects are not completely defined. A possible target of n-3
      PUFAs is the mitochondrial membrane which has broad implications given that mitochondrial
      dysfunction and altered metabolism have been associated with cardiac hypertrophy and heart
      failure. The investigators have recently identified significant mitochondrial dysfunction in
      the LA of patients with severe MR, as compared to their non-hypertrophied right atrium (RA).
      However, the investigators have not addressed the possibility that intervention with purified
      n-3 PUFAs (Lovaza) could improve mitochondrial function. From a mechanistic perspective, the
      investigators have observed in vitro that n-3 PUFAs accumulate predominately into the
      mitochondrial membrane of cardiomyocytes where the investigators believe they exert their
      effects on the biophysical organization of the membrane. Therefore, the CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS is
      that administering Lovaza to patients with severe MR will reduce apoptosis and improve
      mitochondrial function in LA (Aim 1). This change in mitochondrial function will be driven by
      significant biochemical and biophysical remodeling of the mitochondrial membrane (Aim 2).

NCT01047163,Maintenance of Muscle Mass in Older People: the Negative Impact of Statin Therapy,"
      A major contributor to frailty and immobility in the elderly is the age related loss of
      muscle mass (sarcopenia). Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality in
      the elderly, with high blood cholesterol and lipids being the major modifiable risk factor.
      Statins reduce blood cholesterol, but muscle related pain, tenderness and discomfort
      (myopathy) is an adverse event associated with statin therapy, with older people being at a
      much greater risk. Statin myopathy presents as muscle aches and weakness, with or without
      evidence of muscle damage; however the underlying mechanisms responsible for these symptoms
      are poorly understood. Using an animal model, the applicants have shown the main pathway
      regulating muscle protein synthesis is inhibited in statin myopathy, and genes regulating
      muscle protein breakdown, the inhibition of muscle carbohydrate use and inflammation are
      dramatically increased. Therefore we wish to determine whether these changes are seen in the
      muscle of older people with symptoms of statin myopathy, and whether this is associated with
      lower muscle mass and impaired muscle function compared with older people with no history of
      statin use. Identification of the mechanisms involved in statin myopathy could lead to
      effective therapy for older people unable to tolerate statins.

      Pain is a common element of surgery. Opiates (morphine, oxycodone, hydrocodone, methadone,
      fentanyl) are very helpful in decreasing pain after surgery. Unfortunately, with repeated use
      opiates lose their effectiveness, such that patients need to utilize more opiates to achieve
      adequate pain relief - a phenomenon called tolerance. Sometimes tolerance to a pain
      reliever's effects can develop in just a few hours. It is thought that activation of the
      N-methyl d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, a ""switch"" found on the surface of nerves, is partially
      responsible for opiate tolerance. Memantine is a medication that limits the activity of NMDA
      receptors in the brain and spinal cord. It has been used for years to help patients with

NCT01043939,Purple Grape Juice in Improving Vascular Health in Childhood Cancer Survivors,"
      Rationale: Survivors of childhood cancer are at an increased risk of developing
      cardiovascular risk factors as well as early cardiovascular disease, likely due to the
      intensive therapeutic regimen used to treat their cancer. Purple grape juice (PGJ) is a rich
      source of flavonoids and a powerful antioxidant. Clinical studies in both diseased and
      healthy adults suggest that daily consumption of PGJ contributes to increased antioxidant
      capacity, reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation, and improved vasodilation.

      Purpose: This randomized clinical trial is evaluating whether purple grape juice can reduce
      oxidative stress and improve the vascular health of survivors of childhood cancer in the
      early stages of cardiovascular disease.

NCT01046370,"A Pilot Study of Amygdala Retraining Program in Patients With Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Chronic Fatigue and Fibromyalgia","
      The purpose of this pilot study is to gather preliminary data on the efficacy and feasibility
      of the Amygdala Retraining Program (ARP), a mind-body practice versus a control (C) on
      fatigue, quality of life and sleep in patients with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS), Chronic
      Fatigue (CF) and Fibromyalgia (FM).

      CFS, CF and FM are incapacitating disorders characterized by profound fatigue, muscle pain,
      impaired memory, insomnia, and post-exertional malaise (Fukuda 1994). Current literature
      points to a centrally sensitized state in CFS, CF and FM (Meeus 2007). The ARP attempts to
      retrain this neuronal network through mind-body practices such as cognitive restructuring via
      neurolinguistic programming, yoga based breathing and simple mindfulness based meditation. A
      case series of 33 patients with CFS and ARP reported improvement in 92% of patients with
      two-thirds of patients reaching 80-100% of pre-illness levels of health (Gupta 2009). However
      ARP has never been formally studied in CFS.

      We propose to gather preliminary data on the efficacy and feasibility of ARP versus C on
      fatigue, quality of life and sleep in 30 patients with CFS, CF and FM. All participants will
      undergo standard clinical treatment which consist of a 2 day self-management program in the
      Chronic Fatigue Clinic. Following this, participants will be randomized into the ARP or C
      group. The ARP group will receive an additional 2.5 hour training surrounding core concepts
      of the ARP program. They will then be given the ARP DVD program and booklet, to reinforce and
      continue the practice. They will then receive scheduled bi-monthly phone calls for 3 months
      from a study investigator for support. The C group will receive only standard care. However
      they will receive a complementary copy of the ARP program at the end of the study (6 month
      time point) as a gift for participation in the study.

      Preliminary data on efficacy will be assessed at baseline, 1, 3 and 6 months using the
      following validated questionnaires: Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MDFI), Short form-36
      (SF36) Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ), Epworth Sleep Scale (ESS) and Measure Your
      Medical Outcome Profile (MYMOP-2). Feasibility will be assessed by evaluation of a daily
      practice log where patients record the total time spent daily in the practice of ARP and any
      specific difficulties they encountered in the practice of the program.

NCT01044160,"Stress, Adjustment And Growth In Children With Cancer And Their Parents","
      This proposal examines trauma and growth responses in the childhood cancer experience. It
      addresses a number of gaps and unanswered questions in the literature, while integrating
      several distinct but related lines of research. The rationale for this proposal is outlined
      briefly as follows:

        1. Traumatic stress models focused on pathology dominate pediatric psychosocial oncology
           research despite empiric evidence of low levels of post-traumatic stress in this
           population.

        2. The assumption of 'cancer as a traumatic event' has biased research designs (including
           lack of control comparisons) to focus on deficits and pathological outcomes.

        3. This deficit-oriented approach has stimulated the development of interventions to treat
           or prevent PTSD, which may be unnecessary or even harmful.

        4. Theoretical and empiric evidence suggests that a more common response to traumatic
           stress is growth and positive change, but posttraumatic growth phenomenon have been
           understudied in pediatric populations.

        5. Cognitive and personality factors are important determinants of PTSD and positive growth
           outcomes, and some constructs from positive psychology theory may be particularly
           relevant in children with cancer.

        6. Empirically, parents of children with cancer appear to be at higher risk of PTSD/PTSS,
           although results are not unequivocal, and the same research biases have applied to
           parental outcomes. This proposal includes assessment of parental PTSS and PTG, both as
           an outcome and a predictor of child outcomes.

      associated with insulin sensitivity and vascular functioning, independent of adiposity, 2)
      lower insulin sensitivity and vascular functioning in AA relative to EA is due to lower

NCT01048606,Exercise and Phytoestrogens: Effect on Factors Predisposing to Cardiovascular Disease(CVD) in Postmenopausal Women,"
      Menopause is characterized by a decrease of estrogen and progesterone levels and is
      associated with various changes in body composition, including an accumulation of total fat
      mass, a relocation of adiposity to the abdomen, deterioration of plasma lipid profile,
      increased risk of type 2 diabetes, and increased oxidative stress. Taken together, these
      changes increase the risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD).

      Physical activity and hormone-replacement therapy (HRT) have been shown to act in synergy to
      improve total fat mass in postmenopausal (PM) women. Because the progesterone component of
      HRT has been associated with an increased CVD risk in older women with a family history of
      CVD, the use of HRT has become controversial. As a result, a large decrease of the use of HRT
      in the community has been observed and postmenopausal women (PM) have developed interest in
      alternative therapies. Among the possibilities, phytoestrogens have shown beneficial effects
      on menopausal symptoms and plasma lipids. Phytoestrogens are structurally and functionally
      similar to estradiol (the major estrogen in humans) but found only in plants such as soybean
      isoflavones. They do not exert any effect on breast cancer or/and endometrial tissue.

      AIMS To examine the effects of phytoestrogens, exercise and the combination of both on lean
      body mass, total fat mass, visceral fat, blood lipid profile, oxidative stress markers,
      antioxidant system, glucose metabolism, and sex-hormone levels in obese PM women.

      HYPOTHESES Women undergoing a combination of phytoestrogen treatment and an exercise program
      will display a greater increase in lean body mass, decrease in total and visceral fat mass,
      improvements in blood lipid profile, decrease in oxidative stress markers, increase in
      antioxidant system, improvement in glucose metabolism, and increase in sex-hormone levels
      than those submitted to any or one of the treatments.

      A total of 120 women will be recruited. There will be 4 groups (30 women/group) undergoing
      exercise or not and supplemented with phytoestrogens or a placebo. The intervention is
      planned to last 12 mo. Key variables will be measured at baseline, and after 6 and 12 mo of
      intervention.

      Three weekly 1h-sessions of exercise will be held on 3 non-consecutive days. The
      phytoestrogen supplements will consist of 70 mg/d of soy isoflavones taken as 4 caps/day.

      Busulfan and etoposide have been used as preparative therapy for autoSCT (stem cell
      transplant) in adults with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) at UCSF for the past 10 years. Over
      this period and together with collaborative transplant centers, over 200 patients have
      received this treatment. By intent-to-treat analysis, and with median follow-up of 7.0 years,
      the 5-year DFS is 55%. The current protocol will utilize the combination of IV Busulfan (BU)
      and etoposide. The busulfan dose will be escalated amongst 3 targeted dose levels. All
      targeted dose levels represent higher busulfan dosing than standard myeloablative dosing,
      with the lowest dose being approximately 14% higher than standard. Busulfan levels will be
      monitored after the first, fourth and twelfth doses. Dose adjustments will be made ""in real
      time"" based on AUC levels determined from the first and fourth doses. This strategy of
      busulfan monitoring and dose adjustment has improved the therapeutic widow of BU in previous
      clinical trials.

      The current protocol will utilize the combination of intravenous busulfan and etoposide. The
      busulfan dose will be escalated amongst 3 targeted dose levels (area under the curve (AUC)
      levels at time 6 hours of 1250 uMol*min, 1400 uMol*min and 1550 uMol*min). All targeted dose
      levels represent higher busulfan dosing than standard myeloablative dosing with the lowest
      dose (1250 uMol*min) being approximately 14% higher than standard. In the absence of
      dose-limiting toxicity, cohorts of 4-6 patients will be treated at each dose level and 10
      additional patients will be treated at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) to confirm safety.
      The busulfan dosing will begin at 1 mg/kg based on historical plasma levels obtained from
      patients receiving BU at a starting dose of 0.8 mg/kg at UCSF Medical Center.

      The highest dose level proposed for this study will exceed the reported toxic level for
      busulfan in the alloSCT setting. Patients will be followed closely for toxicity and strict
      stopping rules have been included. Eligibility criteria will exclude patients with prior
      history of hepatotoxicity or viral hepatitis. Potential hepatotoxic agents will not be
      allowed just prior to and during the busulfan dosing period. In addition, patients who
      experience hepatotoxicty during pre-transplant mobilization therapy may be excluded from
      receiving dose-escalated busulfan therapy. Every attempt will be made to prevent or avoid
      hepatotoxicity.

NCT01048931,Single-port Access Laparoscopic-assisted Vaginal Hysterectomy,"
      Minimally invasive surgery has become the standard treatment for many gynecologic disease
      processes. In the last decade, numerous studies have demonstrated that laparoscopic
      approaches to various gynecologic oncology conditions-particularly for early-stage
      endometrial and cervical cancers as well as select pelvic masses-is feasible and results in
      shorter hospital stays, improved quality of life and comparable surgical and oncologic
      outcomes to abdominal staging [1-5].For instance, the typical gynecologic robotic surgical
      procedure will require Two to three 5-mm ports and one 12-mm laparoscopic ports. Recently, an
      even less invasive alternative to conventional laparoscopy surgery has been developed:
      laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS), also known as single-port surgery. Single port
      laparoscopy is an attempt to further enhance the cosmetic benefits of minimally invasive
      surgery while minimizing the potential morbidity associated with multiple incisions. However,
      to our knowledge, there are no randomize control trial to evaluate of single port or multiple
      ports laparoscopic surgery in gynecologic disorders. The purpose of this study was to assess
      the feasibility of SPA-LAVH in the treatment of benign uterine disease.

      This study will carry out a preliminary ""proof of concept"" to evaluate two types of
      supplemental information that would serve as an adjunct to the traditional informed consent
      in a Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) vaccine clinical trial. These will be compared to the
      condition where the traditional informed consent form is used alone.

      Using four intervention sites, participants will be administered a standard HIV vaccine trial
      consent form. They will then be randomized into three conditions: 1) No supplemental
      information; 2) Supplemental information with 1-sided messages (emphasizes information
      content related to vaccine trial randomization and unproven efficacy of vaccine); and 3)
      Supplemental information with 2-sided messages (acknowledges the beliefs that are at odds
      with the information content and seeks to neutralize those beliefs through counter-argument).
      An interviewer-administered questionnaire (IAQ) Part 1 will be administered before the
      traditional HIV vaccine trial informed consent is reviewed with the participant. An IAQ Part
      2 will be administered directly after the HIV vaccine trial informed consent in the control
      condition or after reading through the supplemental material. Debriefing interviews will be
      conducted with selected participants to review their understanding of the study procedures

NCT01049386,Intestinal Permeability,"
      Rationale: Intestinal permeability of subjects can vary depending on their health status. It
      is therefore important to be able to measure and quantify intestinal permeability in a
      standardized way. Subjects with intestinal complaints (like irritable bowel disorder) or
      obese subjects have been found to have increased intestinal permeability. Different
      physiological conditions might affect intestinal permeability (IP) further.

      In the clinic, sugar absorption tests and different blood and urine markers have been used to
      quantify IP. The sugars sucrose, mannitol, sucralose and lactulose are absorbed differently
      in the small or large intestines, resulting in different sugar levels in urine. This
      indicates the level of intestinal permeability and the location of increased permeability
      which is more or less permeable.

      A high-fat meal could be used as a challenge test to increase IP in subjects even further.
      After a high fat meal, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) could be co-transported with chylomicrons.
      Small amounts of LPS co-transit with dietary fat from the gut after a high-fat meal, which
      thereby increases plasma LPS concentrations.

      Because of the above mentioned reasons, it could be relevant to determine intestinal
      permeability and plasma LPS concentration after consumption of a high-fat diet.

      Different methods will be used to determine the intestinal permeability in lean and obese
      men, under different conditions. New parameters, like intestinal (I) fatty acid binding
      protein (I-FABP), liver (L)-FABP, LPS and inflammatory markers will be measured and related
      to outcomes of tests, to examine the relation with intestinal permeability.

      The association of IP with whole body electrical resistance will be examined, to determine
      usefulness of a candidate non-invasive method for IP investigation.

      epigastric pain, dysphagia, heartburn and food impaction among other gastrointestinal
      symptoms along with obstructive esophageal symptoms in both pediatric and adult population.
      The pathology of this disease is postulated to be allergy mediated and the incidence of this
      disease is seen to parallel an increase in the incidence of allergies and asthma.

      Most of the current therapies for EoE are directed at decreasing esophageal allergic
      inflammation and mirror the treatment options for allergic asthma. Swallowed corticosteroids
      and elimination diets or elemental diets have shown variable efficacy is improving symptoms.
      However, specific pathophysiologic mechanism of EoE is still largely unknown and there is no
      definitive treatment that completely resolves symptoms and histological findings. Omalizumab
      is a recently developed anti-IgE antibody that has been shown to decrease the use of inhaled
      and oral corticosteroids and improve asthma related symptoms in patients with allergic

NCT01042847,How Our Immune System Can Help Fight Cancer,"
      There is growing evidence that our immune system can help fight cancer. This has stimulated
      interest in the development and application of tumor vaccines for several human solid tumors,
      including epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). A major obstacle to the development of these
      vaccines is that there are specialty cells called regulatory T cells that prevent the immune
      system from attacking all of our organs. These regulatory T cells also prevent our immune
      system for attacking cancer cells.

      Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), an enzyme that degrades an essential amino acid tryptophan
      that is necessary for T cells to multiply, however regulatory T cells are less susceptible to
      low levels of tryptophan, and can still multiply. This allows cancer growth and progression.
      This may be explained by genetic polymorphisms (changes) in the IDO gene, which may alter its
      function. Five of these changes in the IDO gene have been described. In this research
      project, we are asking if you would donate a small piece of your tumor and ascites to see if
      we can examine your IDO gene in the tumor cells and see if any of these gene changes are
      present. We hope that this will help us understand how the immune system works in EOC.

      We hypothesize that genetic polymorphisms within the IDO gene alter its enzymatic activity
      and affect the outcome of ovarian cancer patients. These findings have the potential to
      translate into a method for predicting successful immunotherapy.

NCT01048294,Blue Enriched Versus Standard Light Treatment for Seasonal Affective Disorder(SAD),"
      One of the most frequently investigated hypothesis of the pathophysiology underlying Seasonal
      Affective Disorder(SAD) or so called winterdepression is a disturbance of circadian rhythms.
      Since the circadian system is especially sensitive for the blue portion of the light
      spectrum, a new light therapy device with more blue light (blue enriched polychromatic light)
      was tested for its efficacy to treat SAD. In chronobiological terms this light is
      hypothesized to be more potent in inducing non-visual effects. In the present study
      fluorescent tubes that emit a high portion of short wavelength light on top of the normal
      wavelengths are tested for its superiority in treating SAD. This blue-enriched light (colour
      temperature 17000 ºK) is compared to standard light treatment (5000 º K) in SAD patients.,
      The investigators hypothesise that blue- enriched light improve the therapeutic effects of
      light treatment leading to a higher response or the same response in a shorter time schedule
      compared to standard light treatment.

NCT01046526,fMRI Study of Nicotinic Effect on Neurophysiology of Schizophrenia,"
      Background:

        -  Individuals who have schizophrenia are significantly more likely to smoke than the
           general population, which leads to increased smoking-related illnesses and high rates of
           nicotine dependence. Research suggests that high rates of smoking and nicotine addiction
           in people with schizophrenia are related to the fact that nicotine temporally improves
           performance in several cognitive tasks, including sensory gating, long-term memory, and
           visual tracking-all of which are affected by schizophrenia.

        -  Smoking among schizophrenia patients may be a form of self-medication, since nicotine
           may temporarily treat and improve cognitive deficits caused by schizophrenia.
           Researchers are interested in studying the effects of nicotine on the brain activity of
           individuals with schizophrenia to better understand how nicotine affects the brain
           regions connected to memory, visual tracking, and attention.

      Objectives:

        -  To identify specific brain regions involved in the anticipatory learning deficits found
           in schizophrenia patients who smoke.

        -  To determine whether and how nicotine enhances performance in these regions.

      Eligibility:

      - Smokers (at least 10 cigarettes per day) between 18 and 50 years of age who either are
      healthy volunteers or have been diagnosed with schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be asked to avoid consuming alcohol and restrict consuming caffeinated
           beverages for 24 hours before the study days. Participants will provide urine and breath
           samples at the start of the study to be tested for chemicals that may interfere with the
           study.

        -  The study will require two to four visits, with two fMRI sessions and other visits for a
           clinical interview or training.

      Participants will have a training session with a possible mock MRI scan to learn how to do
      tasks that track eye movement and measure ability to pay attention.

        -  During the fMRI scanning sessions, participants will receive either a nicotine patch or
           a placebo patch without nicotine. After the patch is in place, participants will perform
           tasks while receiving MRI scans. The scans will take up to 2 hours.

NCT01040949,En Pareja: A Latino Couples Intervention to Help Expectant Fathers Quit Smoking,"
      Smoking among Latino males living in the U.S. is a significant public health problem, one
      that can contribute to disparities in life expectancy and increase mortality. Latinos smoke
      at the same rate as White males but are less likely than Whites to quit. Interventions do not
      reach Latino smokers because many speak only Spanish and previous interventions have had
      notable limitations. First, most have recruited volunteers, so hard-to-reach Latino smokers
      likely did not participate. Second, cessation effects were short-term only. Third, no program
      has attempted to boost Latino cessation rates by capitalizing on a ""teachable moment"", a time
      when quitting may seem especially relevant. To address these deficits, we propose to conduct
      a teachable moment intervention trial for Latino smokers. We will attempt to capitalize on
      the potential teachable moment of Latinas' pregnancy as an impetus for Latinos' cessation. We
      will include couples, rather than just men, to sustain intervention effects. We will partner
      with community leaders to develop an intervention based primarily on Social Cognitive Theory,
      the Teachable Moment Model, and the Cognitive-Behavioral Couple Therapy Model. Some elements
      will be at the individual level to help Latinos quit smoking and others will be couple-based
      to improve communication and reduce stress in the postpartum relationship. The program will
      be culturally sensitive to Latino values, such as familismo, valuing of and duty to the
      family and personalismo, valuing warm personal relationships. We will recruit Latino couples
      (n=366) into a Guia (control) arm in which men receive a culturally appropriate smoking
      cessation guide, and a couple-based smoking cessation counseling arm.

      Hypothesis 1: Latino expectant fathers who receive couple-based counseling to quit smoking
      will be more likely to be abstinent from smoking at 28 weeks in pregnancy and 12 months
      post-randomization than Latino expectant fathers who receive a self-help smoking cessation
      guide.

      Hypothesis 2: Couple-based counseling will improve mediators, such as couple communication
      about smoking, self-efficacy, outcome expectancies, stress levels, risk perceptions, emotion,
      and self-image, which in turn, will increase cessation rates among Latino expectant fathers.

      Hypothesis 3: Couples in the counseling arm will have a greater increase in cessation during
      pregnancy and a lower decrease in cessation at 6 and 12 months post-randomization than
      couples in the Guia arm.

      ""Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease"". The hypothesis of an infectious burden as
      trigger or initiator of the inflammatory process in atherosclerosis has been extensively
      discussed in the past years. One part of this discussion is focused on the infectious agents
      responsible for periodontitis. Several studies have found an association of periodontitis
      and/or bacteria related to this disease and atherosclerosis. However, a study focussing on
      the prognostic relevance of these factors is missing.

      The hypothesis of this study is that periodontitis is a prognostic relevant risk factor for
      patients with angiographically proven coronary heart disease. Furthermore, the infectious
      pathogen burden by PCR-detection of periodontal pathogens will be evaluated as a prognostic
      factor.

      960 consecutive patients with angiographically proven coronary heart disease will be included
      in this study. After inclusion of patients an extensive periodontal examination including

      and others) will be performed. After 12 months patient will be follow up for any major
      adverse events (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke).

NCT01041898,The Bone-Fat-Pancreas Axis in Children,"
      The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that obesity and positive energy balance in
      children promote both low bone mass accrual and risk for diabetes through events that are
      mechanistically associated and that involve bone as an endocrine organ. Recent studies
      conducted in mice have uncovered the presence of a unique ""bone-fat-pancreas"" axis that
      regulates energy homeostasis, coordinates energy partitioning between bone and adipose
      tissue, and impacts insulin sensitivity. The adipocyte-derived hormone leptin, elevated
      levels of which reflect both adiposity and positive energy balance, inhibits bone formation
      via sympathetic activation. Decreased bone formation in turn depresses insulin sensitivity
      and secretion via decreased production of undercarboxylated osteocalcin (unOC), a novel
      bone-derived hormone. Although data from mice are compelling, this novel pathway has not been
      widely tested in humans. Sparse data from adult men and women suggest that this axis is
      active in humans, and that unOC is regulated in part by exercise. No data are available
      regarding the bone-fat-pancreas axis in children. Because the foundations of body composition
      trajectories and metabolic ""programming"" are established early in the life course, childhood,
      particularly during early stages of growth and development, is an especially salient time
      period for evaluating the bone-fat-pancreas axis. With this pilot grant, we propose to gather
      evidence that these interrelationships exist in children. The data from this project will be
      used to prepare an NIH R01 proposal to conduct a lifestyle-based intervention in children
      aimed both at reducing risk for osteoporosis and type 2 diabetes, and at identifying the role
      of unOC in metabolism and tissue partitioning.

      Hypothesis 1: Obesity and positive energy balance in children decrease bone mass via elevated
      leptin.

      Specific Aim 1: Determine the association between bone mass by DXA and serum leptin
      concentration in lean and obese children. We predict that body weight will be positively
      associated with bone mass, but that at any given body weight, bone mass will be lower in
      obese children, and that this difference will be explained by leptin.

      Hypothesis 2: Leptin-mediated suppression of unOC decreases insulin secretion through action
      on the β-cell, and decreases insulin sensitivity by inhibiting secretion of adiponectin from
      adipose tissue.

      Specific Aim 2: Determine the association between insulin secretion during oral glucose
      tolerance test (OGTT; from C-peptide modeling) and serum unOC in lean and obese children.
      Determine the association between insulin sensitivity during OGTT (derived from mathematical
      modeling) and serum unOC in lean and obese children. Obese children are less insulin
      sensitive, and in an absolute sense, secrete more insulin. However, we predict that at any
      given degree of insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion will be lower in obese children, and
      that this difference will be explained by unOC. unOC will be inversely associated with serum
      leptin, and will be positively associated with adiponectin and insulin sensitivity.

      Hypothesis 3: Physical activity prevents leptin suppression of unOC and partitions energy
      towards bone mineral at the expense of bone marrow adipose tissue.

      Specific Aim 3: Assess the interrelationships among physical activity using accelerometry,
      bone mass using DXA and bone marrow adipose tissue using magnetic resonance imaging. We
      predict that at any given level of serum leptin, active children will have greater unOC.
      Further, we predict that at any given body weight, active children will have greater bone
      mass and lesser bone marrow adipose tissue than inactive children.

NCT01044134,Think AHEAD (A Healthy Eating And Drinking) Study,"
      Advice to increase water consumption as part of a weight-reducing diet - typically to 8 cups
      (64 fl oz, ~2 L) per day (""8x8"" water recommendation) - is almost ubiquitously recommended by
      healthcare professionals. Many believe that water promotes weight loss through numerous
      physiological mechanisms. However, only limited observational data and virtually no
      experimental data exist regarding the effects of water consumption on body weight. In this
      study, we propose a randomized controlled pilot study in which two groups of overweight
      adolescents will receive a standard weight loss regimen, either with (experimental
      intervention) or without (control intervention) additional advice and support to increase
      water consumption. We will utilize individual sessions, an innovative text messaging
      protocol, and motivational telephone calls to promote adherence to the interventions. The
      purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate feasibility and obtain preliminary efficacy data,
      to inform design of a future, definitive study.

      It is hypothesized that increasing water consumption will improve the efficacy of a standard
      weight-reducing diet and will lead to decreased consumption of energy-containing beverages,
      decreased total energy intake, improved diet quality, improved immune status, and improved
      cardiovascular and diabetes risk factors. This simple behavioral intervention will be
      feasible and will significantly increase water consumption among participants in the
      experimental vs. control group.

NCT01047423,Targeting Microvascular Dysfunction in Young Hypertensive Patients,"
      Cholesterol and blood pressure lowering tablets have been shown to be of benefit in patients
      with established high blood pressure. High blood pressure is a very common medical condition
      that can lead to vascular complications i.e. problems with the blood vessels in the body. One
      way of detecting early changes in these blood vessels as a result of high blood pressure is
      to measure their compliance/flexibility with a noninvasive technique known as ultrasound and
      with a simple blood test. The investigators are trying to establish whether these early
      changes in blood vessels can be significantly improved by the use of both a cholesterol and
      blood pressure lowering tablet at an earlier stage than is currently advised. The
      investigators hope that the early combination of these tablets will prove more effective than
      the use of a blood pressure lowering tablet by itself and therefore possibly reduce the risk
      of long term complications developing.

NCT01041794,Tissue Partitioning in Early Childhood,"
      Early childhood (~4-6 years of age) is an important window for determining body composition
      trajectory and may be a critical period for the development of tissue partitioning patterns
      that influence later disease risk, including obesity and type 2 diabetes. As adiposity
      accelerates during this critical period, deposition/ preservation of fat stores may be
      sustained at the 'expense' of other tissues; i.e. energy homeostasis may be inherently biased
      toward fat gain. The type and amount of tissue mass accrued in early childhood has
      implications for metabolic profile, glucose/insulin homeostasis, hormone profile and resting
      energy expenditure.

      The interplay between fat and bone deposition represents a physiologic trait enabling the
      body to choose between shuttling 'energy' towards accrual of a particular tissue. Plausibly
      the phenotype underlying obesity and diabetes risk may be determined by the differentiation
      of cell type (adipocyte, osteocyte, etc.) during this early stage of growth and development.
      In vitro studies demonstrate transdifferentiation under the influence of specific external
      stimuli, which can switch phenotypes toward other cell lineages. Further, rodent models have
      demonstrated that exposure to stimuli (exercise) early in life may prevent excess fat mass
      accrual in adulthood, even when the stimulus is later removed (animals are no longer
      exercising). Children's early experiences (engagement in physical activity) may
      'environmentally induce' alterations in body composition and predispose individuals to
      diabetes throughout life (Figure 1).

      Hypotheses and Specific Aims: Early growth patterns and cell differentiation may induce long
      term effects on body composition by impacting biological and hormonal axes that regulate
      childhood body composition. Body composition comprises not only absolute mass, but also
      aspects of size, shape and location. To that end, the following specific aims will be
      evaluated:

        1. Quantify body composition, adipose tissue distribution, and relative tissue ratios using
           magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA).

             1. Hypothesis: Early partitioning of 'resources' toward fat mass accrual will lead to
                decreased gains in bone mass that may persist long-term.

             2. Hypothesis: Partitioning of tissue toward fat at the expense of bone mass (and
                indirectly, lean mass) will result in adverse effects on glucose/insulin
                metabolism, total energy expenditure, resting metabolic rate and hormone signaling.

             3. Hypothesis: Children with greater levels of physical activity (energy expenditure)
                will have greater partitioning towards bone (and lean) mass.

        2. Quantify adipose tissue distribution and adipocyte cell size and number using MRI and
           histological techniques.

             1. Hypothesis: A relatively greater amount of bone marrow adipose tissue will be
                apparent in those children with low levels of physical activity, resulting in the
                preferential differentiation of pluripotent stem cells towards adipocytes vs
                osteocytes in the bone marrow cavity.

             2. A relatively greater adipocyte cell number will be apparent in those children with
                low levels of physical activity indicating greater differentiation of MSC towards
                adipocytes vs osteocytes.

NCT01042353,Direct E-test on Bronchoalveolar Lavage From Patients With Ventilator-acquired Pneumonia,"
      -  Background: Ventilator-acquired pneumonia (VAP) is the most prevalent nosocomial
           infection in intensive care units (ICUs). Early microbiological diagnosis and initial
           administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy are associated with a better
           outcome. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should therefore be administered initially. However,
           inconsiderate antibiotic use can increase the prevalence of multi-resistant bacteria.

        -  Purpose: A rapid antimicrobial susceptibility method is required to decrease the
           unnecessary use of empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics. The aim of this study is to
           compare the efficiency of a rapid antibiogram, provided by E-test strips directly
           applied to bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples and analysed at 24 h, to that obtained
           with standard methods of culture which provide a later result.

        -  Study design: This will be an open-label, prospective cohort study of consecutive
           patients with VAP, conducted in a medical ICU. In addition to standard culture methods,
           an E-test will be performed directly on BAL samples and analysed at 24 h. Each standard
           BAL culture will be used as a control for the E-test method.

        -  Primary outcome: The occurrence of major errors, defined as isolates determined to be
           susceptible by the E-test but resistant by standard culture methods.

        -  Secondary outcomes: The occurrence of minor errors (defined as isolates determined to be
           resistant by the E-test and susceptible by the standard method), and a comparison of two
           methods of seeding BAL samples on Mueller Hinton agar plates (swabbing method, flooding
           method).

        -  Eligibility criteria:

             -  Inclusion criteria: all patients with suspected VAP (defined by a Clinical
                Pulmonary Infection Score ≥5) undergoing BAL will be eligible.

             -  Exclusion criteria: contraindications for BAL (PaO2/FIO2 <100, risk of
                bronchoscopy-related haemorrhagic complications), secondary exclusion of patients
                with negative cultures, defined by a threshold of bacteria <104 CFU/ml.

        -  Interventions:

      BAL samples will be cultured by standard methods and the minimal inhibitory concentration
      (MIC) of bacteria to the usual antibiotics will be determined using standard procedures. At
      the time of BAL collection, a rapid antibiogram will be performed by placing E-test
      antibiotic strips (AB Biodisk) directly onto Mueller-Hinton agar plates seeded with the BAL
      specimen (both by flooding and swabbing). E-test strips will be impregnated with cefoxitin,
      piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, imipenem, ciprofloxacin and amikacin. At 24 h, the E-test
      plates will be photographed and then examined separately by both a bacteriologist and a
      medical ICU physician following a consensus method. The final E-test results will be compared
      with the standard MIC cultures.

      able to reduce infarct size ?

      In in vivo studies, many experiments evidenced infarct size reduction, due to anti-apoptotic
      compounds, when given during reperfusion, after cardiac ischemia. In humans,
      post-conditioning offers such a protection, as the investigators have previously showed
      (Staat P et al. Post-conditioning the human heart. Circulation. 2005 112(14):2143-8).

      Infarct size reduction could lead to a reduced rate of complications (heart failure, rhythmic
      complications) and finally, morbidity and even mortality. This protection depends on
      anti-apoptotic properties (Zhao ZQ et al. Inhibition of myocardial injury by ischemic
      postconditioning during reperfusion: comparison with ischemic preconditioning. Am J
      Physiology Heart Circ Physiology 2003 Aug; 285(2):H579-88). Many drugs have been proposed to
      be able to mimic this phenomenon. Among them, many are efficient but toxic in vivo or
      difficult to manage (insulin, morphin). One of the most promising agent could then be
      erythropoietin (EPO) (Opie LH et al. Postconditioning for protection of the infarcting heart.
      Lancet. 2006; 367(9509):456-8). In order to target ischemia-reperfusion injuries, EPO impact
      is better and better demonstrated (e.g.: Mudalagiri NR. Erythropoietin protects the human
      myocardium against hypoxia and reoxygenation injury via phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase and
      ERK1-2 activation. Br J Pharmacol. 2007 Oct 22). The purpose of the study is to test this
      hypothesis in humans, on the onset of the reperfusion, after myocardial ischemia (acute
      myocardial infarct). EPO could contribute to protect myocardium against ischemia-reperfusion
      injury. This impact could rely on anti-apoptotic properties.

      The recent introduction of robotic surgical system has revolutionized the field of minimally
      invasive surgery. The investigators hypothesized that adoption of a robotic surgical system
      for patients with right-side colon cancer seems appealing because This system provides
      high-definition three-dimensional vision, eliminates physiologic tremor, and better
      ergonomics. This randomized controlled trial was designed to determine the safety and

      The results of the proposed experiments will directly inform clinicians who treat patients
      with osteoarthritis of the knee about how to maximize the benefits of acupuncture treatments.
      And because the experiments specifically asks the question of what is the relation between a
      patient's expectation of how a treatment will relieve their pain and the outcome of the
      treatment, the results will potentially inform care givers about all treatments for
      osteoarthritis and other chronic pain disorders. We hypothesize that acupuncture treatment
      will produce clinically significant analgesia as indicated by lowered sensory ratings of
      noxious stimuli and endogenous knee pain.

NCT01045590,"Glibenclamide (Dose to be Titrated From Starting Dose of 5mg om) Plus Rosiglitazone 4mg om (Increased to 8mg om After 6 Months) and vs Glibenclamide (Dose to be Titrated With Starting Dose of 5mg om) Plus Placebo, Administered to Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus","
      Rationale Rosiglitazone and troglitazone both promote differentiation of pre-adipocytes into
      adipocytes in subcutaneous, but not omental fat, and reduce gamma glutamyl transferase, a
      surrogate marker for intra-abdominal and hepatic fat. Troglitazone has been shown by
      abdominal computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan to reduce the
      intra-abdominal adipose tissue area in type 2 diabetics. Similarly rosiglitazone has also
      been shown to increase subcutaneous but not intra-abdominal fat in patients with type 2
      diabetes. In the same study it was also shown to cause a substantial reduction in hepatic
      fat. Central fat depots are believed to be associated with more cardiovascular risk than
      subcutaneous fat depots. By contrast, sulphonylurea-associated weight gain has been shown by
      abdominal CT scan to include increases in intra-abdominal adipose tissue.

      The aim of this study is to compare the body fat distribution pattern of glibenclamide plus
      rosiglitazone versus glibenclamide and placebo (especially the intra-abdominal adipose tissue
      and abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue areas) in patients with type 2 diabetes. It is
      hypothesised that rosiglitazone will lead to the accumulation of excess energy stores in the
      subcutaneous rather than the intra-abdominal adipose tissue depot. In addition, it is hoped
      that by having a positive effect on diastolic blood pressure, lipid levels, BMI,
      rosiglitazone will be shown to have a better cardiovascular risk profile when used in
      combination with glibenclamide rather than when glibenclamide is used alone.

      Although insulin resistance has been shown to be a primary defect causing type 2 diabetes
      mellitus, insulin secretory defect has also been known to be an important factor in the
      development of type 2 diabetes mellitus. A previous study has shown that in Korean patients,
      early-phase insulin secretory defect may be the initial abnormality in the development of
      type 2 diabetes mellitus [56].

      This study also aims to assess the efficacy and safety of glibenclamide plus rosiglitazone
      versus glibenclamide plus placebo therapy in Korean patients with type 2 diabetes. In
      addition, a previous study has shown that in Korean patients, early-phase insulin secretory
      defect may be the initial abnormality in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus. This
      study aims to show that rosiglitazone treatment in Korean patients, regardless of their early
      phase insulin secretory ability, is just as efficacious and safe.

      Objective(s) Primary To evaluate the effect of 12 months oral treatment with glibenclamide
      plus rosiglitazone versus oral glibenclamide plus placebo, on body fat distribution (as
      measured by the change in the ratio between the intra-abdominal adipose tissue and abdominal
      subcutaneous adipose tissue areas) in patients with type 2 diabetes.

        -  To investigate the efficacy of glibenclamide plus rosiglitazone, compared to
           glibenclamide plus placebo on fasting plasma glucose, insulin, fasting serum lipid

           cholesterol to HDL cholesterol ratio).

        -  To investigate the efficacy of glibenclamide plus rosiglitazone, compared to
           glibenclamide plus placebo on early phase insulin secretion during an oral glucose

        -  To define further the clinical safety and tolerability of glibenclamide plus
           rosiglitazone through the assessment of physical examinations, vital signs, weight,
           routine laboratory tests, adverse experiences and electrocardiograms (ECGs).

      are two types of external radiation treatments, proton beam and photon beam. In this study we
      will be examining the effects of proton beam radiation therapy. Studies have suggested that
      this kind of radiation can spare normal tissue more than photon radiation therapy. The
      physical characteristics of proton beam radiation let the doctor safely increase the amount
      of radiation delivered to the tumor. We believe that proton beam therapy will potentially

      Study objectives:

      Principal objective:

      To evaluate the tolerance and acceptability of Rasagiline versus Pramipexole (dopamine
      agonist).

      Secondary objectives: To evaluate the clinical benefits of Rasagiline administered as a
      monotherapy in patients presenting with early-stage Parkinson's disease.

      Study design:

      Multicentre comparative randomised parallel-group double-blind study, with a total duration
      of fifteen weeks (three weeks of dose titration and twelve weeks of follow-up), comprising
      four evaluations (D0, W3, W9, W15).

      Number of patients:

      240 patients (i.e. 120 in each group) presenting with early stage idiopathic Parkinson's
      disease.

      Number of centres:

      70 neurologists distributed throughout three French regions

      Treatment studied: Rasagiline Presentation: 1 mg tablets Dosage : 1 mg/day in a single dose,
      in the morning at breakfast-time.

      Comparator: Pramipexole Presentation: 0.125 mg, 0.25 mg and 1 mg pramipexole dihydrochloride
      monohydrate tablets (corresponding respectively to 0.088 mg, 0.18 mg and 0.7 mg of
      pramipexole)

      Dose-titration: As specified in the SPC for pramipexole, the product will be administered in
      three daily doses, preferably with meals, and the treatment will begin with a dose-titration
      phase of three weeks' duration, during which time the dosage will be gradually increased.

      On completion of the dose-titration phase, the minimum therapeutic dose of 1.5 mg per day
      must be achieved by all the patients. The patients who cannot achieve this dosage will be
      withdrawn from the study. The reason for stopping dose-titration (and leaving the study) will
      be detailed in the CRF.

      Dosage:

      The effective dosage of pramipexole should be adapted to the individual, depending on
      clinical response and tolerance, in successive stages of 0.75 mg at one-week intervals,
      without exceeding the maximum dose of 3 mg per day.

      Treatment prohibited during the study :

      Pethidine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, dextromethorphan, or any other MAOI, sympathomimetics
      (including nasal and oral decongestants containing ephedrine or pseudoephedrine), anti-H2s
      (cimetidine, ranitidine).

      Principal evaluation criterion :

      The principal criterion of evaluation is the percentage of patients who have presented with
      at least one "" significant "" adverse event during follow-up.

      A significant adverse event is defined as :

        -  a severe adverse event (SAE)

        -  an adverse event which in the opinion of the investigator requires suspension of the
           treatment or reduction in dosage

        -  an adverse event considered as severe or moderate by the patient (AEs of which the
           intensity has not been evaluated will be considered as moderate to severe)

      Secondary evaluation criteria:

        -  analysis of adverse events in the total population

        -  analysis of adverse events by degree of severity

        -  analysis of adverse events in subject over 65

        -  analysis of adverse events by symptom

        -  percentage of patients presenting with sleep problems (daytime drowsiness, narcolepsy,
           insomnia, fragmented sleep…)

        -  evaluation of Epworth Sleepiness Scale

        -  evaluation of quality of life (PDQ-8)

        -  evaluation of utilities by EuroQol (EQ-5D)

        -  overall clinical impression evaluated by the doctor (CGI-I) and by the patient (PGI-I)

        -  Global-Benefit-Risk (GBR)

        -  Evaluation of resources

      Analysis of the principal criterion:

      Analysis of the principal criterion will be carried out with those patients from the
      intention-to-treat population for whom tolerance data is available in at least one visit
      after D0.

      Comparative analysis The percentages of patients in the two treated groups who present with
      at least one significant adverse event will be compared using a Khi-2 test.

      Logistic regression A logistic regression analysis will be performed in order to explain the
      presence/absence of a significant event. The nature of the treatment and the centre will act
      as explanatory variables, and the initial scores as covariates. Analyses will also be
      performed on quantitative variables (ANCOVA)

      Evaluation of the Global Benefit-Risk (GBR) according to the model suggested by Chuang-Stein
      et al.

      Number of subject required:

      Calculation of the size is based on the hypothesis that the percentage of patients presenting
      with at least one significant adverse event during follow-up (principal evaluation criterion)
      will differ by 15% from one group to the other. With an alpha risk set at 5% and a beta ris
      kat 20%, the number of subjects required, calculated using the Casagrande et Pike formula, is
      110 subjects per group.

      The NSN was slightly overestimated in order to maintain the desired strength while taking
      into account the possibility of lost to follow-up, and was fixed at 240 patients.

NCT01040338,Effects of Nicotine on Brain Opioid Receptors,"
      A substantial body of evidence implicates the endogenous opioid system, and the mu opioid
      receptor (MOR) in particular, in the reinforcing effects of drugs of abuse, including
      nicotine. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the mu opioid receptor gene (OPRM1 Asp40)
      is associated with the ability to quit smoking, as well as nicotine reward and withdrawal
      symptoms. However, the precise mechanism through which this SNP influences nicotine
      dependence remains unresolved. This positron emission tomography (PET) study will examine
      whether this OPRM1 SNP alters MOR binding in response to nicotine in human smokers.
      Specifically, we will use [11 C]carfentanil PET imaging to assess the effects of intravenous
      (IV) nicotine versus saline (within-subject) on MOR binding potential in 24 chronic smokers
      genotyped prospectively and stratified by OPRM1 genotype.

      This phase II trial is studying how well rituximab works in preventing acute
      graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in patients undergoing a donor stem cell transplant for
      hematologic cancer. Giving chemotherapy and total-body irradiation before a donor stem cell
      transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It may also stop the patient's immune
      system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. The donated stem cells may replace the
      patient's immune cells and help destroy any remaining cancer cells (graft-versus-tumor
      effect). Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can also make an immune response
      against the body's normal cells. Giving a monoclonal antibody, rituximab, together with
      anti-thymocyte globulin, tacrolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil before and after the
      transplant may stop this from happening

NCT01048684,Comparison of Two Doses of Mannitol on Brain Relaxation During Supratentorial Craniotomy,"
      Neuroanesthesia for supratentorial surgery involves a thorough understanding of the
      physiopathology of intracranial pressure, cerebral homeostasis and regulation of cerebral
      perfusion pressure as well as the effects of anesthesia and surgery on these elements.

      The main objective of anesthesia during neurosurgery is to preserve the integrity of the
      brain by maintaining cerebral homeostasis, and assuring cerebral protection using
      normovolemia, normotension, normoglycemia, moderate hyperoxia and hypocapnia and
      hyperosmolality with the administration of mannitol.

      During surgery, the use of surgical retractors must be limited to avoid possible ischemia of
      the brain tissue. Surgical retractors can be replaced by chemical retractors. The concept of
      chemical retraction involves a reduction of cerebral blood flow, maintaining cerebral
      perfusion pressure, moderate hyperventilation, drainage of cerebrospinal fluid and
      osmotherapy.

      Mannitol, an osmotic agent, has been widely used to reduce the volume of the brain, the
      intracranial pressure and to facilitate the surgical approach in reducing the risk of
      cortical lesions during the opening of the skull.

      Mannitol 20% is usually given intravenously in bolus doses of 0.5-1g/kg over 30 minutes.
      However, over the last few years, the concept of a dose-response relationship has emerged.
      Some recent studies tend to demonstrate that higher doses of mannitol could reduce
      intracranial pressure significantly without any important side effects.

      The main objective of the present study is to compare two doses of mannitol (0.7 and 1.4
      g/kg) on brain relaxation during supratentorial craniotomies.

NCT01049607,Stapler Hepatectomy for Elective Liver Resection,"
      There is clinical uncertainty and ongoing discussion among liver surgeons regarding the
      optimal method of parenchymal transection in patients undergoing elective hepatic resection.
      While the clamp-crushing technique still represents the reference technique for routine liver
      resections, transection of liver parenchyma using vascular staplers may offer a new and safe
      technique potentially reducing intraoperative blood loss, operation time as well as
      peri-operative morbidity. As morbidity of patients undergoing hepatic resection remains high,
      approaches to lower peri-operative complications are urgently required. Due to the lack of
      evidence it has to be evaluated, if the technique of stapler hepatectomy decreases
      intraoperative blood loss as a highly relevant predictor of peri-operative complications,
      patients' hospital stay and finally health care expenditures. These advantages would favor
      stapler hepatectomy to be applied in routine liver resections. As RCTs are generally
      considered to generate the most valid scientific evidence on a treatment's effects, the
      present trial evaluates potential benefits of stapler hepatectomy in a randomized fashion.

NCT01049191,Bone Microarchitecture in Women With and Without Fracture,"
      Osteoporosis is a common disorder of compromised bone strength causing 40-50% of women and
      ~25% of men to sustain fragility fractures during their lifetime. The reduction of bone
      strength in osteoporotic people results from loss of bone density and deterioration of bone
      quality. Bone quality is a complex amalgamation including macro- and micro-architecture,
      mineralization, turnover and damage accumulation. Currently, medications to reduce fracture
      risk are prescribed primarily on the basis of bone mineral density (BMD) measurement.
      Unfortunately, currently available BMD measurement technologies do not detect the
      aforementioned properties of bone quality; as such, less than half of individuals who sustain
      osteoporotic fractures are classified as ""osteoporotic"" by currently available diagnostic
      tools. Clearly, measures to enhance identification of those at high fracture risk are needed.
      High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (HR-MRI) technology, such as that provided by
      MicroMRI, Inc., has outstanding potential to be such a tool. Therefore, our long-term goal is
      to evaluate and optimize the use of HR-MRI in fracture risk prediction; this pilot work is an
      essential step in attaining this goal.

      This research will investigate 72 postmenopausal women with normal or osteopenic BMD by
      dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), 36 with prior low-trauma fractures will be compared
      with 36 age-, race- and BMD matched women without fracture. We hypothesize that 1.) Women
      with fractures will have evidence of microarchitectural deterioration on HR-MRI and 2.) Newly
      developed, more rapid MRI sequences designed at the UW will provide similar trabecular
      microstructure information more rapidly than the currently used, albeit investigational,
      technology produced by MicroMRI, Inc.

      Our specific aims are to a) Evaluate differences in MicroMRI parameters of trabecular
      microstructure (bone volume fraction, trabecular thickness, surface/curve ratio and erosion
      index) between age-, race- and BMD-matched postmenopausal women with and without fracture;
      b.) Correlate T2* relaxation time (a rapid indirect MRI measure of trabecular density and
      microstructure) with BMD measured by DXA, and microstructural parameters measured by
      MicroMRI. As an exploratory aim we will investigate HR-MRI parameters of trabecular
      microstructure obtained using a newly developed, rapid MRI sequence referred to as IDEAL-FSE
      with parameters obtained using the currently available MicroMRI, Inc. sequence.

      The number of OEF/OIF veterans seeking care and rehabilitation services within the VA Health

      and can adversely affect a veteran's ability to reintegrate into civilian life, return to
      duty, succeed in competitive employment, or function independently. The primary product of
      the proposed study would be an empirically validated, manualized, cognitive rehabilitation
      intervention for OIF/OIF veterans with cognitive disorders. The group treatment modality has
      the virtue of efficiency and a manualized treatment approach would allow wide-ranging
      application throughout the VHA system. As such, the proposed study is likely to have a
      significant effect on the quality and effectiveness of rehabilitative services being offered
      to our returning soldiers with combat-related MTBI and cognitive impairment.

      The main aim of this study is to analyze and report the preliminary and intermediate term
      outcomes after laparoscopic revision Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery for weight recidivism.
      The foremost outcome measurements are 1) Fat loss mainly measured as weight loss and

      nutritional status and metabolic complications.

      Consequently, secondary objectives of this study are 1) to assess failure rate defined as
      percentage of excess weight loss < 50% , lowest BMI >35 for morbidly obese (MO) or >40 for
      superobese (SO), and/or lack of resolution/improvement of major comorbidities at the point in

      Effectiveness of health education regarding the smoking habit is under discussion .
      Nevertheless, according to the literature, some personal, familiar, cultural, and social
      factors are considered risk factors for students to become smokers. Probably, a health
      education intervention integrated in the school program will show a higher rate of
      effectiveness regarding incidence and prevalence of smoking habit in this age-group .

      OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of a health education program to reduce the smoking
      habit in students.

      METHODOLOGY: Quasi-experimental design including all the junior high school students in an
      educational district in Tarragona (Spain). The sampled schools will be randomised into two

NCT01043614,"Peer Education, Exercising and Eating Right - Obesity Prevention in Freshmen Women","
      Project PEER utilizes a randomized controlled study design to investigate the combined
      effects of an exercise and nutrition intervention that is based on self-efficacy principles
      and delivered primarily by peer educators to reduce the risk for obesity in female college
      freshman over one academic year (N = 300). The control group will receive minimal interaction
      from the research team, paralleling the typical freshman experience on the UIUC campus.
      Recruitment will take place in two waves (consecutive fall terms with n = 150).

      During the final year (Fall 2010) of the project, a General Education course will be offered
      that targets weight management. Importantly, the discussion groups for this course will be
      taught by peer educators trained using the peer resources further refined during the PEER
      project. In addition to conventional measures of content knowledge assessed in the college
      classroom when obtaining class credit, personal physical activity and nutrition behaviors
      along with behavioral determinants (self-efficacy, self-regulatory skills and outcome
      expectations) will also be assessed.

      Primary Aim 1: To determine the effectiveness of a peer-delivered self efficacy-based
      behavioral intervention to enhance nutrition and physical activity behaviors and subsequently
      weight management success in female university freshman over one academic year. We
      hypothesize that freshmen randomized to the intervention group will be more successful in
      losing or maintaining weight than the control group through a combination of diet and
      physical activity strategies.

      Primary Aim 2: To examine the role played by social cognitive factors in changing nutrition
      and physical activity behaviors across one academic year. We hypothesize that self-efficacy
      will have both a direct influence on behavior and an indirect effect through its influence on
      self-regulatory skills and outcome expectations.

      include:

        1. In raltegravir arm compared with nevirapine arm, fewer patients will require methadone
           dose adjustment to abate methadone withdrawal symptoms. Also the average methadone dose
           to achieve adequate serum methadone concentrations in patients on the raltegravir-based
           regimen will be lower compared to that of patients on the nevirapine-based regimen.

        2. Clinical outcomes in terms of viral suppression, CD4 recovery and occurrence of
           opportunistic infections will be comparable in the two arms at 6 months and one year.

      significant problem in Pediatric Intensive Care Units, affecting up to 16 of every 1000
      children admitted to these units. These disorders carry with them high mortality rates as
      well as numerous long-term effects for the surviving children. As the effects of these
      diseases have significant social and economic ramifications for affected children and their
      families, research on the development of ALI/ARDS could significantly change how physicians
      understand the disease and treat patients.

      There are a wide range of problems which make certain PICU patients more likely to develop
      either ALI or ARDS. This research aims to determine which of these children are at the
      greatest risk for ALI/ARDS by examining differences in plasma biomarkers and in DNA of a

NCT01042951,To Determine the Safety and Immunogenicity of an Oral Whole Cell ShanChol Cholera Vaccine in Bangladesh,"
      Background: Severe dehydrating cholera due to V. cholerae O1 is an important public health
      problem in Bangladesh and many other developing countries. V. cholerae O1 is a major
      bacterial pathogen causing around 5 million cases and at least 200,000 deaths in adults and
      children each year. It can be assumed that there are at least 300,000 severe cases and 1.2
      million infections in people in Bangladesh alone. The rate of cholera varies from around 1 to
      8 per 1000 population and the highest attack rate is in children 2- to 9-year years of age .
      Cholera is now also being documented in very young children. Currently enteric vaccine
      approaches are regarded as the most accessible short term and practical means to prevent and
      control such illnesses to prevent disease and epidemics in resource poor settings with
      limited public health and sanitary facilities.

      An effective inactivated whole cell bivalent cholera vaccine against Vibrio cholerae O1 and
      O139 was produced and implemented for public health purposes in Vietnam since the 1990s. This
      bivalent vaccine has been found to be safe and to confer significant protection against El
      Tor cholera in both children and adults and has over the last decade being used in the
      Vietnam to protect against cholera. This vaccine has further been reformulated by the IVI to
      meet WHO requirements and is now being produced in WHO prequalified vaccine company in India.

      The reformulated vaccine has been shown to be safe and immunogenic in Indian children as well
      as adults. A large Phase III study of the vaccine, has recently been carried out in Kolkata,
      India in over 120,000 participants aged from one year and above. Results of the study are
      encouraging and the vaccine gives over 60% protection against cholera. The vibriocidal
      antibody response rate was 80% in children and 53% in adults. Following this study, the
      vaccine, designated as ShanChol has been licensed in India in April 2009. The vaccine is now
      being marketed in India and is available at a cost affordable for developing country
      settings.

      Objective: The aim of the proposed study is to assess if the orally administered, killed,
      bivalent whole-cell cholera vaccine, ShanChol will be safe and immunogenic in different age
      groups in Bangladesh in children and adults.

      Study design: This will be a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study on a total of
      330 subjects, 165 vaccine and 165 placebo recipients. The specific aims will be to determine:
      i) safety and determine adverse events if any (ii) determine immune responses.

      Relevance: The study of ShanChol on Bangladeshi children and adults will be able to give
      information regarding the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine in Bangladeshi subjects.
      This information will be important for proceeding with larger studies in Bangladesh and if
      proven useful for introduction the cholera vaccine in the country in the future.

      to 660 adolescent patients from Duke University Health System (DUHS) Primary Care Clinics
      will take part in this study.

      Patients will be identified by research study staff and asked if they would be willing to
      have their clinic visit audio recorded for research purposes. There are three phases of data
      collection. First, baseline encounters (n=200, 4 per physician) are audio recorded. Then,
      half of the physicians will be randomized to receive a tailored web-based intervention
      containing information about evidence-based techniques to help adolescents attain a healthy
      weight. A new set of 200 encounters (4 per physician) will be audio recorded. Then, all
      physicians will receive a Summary Report that outlines the adolescent's high risk behaviors
      that contribute to weight (sweetened beverages, fast food, breakfast, physical activity,
      screen time, and sleep) and a new set of 200 encounters will be audio recorded.

NCT01040910,Cannabis for Inflammatory Bowel Disease,"
      Background: The marijuana plant Cannabis has been used for centuries in the medicinal
      treatment of many disorders and is still the subject of medical research and public debate.
      Cannabinoids have been purported to alleviate a variety of neurological conditions such as
      MS-related symptoms including spasticity, pain, tremor and bladder dysfunction. Other
      neurological conditions like chronic intractable pain, dystonic movement disorders and
      Tourette's Syndrome were all reported to be alleviated by cannabis use. Cannabis has been
      used to treat anorexia in AIDS and cancer patients. In gastroenterology cannabis has been
      used to treat symptoms and diseases including anorexia, emesis, abdominal pain,
      gastroenteritis, diarrhoea, intestinal inflammation and diabetic gastroparesis.

      Cannabinoids have also a profound anti inflammatory effect, mainly through the CB2 receptor.
      Cell mediated immunity may be impaired in chronic marijuana users. And a potent
      anti-inflammatory effect of cannabis was observed in rats . Studying the functional roles of
      the endocannabinoid system in immune modulation reveals that there are no major immune events
      which do not involve the endocannabinoid system. Cannabinoids shift the balance of
      pro-inflammatory cytokines and anti-inflammatory cytokines towards the T-helper cell type 2
      profiles (Th2 phenotype), and suppress cell-mediated immunity whereas humoral immunity may be
      enhanced. They are therefore used for various inflammatory conditions including rheumatoid
      arthritis and asthma. In a mouse model of colitis cannabinoids were found to ameliorate
      inflammation and there are many anecdotal reports about the effect of cannabis in
      inflammatory bowel disease. However, there are no methodical reports of the effect of
      cannabis on inflammatory bowel disease. The aim of the proposed study is to examine in a
      double blind placebo controlled fashion the effect of smoking cannabis on disease activity in
      patients with IBD.

NCT01041170,Antagonist-Elicited Cannabis Withdrawal,"
      Background: Rimonabant, a CB1 receptor antagonist, blocks effects of cannabinoids and, in
      dependent animals, elicits cannabinoid withdrawal. No studies have examined
      rimonabantelicited cannabis withdrawal in humans.

      Goals: (1) Determine the lowest single dose of oral rimonabant that elicits measurable
      cannabinoid withdrawal. (2) Characterize cognitive performance, subjective state,
      physiological condition, and regional brain activation (measured by functional magnetic
      resonance imaging [fMRI]) during acute and chronic administration of oral delta
      9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and during cannabis withdrawal. (3) Characterize the
      pharmacokinetics of oral THC and metabolites in body fluids and hair and of rimonabant in
      plasma.

      Subject Population: Up to 60 completing cannabis users aged 18-45 (up to 24 in Experiment I,
      36 in Experiment II) and 18 completing non-drug-using controls (Experiment II). Enrollment
      target is 82% Caucasian, 14% African American, 4% other; 9% Hispanic; 35% women.

      Experimental Design and Methods: Experiment I: In this within-subject, randomized,
      double-blind, dose-escalation study, six participants receive 7 days of THC (40-120 mg/day).
      On Day 8, five participants receive 20 mg rimonabant; one receives placebo. If withdrawal
      criteria (greater than or equal to 150% or 2.5-fold increase in selected visual-analog
      scales) are not met in all five participants receiving rimonabant, separate groups of six are
      similarly treated with 40, 60 or 80 mg rimonabant, if necessary. The PI and MRP will submit
      all adverse events and relevant cardiovascular and scientific data to the IRB at the
      completion of each rimonabant dose panel. When the extramural NIDA DSMB is in place, it will
      review all data collected to date and develop and implement a monitoring plan, including
      review on completion of each dose cohort. DSMB recommendations will be reviewed by the
      Sponsor, Clinical Director and IRB before proceeding to the next dose cohort. In addition, if
      any subject has an intolerable adverse event (ie, an adverse event leading to study
      discontinuation) or serious adverse event in response to rimonabant on Day 8, the blind for
      that subject will be broken, and a report sent to the Sponsor, the extramural NIDA DSMB when
      in place and the IRB for discussion.

      Experiment II: In this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study, 36 participants
      receive 7 days of THC (40-120 mg/day). On Day 8, 18 participants receive rimonabant dose
      determined in Experiment I to elicit cannabis withdrawal; 18 participants receive placebo
      rimonabant to evaluate spontaneous cannabis withdrawal. Cognitive, psychological,
      physiological and hormonal measures are monitored to determine onset, magnitude, and duration
      of THC intoxication and withdrawal and to correlate with THC and rimonabant pharmacokinetics.
      Changes in blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal are determined with five fMRI scans
      throughout the study. Eighteen non-drug-using controls undergo scanning and cognitive testing
      at similar intervals.

      Risks and Benefits: The proposed doses of THC and rimonabant have been well tolerated in
      other studies. The most common side effects of oral THC are sedation, cognitive impairment,
      euphoria, poor coordination, tachycardia, and hypotension. Spontaneous withdrawal from
      cannabis is mild and medically benign. Experience with other drugs suggests that
      antagonist-elicited cannabis withdrawal may have an earlier onset and greater intensity than
      spontaneous cannabis withdrawal. There are no clinical benefits to participants. Scientific
      benefits are greater understanding of cannabis intoxication, tolerance, and withdrawal and of
      the role of rimonabant in eliciting cannabis withdrawal.

NCT01047254,Bupropion for the Treatment of Apathy in Alzheimer's Dementia,"
      Apathy in dementia prevents successful application of non-pharmacological treatments,
      accelerates cognitive and functional decline and increases disease-related costs by earlier
      need for full-time care. Apathy is a distinct entity and occurs independently of other
      neuropsychiatric syndromes, like depression.

      Today, there is no high-level evidence for any effective treatment of apathy in AD. In
      contrast to other neuropsychiatric syndromes in AD, like psychosis and depression, and
      despite its high prevalence and clinical relevance, apathy has never been the primary outcome
      in a clinical trial. Basic and clinical research has provided a distinct model of the
      pathophysiology of apathy with dopamine and norepinephrine as the key neurotransmitter
      systems involved. The antidepressant Bupropion is a dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake
      inhibitor. There is evidence from case-series, that Bupropion reduces apathy in patients with
      organic brain disorders. This study will test the efficacy and safety of Bupropion in the
      treatment of apathy in AD in a 12-week multicenter doubleblind placebo controlled trial.
      Secondary endpoints will be quality of life of patients, caregivers' distress, ability of
      patients to perform activities of daily living,utilization of healthcare resources by
      patients and by caregivers, and cognitive functions.

NCT01041664,Bad Genes or Genes Behaving Badly,"
      A key factor in the determination of body composition over the lifecourse is fat accumulation
      during childhood. Periods of life associated with the greatest changes in organ development
      and growth, i.e. early childhood, have the most significant effect on body composition,
      energy balance, and metabolism. Early childhood (age 3 to 7 years) represents a critical
      transition for the basis of adaptability in body composition, due to the rapid growth and
      development that occurs. Plausibly the phenotype underlying obesity and related health risk
      may be determined by body composition during this critical period.

      Our previous research in children has consistently indicated that HA children accumulate
      greater amounts of fat, particularly in the intra-abdominal compartment, even at similar a
      BMI, and lower bone mineral content relative to EA children. The reason for these differences
      in body composition over the lifecourse is not clear.

      Racial/ethnic differences in risk factors for health, including 'thriftiness' in body fat
      accumulation are often evident before the age of 7, suggesting that the racial/ethnic
      differences in energy utilization and subsequent fat storage may be accounted for by genetic
      make-up, the environment (e.g. diet), or an interaction of the two. The physiologic or
      behavioral process(es) that cause(s) certain children to take a trajectory towards obesity
      while others accrue less fat is not known. However, the economic decision of fuel utilization
      is a physiologic trait enabling the body to choose between shuttling 'energy' towards accrual
      of a particular tissue (e.g. bone vs. fat) and this trait likely has a genetic component.
      This genetic component may be embedded in fat storage capacity evolved from gene by
      environment interactions that promote thrift, particularly conserved in some populations.
      Although genetic background plays a role, it not known whether there is a relationship
      between genetic background, known candidate genes or candidate pathways and environmental
      contributors (e.g. diet) that impact body composition trajectory. Of central importance to
      our understanding of early fat mass accumulation in health disparities are the mechanisms
      that lead to chronic disease progression.

      It is likely that variations within candidate genes may have a differential impact on
      individuals based on their genetic background. It is also probable that body composition is
      influenced by many genes, often within the same metabolic pathways, with small individual
      effects. These genes may not be significantly associated individually, but when examined as a
      unit (in a candidate pathway or gene-gene interaction framework) the association becomes
      significant. Further, children's early environmental exposures (e.g. diet) may interact with
      both genetic background and variations in candidate genes along resulting in alterations in
      body composition that predispose HA to excess fat accumulation throughout the lifecourse. To
      that end, the following specific aims will be evaluated:

      Aim 1. To examine the associations between genetic admixture and body composition in children
      aged 3-7 years after controlling for dietary intake.

        1. Hypothesis 1.1: There is a direct association between Amerindian admixture and fat mass
           and in inverse association between Amerindian admixture and bone mass.

        2. Hypothesis 1.2: There is a direct association between energy intake and fat accumulation
           and the relationship will be particularly evident in individuals with a greater
           proportion of Amerindian admixture.

      Aim 2. To examine the associations between genetic admixture and bone marrow fat in children
      aged 3-7 years after controlling for dietary intake.

        1. Hypothesis 2.1: There is a direct association between Amerindian admixture and bone
           marrow fat.

        2. Hypothesis 2.2: There is a direct association between energy intake and fat accumulation
           in bone marrow and the relationship will be particularly evident in individuals with a
           greater proportion of Amerindian admixture.

      Aim 3. To examine the relationship between variation in candidate genes and pathways and
      Amerindian admixture controlling for dietary intake.

      a. Hypothesis 3.1: Amerindian admixture will be associated with variations in candidate genes
      and pathways known to be associated with fat accumulation.

NCT01049828,Resting-State Neural Connectivity in Patients With Subjective Tinnitus Without Bother,"
      Tinnitus is the occurrence of an auditory sensation without the presence of an acoustic
      stimulus. Approximately, 50 million people in the United States experience chronic tinnitus
      and 15 million of these people have bothersome tinnitus. Several studies have shown that
      people who are bothered by their tinnitus have difficulty in concentration and focus. Through
      imaging modalities we have deranged neural networks responsible for attention. Only 20
      percent of patients diagnosed with tinnitus are severely bothered. We seek the following:

        1. Match a group of non-bothered tinnitus patients on age and hearing status to an existing
           cohort of bothered tinnitus patients.

        2. Assess the resting-state neural connectivity in patients with non-bothersome tinnitus.
           Findings from the comparison of functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging
           (fcMRI) from subjects with bothersome tinnitus in our current rTMS clinical trial to
           normal age-matched controls without tinnitus demonstrates that subjects with bothersome
           tinnitus have dramatic alterations in cortical attention and control networks. Our
           hypothesis is that the fcMRI-defined changes in the attention and control networks
           reflect the impact of excessive auditory stimulation in patients with bothersome
           tinnitus and explains the difficulty with concentration, short-term memory, and other
           common problems. To fully test this hypothesis we need to obtain fcMRI of the attention
           network among subjects with tinnitus but without bother and compare the status of their
           neural networks with those of tinnitus subjects with bother and with normal controls.

        3. Compare the resting cortical networks in subjects with non-bothersome tinnitus to
           subjects with bothersome tinnitus and subjects without tinnitus Our null hypothesis is
           that there are no differences in the resting-state cortical networks, especially the
           attention and control networks, between tinnitus patients who do not experience bother,
           tinnitus patients who do experience bother, and subjects without tinnitus. Through
           fcMRI, we will examine correlations in blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signals in
           established auditory, attention, control, and other brain regions in the resting brain
           and compare these findings to already collected fcMRI scans of bothered tinnitus
           patients, and controls (patients without tinnitus).

NCT01044927,Advanced eHealth for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) in Colorado,"
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the 4th leading cause of death in the United
      States, affects 24 million people and is responsible for up to $32 billion annually in direct
      and indirect health care costs. Based upon these national COPD prevalence data, we estimate
      that 483,000 Coloradans have COPD (193,000 diagnosed and 290,000 undiagnosed), and that the
      care of these patients costs up to $490 million annually. Therefore, to alter the impact of
      COPD on the State and People of Colorado, we propose to introduce a telephone-dependent,
      internet-supported, self-monitoring ""eHealth"" management system in both urban and rural
      Colorado settings in order to decrease healthcare utilization, improve the management of COPD
      based upon current national guidelines, improve quality of life, reduce health care costs
      decrease COPD exacerbations. We base this program on a successful clinical pilot study,
      performed at the University of Colorado Hospital (UCH) during 2004-2005, which demonstrated
      dramatic improvements in quality of life and decreased health care costs. We propose to
      enroll patients with advanced COPD, or a history of COPD exacerbations, because these are the
      patients with the highest healthcare costs, the greatest disability, and the highest
      mortality. The ultimate goal of this project is to demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy
      of this proactive management strategy as it is disseminated throughout urban and rural
      Colorado. In this first phase we will target two Denver Metro sites, UCH and
      Kaiser-Permanente (KP), and rural sites (to be determined). We chose these urban sites
      because of their strong interest in enacting the eHealth Program, because of their organized
      systems of healthcare delivery and because of the numbers of COPD patients that they serve.
      We are particularly enthusiastic about the application of this technology to rural,
      underserved areas, because this approach has the potential to dramatically improve delivery
      of healthcare to a large portion of Colorado that is chronically plagued by inadequate health
      care networks and lack of specialty care. More broadly, we are enthusiastic about the
      prospect that eHealth programs may hold the potential to improve healthcare delivery for many

NCT01047709,Positional Therapy After Stroke,"
      Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability and the third leading cause of death in the
      United States. Unfortunately, there are few therapies that have been proven to improve stroke
      outcome. Sleep apnea is an emerging stroke risk factor and has a well established association
      with higher mortality and poor functional outcome following stroke. Over half of acute stroke
      patients have sleep apnea, suggesting that it may be a important target for therapy.
      Attenuation of sleep apnea severity may result in improved stroke outcomes. However, the
      standard treatment for sleep apnea is not well-tolerated among stroke patients. An
      alternative treatment is avoidance of supine sleep. Supine sleep is very common in acute
      stroke patients, and therefore this treatment may have particular relevance to the stroke
      population. The proposed study will be conducted in two phases. The first phase is a
      randomized, crossover design in which acute stroke patients will be given positional
      treatment (to avoid supine sleep) on one night during their stroke hospitalization. This will
      be compared with another night of sleeping without positional therapy. The order of
      treatments (standard vs positional therapy) will be random. The first phase will demonstrate
      the proof of concept: that stroke patients given positional therapy to avoid supine sleep
      will (1) sleep less on their backs, and (2) will have improved sleep apnea parameters with
      positional therapy. In the second phase, those identified to have sleep apnea will be
      randomized to receive positional therapy at home for three months, or standard therapy. This
      second phase will demonstrate the adherence/feasibility of three months of positional
      therapy, and will allow us to estimate effect size based on a functional outcome measure. The
      data obtained from this pilot clinical trial are essential to plan a large efficacy study.

NCT01049542,Effects of Urocortins on Forearm Arterial Blood Flow in Healthy Volunteers,"
      Impairment of the heart's pumping capacity (heart failure) remains a major clinical problem
      with a poor prognosis and the search for novel treatments remains an important area of
      research.

      Urocortins are proteins that appear to increase blood flow and heart pumping activity. There
      has been particular interest in the role of Urocortins 2 & 3 (subtypes of Urocortins) in
      heart failure.

      In this study, we will examine the effects and mechanisms of Urocortins 2 & 3 and the
      Corticotrophin Releasing Hormone Receptor Type 2 (CRH-R2) receptor (through which urocortins
      act) on forearm blood flow and release of natural blood clot dissolving factors in the
      forearm circulation of healthy volunteers.

      In this study, we will look at the role of the lining of the blood vessel (endothelium) in
      response to urocortin types 2 and 3. We hypothesise that urocortins 2 & 3 act via the
      endothelium to cause dilatation of the blood vessels and release of tissue-plasminogen
      activating factor (blood clot dissolving factor). We also hypothesise that urocortins have a
      role in maintaining the normal baseline level of blood flow in forearm arteries. In addition
      to the above, we will also look at the effect of temporarily blocking the effect of
      urocortins, using a specially designed blocker drug (Astressin 2B).

      Utilising the well-established technique of 'forearm venous occlusion plethysmography', we
      will be able to focus on the local effects of urocortins on arterial blood flow in forearm
      vessels, without affecting this system in the body as a whole.

NCT01041196,Perforated Marginal Ulcer After Gastric Bypass,"
      A common late complication after gastric bypass surgery is marginal ulceration that is
      defined as ulcers at the margins of the gastrojejunostomy, mostly on the jejunal side. Most
      marginal ulcers respond to medical therapy and complicated or complex ulcer disease warrants
      operative intervention; specifically, perforated, penetrated, obstructing, bleeding and
      intractable marginal ulcers require surgical intervention.

      Diverse operative strategies for addressing perforated marginal ulcers after gastric bypass
      have been described including I) Omental (Graham) patch repair, II) Revision of
      gastrojejunostomy, III) Irrigation and drainage, IV) any previous procedure with truncal

      the laparoscopic resection and repair of acutely perforated marginal ulcers after Roux-en-Y
      gastric bypass (RYGB), with or without concomitant resolution of technical risk factors for
      marginal ulceration.

NCT01048736,Investigating Fitness Interventions in the Elderly (INFINITE),"
      Aging is associated with declines in aerobic capacity, exercise tolerance, and functional
      endurance that lead to physical disability and loss of independence. Furthermore, the
      existing high prevalence of obesity in the elderly is greatly exacerbating these
      aging-related declines in function. To date, regular exercise is the only known therapy to
      consistently improve aerobic function, and perhaps delay the onset of disability. Although
      aerobic exercise training does benefit both aerobic capacity and endurance even in obese
      persons, some data show that the maximal efficacy of exercise for improving aerobic function
      is blunted by obesity. In addition, our preliminary data show a potential dose-response
      benefit of concomitant fat loss on exercise-induced improvements in aerobic function. Thus,
      combining an exercise intervention with caloric restriction resulting in fat loss may be more
      efficacious for improving aerobic function than exercise alone in obese elderly, a population
      at high risk for disability. The purpose of this study is to determine whether the amount of
      fat loss (achieved through controlled underfeeding) affects the magnitude of improvement in
      aerobic function (maximal aerobic capacity and endurance) in response to a standardized
      exercise training stimulus that follows current recommendations for older persons.

NCT01040819,Does Pioglitazone Increase the Production of 15-EPI-Lipoxin A4?,"
      Type-2 diabetes mellitus is a public health concern. Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus
      are at high risk of developing cardiovascular complications. Diabetic patients are two to
      four-times more likely to develope cardiovascular disease. The mortality of diabetic patients
      with cardiovascular disease is much higher than in non-diabetic matched patients with
      cardiovascular disease. Recently, it has become apparent that not all anti-diabetic drugs
      have the same effect on the progression of atherosclerosis and on cardiovascular outcomes.
      There is a great need to understand the potential protective mechanisms of the various
      anti-diabetic drugs in order to decrease their risk for cardiovascular morbidity and
      mortality. In addition to increasing insulin sensitivity, Pioglitazone (PIO) has
      anti-inflammatory properties. However, the underlying mechanisms of these anti-inflammatory
      (and probably anti-atherosclerotic) effects of PIO are unknown. We have shown in the rat that
      3-day pretreatment with PIO increases myocardial cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) activity and levels
      of both 6-keto-PGF1a, the stable metabolite of prostacyclin (PGI2) and 15-epi-lipoxin A4, a
      lipid mediator with a strong anti-inflammatory properties. Prostacyclin inhibits platelet
      aggregation and causes vasodilatation. Increased levels of 6-keto-PGF1a and 15-epi-lipoxin A4
      may thus be the explanation for the anti-inflammatory and anti-atherosclerosis effects of
      PIO. Several clinical studies have shown that COX2 inhibition is associated with increased
      cardiovascular events. Thus, augmenting COX2 activity and the production of prostacyclin and
      15-epi-lipoxin A4 may have potential favorable effects. The purpose of the study is to test
      whether PIO therapy is associated with an increase in serum and/or urine levels of
      6-keto-PGF1a and 15-epi-lipoxin A4 in patients with diabetes mellitus type 2.

NCT01042184,Efficacy of 10-day and 14-day Sequential Therapy Versus Triple Therapy on the Eradication of Helicobacter Pylori,"
      Background: Helicobacter pylori infection has been shown to be associated with the
      development of gastric cancer and peptic ulcer diseases. Eradication of H. pylori infection
      could reduce the occurence or recurrence of these diseases. However, the eradication rate of
      clarithromycin-based triple therapy has been declining in recent years, probably related to
      the increasing resistant rate to clarithromycin. It was estimated that 15-20% of patients
      would fail from first line standard eradication therapy and need second line rescue therapy.
      About 15-30% of patient would fail from second line therapy and need to be rescued with third
      line therapy. In recent years, the concept of sequential therapy has been advocated in the
      treatment of H. pylori infection. The regimen includes a PPI plus amoxicillin for five days,
      followed by a PPI plus clarithromycin and tinidazole for another five days. The eradication
      rate in the first line treatment of sequential therapy had been reported to be as high as
      90%. More importantly, it has been demonstrated that the eradication rate among patients with
      clarithromycin-resistant strains could be as high as 89%. However, tinidazole is not
      available in many countries. Whether metronidazole would be an effective alternative to
      tinidazole in the sequential therapy remains unknown. Besides, whether extending the duration
      of sequential therapy from 10-day to 14-day would result in higher eradication rate also
      deserves further investigation. Furthermore, data on the efficacy of rescue regimens for
      patients who failed from first line sequential therapy are also lacking. The impact of
      clarithromycin, metronidazole resistance and CYP2C19 polymorphism on the sequential therapy
      containing metronidazole (rather than tinidazole) also has not been reported.

      Aims: Therefore, we aim to assess

        1. whether the substitution of metronidazole for tinidazole in the sequential therapy is
           also more effective than clarithromycin-based triple therapy

        2. whether extending the duration of sequential therapy from 10-day to 14-day would achieve
           higher eradication rate

        3. whether levofloxacin-based sequential therapy for 14-days is effective as second line
           rescue regimen for those who failed from first line sequential therapy

NCT01048424,Slow Paced-Respiration Intervention to Reduce Incontinence Trial (SPIRIT),"
      Urgency incontinence is a common and burdensome problem in women. Current treatments for this
      condition, while effective, are associated with potentially disabling side effects and high
      rates of discontinuation. There is an urgent need for alternate treatments for urgency
      incontinence that are both clinically effective and well-tolerated by women in the community.

      RESPeRATE is a commercially available ""walkman-like"" device that measures chest/abdominal
      excursion during respiration using an elastic belt with a sensor placed around the torso over
      clothing. The device senses respiration and uses musical tones keyed to inhalation and
      exhalation to help the user slow respiration and prolong exhalation to a recommended goal of
      less than 10 breaths per minute. RESPeRATE is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA) for treatment of mild hypertension, and use of the device has also been shown to
      decrease self-reported anxiety and stress, oxygen consumption, and respiratory rate. Because
      anxiety and stress are strongly associated with urgency incontinence, and common behavioral
      strategies for managing incontinence emphasize relaxation and slow breathing at the time of
      an urgency episode, paced respiration may also be useful in treating urgency incontinence
      and/or decreasing its burden on quality of life.

      We propose to conduct a 6-week pilot randomized controlled trial of slow paced respiration
      using the RESPeRATE device among 30 women with urgency incontinence to assess the feasibility
      of recruiting and teaching women to use the RESPeRATE device as well as to gather preliminary
      data on the efficacy of slow paced respiration for treatment of urgency incontinence and
      related symptoms. Participants will complete a 7-day voiding diary and complete
      questionnaires to measure outcome.

NCT01045551,Open Label Pilot Study of Apremilast in Treatment of Rosacea,"
      Rosacea is a chronic skin disorder with the signs and symptoms of facial flushing, persistent
      redness, small visible spider-like veins, papules (inflamed red bumps under the skin) and
      pustules. Rosacea is also a a recurring skin disorder. In addition to causing uncomfortable
      and embarrassing physical symptoms such as flushing, burning, and itching, rosacea can also
      contribute to lower self-esteem, which can have a significant psychosocial impact on quality
      of life. Rosacea flares can be triggered by every day factors such as sun exposure, heat, hot
      or caffeinated drinks, alcoholic beverages, spices and stress.

      Many of the currently available treatments for rosacea are only partially effective and some
      patients do not respond to them, or are unable to tolerate the side effects.

      This is a single-center, open label trial of Apremilast in ten (10) subjects with moderate to
      severe inflammatory rosacea who will be treated with Apremilast 20 mg twice per day for 12
      weeks. Following the screening period and baseline visit, study subjects will return at weeks
      1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12. There is a follow up study visit at week 16.

      Recent research has shown an increase of specific proinflammatory cytokines in the biopsies
      of inflammatory lesions from rosacea and acne patients. The cytokines then trigger a chain of
      chemical responses in the body that likely result in the development of the papules an
      pustules that are seen in rosacea and acne patients. Apremilast is an oral agent that
      modulates multiple anti-inflammatory pathways and has pharmacodynamic properties with
      potential therapeutic benefit for treating inflammatory autoimmune disorders.

      The investigators therefore propose a pilot study to evaluate the potential for Apremilast to
      improve the signs and symptoms of moderate to severe inflammatory rosacea.

NCT01041495,Cyclobenzaprine Extended Release (ER) for Fibromyalgia,"
      Amrix (Cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride Extended release capsules) is approved by the FDA as a
      muscle relaxant, indicated for the treatment of muscle spasm associated with acute, painful
      musculoskeletal conditions. Cyclobenzaprine ER (Amrix TM) has a distinct pharmacokinetic
      profile providing early systemic exposure and consistent plasma concentration over several
      hours. Overall, a single dose of Amrix 30 mg is similar to that of cyclobenzaprine immediate
      release 10 mg three times daily. This ER formula should improve compliance, with similar
      efficacy and possibly less side effects as is often the case with slower release
      formulations.

      There are clinical studies showing that cyclobenzaprine can alleviate pain secondary to
      Fibromyalgia induced muscle tone. This multi-layered evidence base suggests that
      cyclobenzaprine may be able to alleviate pain in fibromyalgia. Theoretically in fibromyalgia,
      pain is interpreted centrally and possibly occurs due to said muscle spasm . Cyclobenzaprine
      may relieve this pain, thus allowing patients to function better during the day and sleep
      better at night. Cyclobenzaprine has tricyclic antidepressant structure which may also allow
      pain signal dampening in the spinal cord as well, similar to amitriptyline which is used
      off-label for neuropathic pain as well.

      Fibromyalgia (FM) is an illness that may involve medical, rheumatologic, autoimmune, sleep,
      endocrine and psychiatric pathology. It is a syndrome of recurrent pain at trigger points.
      Greater than 90% of these patients will report fatigue as a key symptom as well. There are
      several investigation lines into the treatment of FM induced pain. Exercise, behavioral
      therapy, amitryptiline, duloxetine, tramadol, sodium oxybate, pregabalin all have randomized
      trials and almost all focus on pain. There are very few studies evaluating cyclobenzaprine
      and none studying to Cyclobenzaprine ER formulation. None evaluate pain reduction, sleep and
      fatigue improvement.

      Cyclobenzaprine is a drug with minimal adverse effects (dry mouth, dizziness, fatigue,
      constipation, somnolence, nausea, and dyspepsia). It may have a safer tolerability profile
      than some of the FM medications noted above. As cyclobenzaprine is often studied and often
      added as an augmentation agent to patients' regimens who suffer from acute painful
      musculoskeletal conditions, the authors feel that cyclobenzaprine would also be effective in
      this population. The authors wish to conduct a study to determine if cyclobenzaprine ER is
      safe and tolerable in the treatment of FM induced pain, and secondary fatigue and insomnia.
      This initial study may allow for continued regulatory studies with this product in FM
      subjects. The authors propose a double-blind placebo controlled study to determine if
      cyclobenzaprine ER is safe and effective in reversing FM induced pain, and secondary fatigue
      and insomnia.

NCT01049555,Contribution of Actigraphy and Recognition Video in Apathy Assessment of Alzheimer's Disease : Experimental Research,"
      Neuropsychiatric symptoms form part of the clinical picture of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and
      other dementias. Irrespective of the severity of the disease, the most frequently encountered
      symptom is apathy. Apathy is increasingly diagnosed in patients with neurological and
      psychiatric conditions. Apathy is a disorder of motivation, defined as ""the direction,
      intensity and persistence of goal-directed behaviour"". Most of the current descriptions
      acknowledge this point and consider apathy in terms of a lack of goal-directed behaviour,
      cognition or emotion. The classical neuropsychiatric symptom assessments are subjective
      structured interview-based, using input from the caregiver and/or the patient. New
      technologies are likely to provide us with a more objective measure. An example is ambulatory
      actigraphy, consisting of a piezoelectric accelerometer designed to record arm movement in
      three dimensions.

      The aim of the present study is to assess using actigraphy and video recording signal, AD
      patients with (n = 15) and without (n = 15) apathy and control subjects (n = 5) during an

NCT01042470,Pelvic Floor Study: Biomechanical Properties of the Female Pelvic Floor,"
      Pelvic floor dysfunction in the form of pelvic organ prolapse or urinary and fecal
      incontinence is a sequela for some women who experience injuries during birth. It affects
      adult women of all ages. The life time risk for women by age of 80 years for undergoing
      surgical correction is shown to be 11.1 % , and 29 % of them will undergo re-operation for
      recurrences later on. Still, even today the biomechanics of the pelvic floor is not
      understood enough. The aim of our study is to investigate the biomechanical properties of the
      female pelvic floor, i.e. the vaginal wall, by means of clinical, sonomorphometric
      (ultrasound), histological and elastomechanical examinations. In principle, the
      elasto-mechanical properties of the vaginal wall will be examined by the new and innovative
      so called aspiration device, developed at the Eidgenoessische Technische Hochschule (ETH)
      Zurich, Switzerland. This tool generates a low-pressure of -25 mbar at the vaginal wall,
      aspirating it under visual control by aid of an integrated video camera and therefore
      allowing to measure the difference of its convexity under aspiration and at rest. In case of
      prolapse surgery, this allows us to take a biopsy of the measured vaginal wall and analyze it
      at the Institute of Anatomy at the University of Zurich-Irchel by means of histological (e.g.
      connective tissue, extracellular matrix) and molecular biological examination. With an
      increasing elderly population, more and more women will need surgery for pelvic organ
      prolapse. While effective in restoring anatomy, sometimes by aid of meshes made out of
      polypropylene, the functional outcomes and quality of life are not always restored
      satisfactorily. This interdisciplinary project intends to add a contribution to this for our
      patient still bothersome situation and to help to detect risk factors for developing pelvic
      floor dysfunction.

NCT01050322,Safety Study in Subjects With Metastatic Breast Cancer Who Progressed After Taxanes Treatment.,"
      Despite these initial positive signals in recent statistics, breast cancer continues to claim
      a substantial number of lives approximately 500,000 deaths worldwide in 2005 Thus the current
      treatment paradigm - surgery, radiation and systemic chemo and or hormonal therapy and
      biological therapies -still fails to cure a significant number of women with early breast
      cancer and new treatment strategies are needed to improve current results both in early and
      advance disease.

      Recurrent or metastatic breast cancer is an incurable malignancy with a median survival of
      20-24 months [Hortobagyi , 1998] and this has not changed significantly over the last decade
      with fewer than 20% of patients still alive at 5 years after a diagnosis of recurrence.
      Although there have been small improvements in survival with the new therapies, metastatic
      breast cancer remains an incurable and, ultimately, fatal disease. The introduction of novel
      combination therapies have the potential to target different pathways in the cancer cell,
      leading to improved efficacy. Further studies to optimize combination therapy, while
      ameliorating AEs, are critically important to patients with metastatic breast cancer.

      Lapatinib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor which potently inhibits both EGFR and
      HER2[Spector, 2005]. Lapatinib in combination with capecitabine is approved in more than 20
      countries for the treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer whose
      tumors overexpress HER2. All patients in the study leading to the lapatinib approval had
      received prior therapy including an anthracycline, a taxane, and trastuzumab.

      The relevance of the HER2/neu target in breast cancer, combined with the promising
      preclinical and clinical data regarding the use of lapatinib, provide the rationale for a
      formal evaluation of this agent combined with other non taxane agents as gemcitabine or
      vinorelbine after progression on taxanes and trastuzumab based therapies in metastatic
      disease setting as these chemotherapy options are used in daily practice in this subset of
      patients.

      This is a randomized phase II, open label,multicentric , international, 3 arms treatment
      study in patients with confirmed HER2+ metastatic breast cancer after taxane progression .
      The main objective is to investigate the (CBR) and safety in 3 different combinations of
      Lapatinib therapy (plus capecitabine or gemcitabine or vinorelbine) and to determine whether
      either, or both, of Lapatinib /Vinorelbine or Lapatinib/Gemcitabine can be considered a
      reasonable alternative to the established Lapatinib/Capecitabine standard combination . The
      decision as to whether to study either of the new combinations further will be based on both
      the toxicity and the efficacy profiles.

NCT01050491,Study on the Effects of Sitaxsentan on Airway Remodeling in Patients With Severe Asthma,"
      Introduction. Despite adequate steroid therapy, a subpopulation of approximately 10% of
      asthmatics develops severe persistent airflow obstruction. It is now widely agreed that the
      latter is the consequence of a remodeling process of the airways, characterized by an
      increase in airway smooth muscle mass, mucus gland hypertrophy, increased thickness of the
      subepithelial basement membrane, extracellular matrix protein deposition, angiogenesis,
      fibroblast and myofibroblast accumulation. These phenomena are responsible for airway wall
      thickening and for decreased airway caliber leading to persistent airflow obstruction.

      Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a small peptide, synthesized in the lung by airway epithelial and
      smooth muscle cells, as well as inflammatory cells. ET-1 induces bronchoconstriction,
      mediates eosinophils recruitment during allergic inflammation and contributes to airway
      remodeling by inducing fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells differentiation and proliferation.
      In a recent work from Inserm Unit 700, it has been shown that ET-1 was overexpressed in
      epithelial cells from severe asthmatic patients as compared to patients with less severe
      disease, and that ET-1 expression was strongly correlated with airway obstruction (measured
      by FEV1) and on bronchial biopsies with airway smooth muscle areas. In another study, we have
      shown that a polymorphism of the receptor for ET-1 was strongly associated with the degree of
      airway obstruction in a population of asthmatic patients. All these data suggest that
      inhibition of the ET-1 pathway could be a potential therapeutic option in patients with
      steroids refractory asthma and irreversible airway obstruction. Bosentan, a specific
      inhibitor of ET-1 receptors which is actually used in patients with pulmonary hypertension,
      improves survival and inhibits vascular remodeling.

      Aim and strategy. To study the impact on airway remodeling and clinical status of an
      antagonist of the endothelin receptors (Sitaxentan 100mg/day) over a 12-month period, in a
      prospective randomised placebo-controlled trial involving two parallel groups of 25 severe
      asthmatic patients with irreversible airflow obstruction (FEV1≤ 70% of predicted) . Various
      hallmarks of airway remodeling will be analyzed on bronchial biopsy specimens by
      immunohistochemistry and morphometry. These findings will be correlated with the results of
      pulmonary function tests. Twenty-five patients will be included in each group. Remodeling
      will be measured on bronchial biopsies performed during fiberoptic bronchoscopy at inclusion
      and after one year, by assessing smooth muscle area, submucosal fibroblasts count and
      basement membrane thickness. Every 3 months, bronchial obstruction (FEV1), clinical status,
      asthma exacerbations, steroids use, need for emergency care, asthma symptoms and quality of
      life will be assessed. Evaluation of airway inflammation will be assessed every 3 months by
      exhaled NO and induced sputum cytology.

      This proof of concept study will validate ET-1 as a new molecular target for treating airway
      remodeling in patients with severe asthma.

NCT01052168,Do Motion Metrics Lead to Improved Skill Acquisition on Simulators?,"
      Emphasizing the growing popularity of motion metrics are the majority of available virtual
      reality simulators and some newer hybrid models that offer motion tracking for performance
      assessment. A popular hybrid model (PROMIS) allows training with regular laparoscopic
      instruments in a box-trainer while automatically recording task duration and movement
      efficiency (pathlength and smoothness) that are immediately offered as feedback to trainees.

      Despite the increasing availability of simulators that track motion, our knowledge of the
      impact those metrics have on trainee learning is severely limited. We do not know if it is
      more important to use speed, accuracy, motion efficiency or a combination thereof for
      performance assessment and how these metrics impact skill transfer to the OR.

      Based on sound educational principles we have developed a proficiency-based laparoscopic
      suturing simulator curriculum. This curriculum focuses on deliberate and distributed
      practice, provides trainees with augmented feedback and sets expert-derived performance goals
      based on time and errors. We have previously demonstrated that this curriculum leads to
      improved operative performance of trainees compared to controls.

      To measure operative performance and determine transferability, we will use a live porcine
      Nissen fundoplication model. Instead of placing actual patients at risk, the porcine model is
      preferable for this purpose as it offers objective metrics (targets are established,
      distances measured, knots are disrupted for slippage scoring), complete standardization, and
      allows multiple individuals to be tested on the same day.

      We hypothesize that proficiency-based simulator training in laparoscopic suturing to
      expert-derived levels of speed and motion will result in better operative performance
      compared to participants training to levels of speed or motion alone. The study is powered to
      detect an at least 10% performance difference between the groups.

      Specific Aims

        1. Compare whether any performance differences between the groups persist long-term

        2. Assess whether the groups demonstrate differences in safety in the operating room by
           comparing the inadvertent injuries in the animal OR between the groups

        3. Identify the training duration required by novices to reach proficiency in laparoscopic
           suturing based on speed, motion efficiency, or a combination of these metrics

        4. Identify any baseline participant characteristics that may predict individual
           metric-specific performance

      patients (BMI> 30 kg/m2) in regard of their respective needs for intraoperative fluid therapy
      during laparoscopic surgery.

      Specifically the investigators will test the hypothesis that subcutaneous tissue oxygenation
      (PsqO2)is increased in obese patients when fluid management is optimized by means of
      esophageal Doppler monitoring compared to obese patients undergoing standard fluid
      management.

      Furthermore the investigators will test the hypothesis that PsqO2 is decreased in obese
      patients undergoing conventional fluid therapy compared to non-obese patients when fluid
      management is optimized. Thus the investigators assume that PsqO2 is similar in obese and

NCT01053078,Naltrexone and Hypoglycemia in Type 1 Diabetes,"
      Low blood sugar is also called hypoglycemia. Usually, it is mild and can be treated quickly
      and easily by eating or drinking a small amount of a sugar-rich food. If low blood sugar is
      left untreated, it can get worse and cause confusion, clumsiness or fainting. Severe
      hypoglycemia can lead to seizures, coma, and even death.

      Some people with diabetes do not have early warning signs of low blood sugar. This condition
      is called hypoglycemia unawareness. It happens when the body stops reacting to low blood
      sugar levels and the person does not realize that they need to treat their hypoglycemia. This
      can lead to more severe and dangerous hypoglycemia.

      The purpose of this early study is to see if a drug called naltrexone should be studied more
      in people with Type I diabetes and hypoglycemia unawareness. This study will show whether
      naltrexone could reduce hypoglycemia unawareness. The study will also show, by using magnetic

NCT01054404,Furosemide vs Placebo for Brain Relaxation,"
      Increased brain bulk may be problematic during brain surgery for tumors because it may limit
      surgical exposure and access to the surgical site. Mannitol, an osmotic diuretic, is commonly
      given to alleviate brain bulk, and sometimes furosemide in a small dose is added if mannitol
      alone is insufficient. It is unclear if adding this furosemide truly helps to diminish brain
      bulk, and it is possible that furosemide may cause too much diuresis, leading to dehydration
      and its side effects (e.g., low blood pressure). Our purpose is to investigate what the
      effects of furosemide are in the setting of brain surgery for tumors, specifically with
      regards to decreasing brain bulk and/or causing dehydration.

      Study Hypothesis: The addition of furosemide to mannitol will result in improved brain
      relaxation in human subjects undergoing craniotomy for brain tumor resection than that seen
      with mannitol alone. However, the combination of mannitol and furosemide will also lead to
      more significant intravascular volume depletion than that seen with mannitol alone.

NCT01054508,Effect of Tredaptive on Serum Lipoproteins and Inflammatory Markers,"
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is associated with high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL)
      cholesterol and low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol.

      CVD results from 'hardening of the arteries' when there is a build-up of cholesterol in the
      walls of blood vessels. LDL is the main carrier of cholesterol in the body. LDL particles are
      responsible for transporting cholesterol that is deposited in vessel walls. LDL particles can
      also be altered in structure and turn into an irritant to the vessel walls. The body responds
      to the irritating effect of LDL by producing substances that result in inflammation. This
      sequence of events eventually leads to the vessels becoming permanently damaged. HDL has a
      protective role in CVD. It is associated with the enzyme paraoxonase which protects the body
      from the damaging effects of altered LDL particles.

      Nicotinic acid (niacin) has the ability to lower LDL levels and raise HDL levels thus
      reducing the incidence of CVD. Our study aims to show that niacin not only has good effects
      on cholesterol levels but is also able to reduce inflammation. Niacin is often poorly
      tolerated due to flushing side effect. Tredaptive is a formulation that combines niacin with
      laropiprant, an agent that reduces flushing hence improving tolerability and compliance.

      Patients who are receiving cholesterol-lowering medication and whose LDL levels have not
      reached the recommended target are recruited to the study. The study will be conducted at the
      Manchester Royal Infirmary. The study has two consecutive 16 week periods. In each period
      patients will be randomised to either tredaptive or placebo. They will attend for 5
      monitoring visits. Apart from the first visit, fasting blood samples will be taken from them
      during all subsequent visits.

NCT01056640,Telemonitoring Versus Usual Care,"
      Background: Older adults with multiple chronic illnesses are at risk for worsening functional
      and medical status with ensuing hospitalization. One goal of medical care is to prevent this
      decline. One method that may help slow this functional and medical decline is home
      telemonitoring.

      Specific aim: To determine the effectiveness of home telemonitoring compared to usual care in
      reducing combined outcomes of hospitalization and emergency room visits in an at risk
      population over 60 years of age.

      Materials and Methods: This will be a randomized trial of 200 patients into one of two
      interventions. Home telemonitoring involves the use of a computer device at home which
      records biometric and symptom data from patients. This information is monitored by mid level
      providers associated with the primary care medical practice. Usual care involves patients who
      make appointments with their providers as problems arise and utilize ongoing support like a
      24 hours nurse line. The study participants are adults over 60 years of age within the
      highest 10% on elderly risk assessment (ERA) scores. Patients will have initial evaluations
      of gait, quality of life (SF12), Kokmen test of mental status, and PHQ 9. Patients will be
      followed for 1 year for primary outcomes of hospitalizations and emergency room visits.
      Secondary analysis will include quality of life, compliance with the device and attitudes
      about telemonitoring. Sample size is based upon an 80% power to detect a 36% difference
      between the groups. The primary analysis will involve Cox proportional time to event analysis
      comparing both interventions for telemonitoring or usual care. Secondary analysis will use
      T-test comparisons for continuous variables (quality of life, attitudes) and chi square for
      proportional analysis.

NCT01056744,Optical Coherence Tomography to Evaluate Paclitaxel-Eluting Balloons and Everolimus-Eluting Coronary Stents,"
      Background:

      Safety concerns regarding use of drug eluting stent systems (DES) are related mostly to late
      stent thrombosis, which is facilitated by incomplete stent endothelial coverage. Specific
      information about time course and amount of endothelial strut coverage of different DES is
      required, in order to further refine the concept of antiplatelet therapy after DES
      implantation. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is emerging as a new gold standard for
      endovascular imaging of stents, atherosclerosis progression, vulnerable plaque and neointimal
      proliferation. Very limited OCT data about endothelial coverage of DES are currently
      available. Aim of this study is a comparative evaluation of XIENCE V® everolimus eluting
      stent (Abbot Vascular) and of the bare metal stent (BMS) Coroflex® Blue postdilated with the
      drug-eluting balloon (DEB) SeQuent® Please (paclitaxel-eluting balloon, B. Braun Melsungen
      AG) in terms of endothelial coverage and neointimal proliferation using OCT.

      Study Design:

      A number of 80 patients scheduled for elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with
      a native coronary stenosis suitable for DES implantation and OCT imaging are openly
      randomized 1:1 to either XIENCE V® or Coroflex® Blue/Sequent® Please. The study is
      prospectively conducted at a university high-volume PCI center with OCT expertise (Jena,
      Germany). Angiographic follow-up and OCT imaging with motorized pull-back at 1 mm/s are
      planned in all patients 6 months after implantation of the study stents. OCT endpoints are:
      (1) endothelial coverage, expressed as % of struts without coverage and % of stent length
      containing non-covered struts, and respectively (2) neointimal proliferation, given as %
      neointimal volumetric proliferation within the whole stent and also as focal peak %
      neointimal area proliferation. The study is not powered for clinical endpoints, which are:
      subacute or late stent thrombosis and need for revascularization of the stent segment. Given
      the high number of measurements (15 cross-section images / 1 mm stent length), OCT endpoints
      are likely to reach significance at the level P < 0.05 even at a follow-up drop-out rate up
      to 20%.

NCT01056926,Neurobiology of Nicotine and Non-nicotine Components of Tobacco Addiction,"
      In the present study the investigators will measure the effects of nicotine and non-nicotine
      factors on brain function during cognitive processes that are differentially sensitive to
      these factors. One process-continuous working memory (CWM)-is implemented via a network of
      frontal and parietal brain regions and is highly dopamine dependent. Smoking cessation
      results in significant deficits in CWM which can persist for weeks and are reversed by
      resumption of nicotine administration in the form of smoking or nicotine replacement.
      Additionally, CWM deficits are observed during smoking of denic cigarettes. Brain function
      during CWM is modulated by smoking abstinence and subsequent nicotine administration and
      activity in the dlPFC is implicated in these effects. Collectively, these data suggest that
      CWM is highly sensitive to the nicotine, but not non-nicotine components of smoking. Brain
      function during CWM is altered by smoking abstinence and nicotine, but the effect of smoking,
      in the absence of nicotine, has not been evaluated.

      Another process-cue-reactivity (CR)-results from the repeated pairing of otherwise neutral
      stimuli with nicotine administration. Acute smoking cessation has not been shown to have
      strong effects on CR in the form of cue-provoked craving, nor has nicotine replacement been
      shown to have robust effects on CR. Likewise, the direct effects of smoking abstinence on
      brain CR have been small; though craving has been shown to modulate relations between
      abstinence and CR. Moreover, recent data from our lab suggest larger 'doses' of abstinence (~
      24 hrs) may amplify brain responses to cues. The effect of smoking in the absence of
      nicotine, on CR has not, to our knowledge, been evaluated. Collectively, these data suggest
      that CR in the form of cue-induced craving is not highly sensitive to the effects of
      short-term smoking abstinence or nicotine. Brain CR is modulated by abstinence-induced
      craving and longer-term abstinence, but it is unclear whether abstinence from nicotine or
      non-nicotine components is responsible for these effects.

      In the present study, we propose to evaluate the effects of non-nicotine and nicotine factors
      on CWM and CR using functional magnetic resonance imaging. This method allows for the
      non-invasive assessment of brain function. We will also examine the role of genes in
      moderating and mediating the effects of nicotine and non-nicotine factors on cognitive
      function

      and the ability to perform tasks of daily living such as gardening, carrying groceries, and
      climbing stairs. Health costs associated with aging muscle and bone loss are in the billions
      of dollars. With the projected increase in life expectancy, the incidence of muscle and bone
      loss will rise and further drain the healthcare system, with greater need for
      hospitalization, treatment, and rehabilitation. Without effective strategies to counteract
      aging muscle and bone loss, we may face a healthcare crisis in the future. Creatine, a
      compound found in red meat and seafood, increases creatine phosphate stores in muscle,
      providing increased energy during high-intensity exercise. Short-term (i.e. 3-4 months)
      resistance-exercise and supplementation with creatine, have been shown to have a favorable
      effect on properties of aging muscle and bone. However, the longer-term (i.e. 1 year) effects
      of these interventions are unknown. Therefore, the purpose of this innovative research is to
      determine the longer-term effects of resistance-exercise and creatine supplementation
      (0.1g•kg-1) in older adults. The primary dependent variables to be assessed will include
      muscle hypertrophy, bone mineral and bone geometry, strength, and urinary and blood
      indicators of liver and kidney function. This innovative, multidisciplinary research will
      help contribute to the successful pursuit of prolonged independent living by improving aging
      musculoskeletal health for older Saskatchewan adults. Saskatchewan provides a relevant
      setting for this research, given the higher percentage of older adults (15%), compared to the
      national average (12%).

      We hypothesize that creatine supplementation will increase muscle mass, strength, and bone
      mineral density more than placebo.

NCT01057888,Evaluation of Vaccination Reminder/Recall Systems for Adolescent Patients,"
      The investigators will design and implement a randomized clinical trial to test, on a
      community-wide level, the effectiveness of managed care based tracking/reminder/recall on
      improving vaccination coverage among adolescents.

      The investigators propose a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of
      reminder/recall for adolescents: 10,599 adolescents within the managed care organization
      (MCO) will be randomized into one of three arms: 1) mailed reminders, 2) autodialer telephone
      messages or 3) standard of care of their practice (no messages from the intervention).

      Hypothesis 1: Reminder/recall will increase the receipt of immunizations and preventive
      services

      Hypothesis 2: Telephone (autodialer) reminders will be more effective than mailed reminders

      Hypothesis 3: The impact of reminders will be greatest for the most high-risk subgroups which
      have low baseline immunization rates.

      Hypothesis 4: Mailed reminders will be more costly (and less effective) than telephone
      reminders.

NCT01058239,Bortezomib Plus Rituximab for EBV+ PTLD,"
      Post transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) is a type of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma
      that occurs in patients with weakened immune systems due to immunosuppressive medications
      taken after organ or stem cell transplantation. This is usually related to a virus called
      Epstein-Barr (EPV). Rituximab is a type of drug called an ""antibody"" that specifically
      destroys both normal and cancerous B-cells, and is commonly used for PTLD. Bortezomib is a
      drug that has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat multiple
      myeloma and a B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma called Mantle Cell Lymphoma, and shows significant
      activity in lymphoma cells caused by EBV. In this research study, we hope to learn if the
      addition of bortezomib to rituximab treatment can increase the rate of complete remissions
      and cures of PTLD after organ or stem cell transplant.

      Juvenile onset recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (JORRP) is a rare, difficult to treat,
      benign tumor of the pediatric airway. Current therapy is mainly surgical, but in a
      significant portion of patients adjuvant therapy is required to control the disease process.
      Although multiple adjuvant medical therapies have been tried, success has been limited. We
      have seen some success in a limited amount of patients using orally administered propranolol.
      Our goal is to enroll a larger cohort of patients to determine the effectiveness of
      propranolol as an adjuvant therapy for JORRP.

NCT01058421,Treatment of Critical Illness Polyneuromyopathy,"
      Acute respiratory failure is a heterogeneous disorder that results in more than 300,000
      Americans requiring admission to an intensive care unit for invasive mechanical ventilatory
      support each year. Though acute respiratory failure is a pulmonary disorder, patients who
      survive their hospitalization are not limited by respiratory symptoms after discharge. Rather
      persistent neuromuscular weakness is the primary disorder that adversely alters their quality
      of life and ability to function on a daily basis. In this application the investigators plan
      to conduct a randomized clinical trial called the Do It Now study (Diagnosis and Treatment of
      Neuromuscular Weakness) to determine the effectiveness of an intensive physical therapy
      program for patients recovering from acute respiratory failure. This trial will establish the
      efficacy of the physical therapy programs that is currently performed for patients with acute

      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate a new investigational drug to treat
      neuroblastoma. This study drug is called DFMO. The objectives of this study will be to
      monitor for safety and to find a maximum tolerated dose in this population. A secondary
      objective will be to look at efficacy of DFMO.

      The safety of the proposed dosing regimen in this trial will be tested by an on-going
      risk/benefit assessment during the study. A patient benefiting from treatment, not
      progressing on therapy, and in the absence of any safety issues associated with DFMO and/or
      etoposide may continue on treatment with the expectation that there will be an overall
      clinical benefit.

      The procedures involved in this study include Medical history, Physical exam, Vital signs
      (blood pressure, pulse, temperature), Blood tests, Urine tests, MRI or CT scan of the
      tumor(s), MIBG scans, and Bone marrow aspirations. All of these tests and procedures are
      considered standard of care for this population. Drug administration is also part of this
      protocol, including an investigational new drug called DFMO, and later combined with an
      already approved drug, etoposide.

      The proposed dosing regimen is an oral dose of DFMO two times a day for each day while on
      study. There will be 5 cycles. Each cycle will be 21 days in length. The first cycle will be
      DFMO alone. In the second cycle etoposide will be added in and will be given orally once a
      day for the first 14 days of each cycle (cycles 2-5).

      mutations resulting in a dysfunctional p53 response. Recent studies indicate that the
      tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib acts synergistically with both purine analogies and
      alkylating agents. Also, dasatinib has the potency to restore the apoptotic balance of CLL

      Post operative ileus (POI), a temporary paralysis of the intestines, is a serious health care
      problem. It normally occurs in all patients after surgery to the abdomen but in some cases
      can result in serious complications. The objective of this study is to determine if inhaling
      very low doses of carbon monoxide (CO) before and after colon surgery will shorten the
      duration of normal POI and/or prevent the development of POI complications in patients
      undergoing colon surgery.

      This preliminary study will be conducted in ten healthy volunteers to monitor for blood
      levels and adverse effects that occur at different durations of exposure of inhaled CO to
      establish a safe dose for patients in the main trial. For the main trial, patients requiring
      surgery to their colon will be assigned randomly to receive one hour treatments of either CO
      or oxygen by face mask before and after their operation.

      We hypothesize that healthy volunteers will be able to tolerate 1 hour doses of 250 ppm of CO
      with minimal side effects. It is also anticipated that for each dose of CO administered, the
      blood levels of CO will remain well under poisonous levels. Finally, we anticipate blood

      Background:

        -  Indenoisoquinolines are experimental cancer treatment drugs that damage the DNA in
           cells, resulting in cell death. Researchers have been studying these drugs and their
           usefulness in treating types of cancer that have not responded well to standard
           therapies like surgery or radiation.

        -  LMP400 (NSC 743400) and LMP776 (NSC 725776) are indenoisoquinolines that have not been
           given to cancer patients before. These drugs have very similar chemical structures and
           work the same way, but researchers do not know which one will work best. More
           information is needed about how LMP400 and LMP776 are processed by the body and how
           effective they are in treating difficult-to-treat types of cancer.

      Objectives:

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose of LMP400 (NSC 743400) and LMP776 (NSC 725776).

        -  To study how the body handles LMP400 and LMP776.

        -  To evaluate the effectiveness of LMP400 and LMP776 as a treatment for tumors and
           lymphoma that have not responded to standard treatment.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have malignant solid tumors or Hodgkin s
      disease/non-Hodgkin lymphoma that has not responded to standard therapies.

      Design:

        -  Participants will receive either LMP400 or LMP776. The treatment cycle will be 28 days.
           On the first 5 days of each cycle, participants will receive intravenous doses of their
           specific study drug, followed by 23 days without the drug. The 28-day cycle will be
           repeated as long as the drug does not cause severe side effects and the cancer remains
           stable or improves. The study doctor may increase or decrease the dose of study drug
           depending on how well it is tolerated.

        -  Blood, urine, and hair samples and skin and tumor biopsies will be collected during the
           first treatment cycle. Routine blood samples will be taken throughout the study.

        -  Other tests, including additional blood and urine samples, computed tomography (CT) or
           other scans, and bone marrow samples, may be performed as directed by the study doctors.

      this is due to the meniscus tear per se, the surgery, or whether the development of knee
      osteoarthritis is completely independent of the two. Accordingly, the aim of the study is to
      investigate the effect of arthroscopic partial meniscectomy on the development of knee
      osteoarthritis 2 to 10 years after the procedure.

NCT01052597,Curcumin for Type 2 Diabetic Patients,"
      There are evidence that there is an association between insulin resistance and prolonged
      hyperinsulinemia or hyperglycemia in Type 2 diabetic patients. This will trigger oxidative
      stress system via reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lead to a high level of Nitric oxide.
      This can contribute to a significant change in blood vessel and could end up with the
      complications from cardiovascular disease and increased mortality rate of type 2 diabetic
      patients. The purpose of the present study was to examine the effectiveness of the curcumin
      in type 2 diabetic patients on the reduction of atherosclerosis events by examining

NCT01052740,X-Ray Mammography Standard of Care Protocol,"
      Background:

        -  X-ray mammography is the standard method for breast cancer screening. It is a
           noninvasive test using x-rays to take pictures of breast tissue and detect any
           abnormalities.

        -  The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center has a breast imaging unit that
           has been accredited by the American College of Radiology. To maintain accreditation, the
           unit must recruit a certain number of women to have clinical mammograms each year in
           order to maintain a high level of clinical skills and experience for the radiologists
           and technologists.

      Objectives:

      - To create a state-of-the-art mammography unit at the NIH Clinical Center in order to
      maintain American College of Radiology accreditation of the NIH breast imaging facility.

      Eligibility:

      - Women who are eligible for breast cancer screening because of family cancer history,
      genetic test results, or previous instances of cancer. Participants may not be pregnant or
      nursing at the time of the screening.

      Design:

        -  Participants will provide a brief medical history on arrival at the NIH breast imaging
           unit.

        -  Each participant will have a standard mammogram performed by a radiology technician.

        -  If the study is normal, participants will be told that no further evaluation will be
           performed. If the results indicate a need for further imaging or tissue biopsy,
           participants may elect to return to the care of their primary physician or to receive
           further follow-up at the NIH Clinical Center.

NCT01052974,Perioperative Analgesia by Femoral Perineural Catheter for Femoral Neck Fracture - Study KTcol,"
      Therapeutic essay of phase IV, monocentric, prospective, randomized, in double-blind during
      48 hours(then simple-blind),controlled by placebo.

      Abstract:

      The increasing incidence of the number of femoral neck fractures and the poor prognosis of
      this traumatological pathology involves an optimization of the diagnostic, therapeutic and
      analgesic care.

      A widespread collectively practice for the analgesia in prehospital or preoperative period is
      the single injection (""single shot"") of local anesthetic with the technique of the femoral or
      iliofascial block. Nevertheless the single injection of a dose of local anesthetic associated
      or not with analgesic adjuvants, due to their pharmacological properties, can't prolong the
      efficiency of the loco-regional analgesia more than 12 hours.

      The aim of our study is to evaluate, in the patients admitted in emergencies for suspicion of
      femoral neck fractures, the perioperative efficiency of an analgesic treatment using a
      femoral perineural catheter (inserted from the hospital admission) with continuous infusion
      of ropivacaïne controlled by placebo (physiological serum).

NCT01053325,Establishing Effectiveness of Daily Co-trimoxazole Prophylaxis For Prevention of Malaria in Pregnancy,"
      Malaria is a major contributor of disease burden in Sub-Saharan Africa: 90% of global cases
      occur there, and pregnant women and children under 5 years are the most vulnerable. Malaria
      in pregnancy increases risks of abortion, stillbirth, prematurity, intrauterine growth
      retardation and maternal anemia, and is associated with higher risk of low birth weight and
      perinatal, neonatal and infant mortality. For prevention and control of malaria in pregnancy,
      the WHO recommends Intermittent Preventive Treatment (IPT) with antimalarial drugs,
      insecticide treated nets (ITNs) and effective treatment of malaria and anemia.

      HIV in pregnancy increases the risks of malaria, and it seems that the efficacy of IPT with
      the drug sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is decreased in HIV+ pregnant women.

      Malaria prevention in pregnancy in Zambia relies on ITNs and IPT with SP. Daily prophylaxis
      with cotrimoxazole (CTX) effectively reduces mortality and morbidity in HIV+ individuals, and
      antibiotic therapy during pregnancy might help to decrease adverse pregnancy outcomes. CTX
      prophylaxis improves birth outcomes in HIV+ women with CD4<200/µl: a study concluded that
      antenatal provision of CTX was beneficial for HIV+ pregnant women with low CD4 but not in
      women with ≥200/µl (however, this study was carried out in an area with very low risk of
      malaria , and CTX may have a different effect depending on endemic conditions). The WHO
      recommends daily CTX in addition to ARVs, to prevent opportunistic infections in all HIV+
      patients.

      Concurrent administration of SP and CTX may increase the incidence of severe adverse
      reactions in HIV+ patients, so WHO has promoted CTX prophylaxis as an alternative to SP for
      the IPT in immuno-compromised pregnant women. Unfortunately, there is insufficient
      information on the effectiveness of daily CTX for preventing malaria infection in pregnancy:
      so, SP is still the only antimalarial recommended by WHO for this purpose. With the increase
      in SP resistance and with the newer antimalarials still being studied for safety and efficacy
      in pregnancy, CTX could be an alternative for SP in reducing malaria and malaria-related
      morbidity and mortality in pregnancy.

      This study will try to to see if in HIV- and HIV+ pregnant women, CTX is not inferior to SP
      in reducing placental parasitaemia. Such information is needed to issue updated, effective
      guidelines on malaria prevention in pregnancy

NCT01054638,HIV Treatment and CVD Events,"
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) has been associated with HIV infection. However, it is uncertain
      whether increased CVD rates are associated with HIV-related factors (e.g., HIV-infection or
      highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) may worsen dyslipidemia) or reflect differences
      in the prevalence of underlying risk factors for CVD. Furthermore, the association between
      initiation and duration of HAART exposure and CVD risk, including which specific drugs within
      the HAART classes may contribute to the increased risk, is unknown. The primary objectives of

NCT01055886,Supplemental Nicotine Administration for Smoking Cessation in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD),"
      The investigators propose to evaluate the relationship between PTSD, mood, craving and
      withdrawal symptoms and factors associated with relapse in the context of a randomized
      clinical smoking cessation trial. The use of supplemental nicotine administration (SNA)
      during a ""pre-treatment"" phase before a targeted quit date is an innovative development in
      smoking cessation, and may be helpful in treating smokers with PTSD. The use of SNA during ad
      lib smoking for smokers with PTSD is predicted to reduce both the physiological and emotional
      dependence on inhaled nicotine, thereby increasing the odds of successful smoking cessation.

      Smokers with PTSD will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 pre-cessation patch therapy conditions
      (active patch versus placebo patch) for 2 weeks before a target quit-smoking date. All
      participants will receive brief cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and will begin standard
      nicotine replacement therapy on their quit day. PTSD symptoms, mood, smoking craving and
      withdrawal symptoms will be evaluated using electronic diary assessment for one week prior to
      the pre-cessation period, during the 2-week pre-cessation period, and 6 weeks post quit date.
      The study is designed to address the following aims:

      Specific Aim 1: To examine the effects of SNA on PTSD symptoms, mood, craving and withdrawal
      through electronic diary assessment.

      Hypothesis 1.1. SNA will decrease craving for cigarettes during the 2 week pretreatment
      period as compared to the placebo patch condition.

      Hypothesis 1.2. SNA will decrease the perceived improvement in mood and PTSD symptoms
      associated with smoking behavior.

      Hypothesis 1.3. SNA during the pre-cessation period will result in a reduction of withdrawal
      symptoms following the quit-date.

      Specific Aim 2: To evaluate the effect of SNA on quit rates among smokers with PTSD.

      Hypothesis 2. SNA during the pre-cessation period will result in improved quit rates Specific
      Aim 3: To investigate potential predictors of relapse including PTSD symptom severity, mood,
      anxiety sensitivity, distress tolerance, and self-efficacy.

      Hypothesis 3.1 - 3.5 Increased PTSD symptom severity, increased baseline negative affect,
      increased anxiety sensitivity, decreased distress tolerance, and lower self-efficacy each
      will independently be associated with shorter abstinence from smoking.

NCT01056211,1540nm Non Ablative Fractional Laser Treatment of Scars,"
      Scars are a frequent reason of consultation in a dermatological clinic. Their cosmetic aspect
      can play a key role in patient satisfaction and self-image.

      Non ablative fractional infra-red laser treatment is a new concept in the laser field using
      arrays of microscopic thermal damage patterns to stimulate a wound healing response. There
      are different reports on the positive effect of these type of laser treatment in the
      treatment of acne scarring, striae, rythides, hypopigmented and hypertrophic scars.

      The low morbidity of the treatment and the lack of satisfying treatment regimes for different
      types of scars makes it attractive to investigate the efficacy and safety of 4 treatment with
      the 1540nm non ablative fractional laser in the treatment of scars.

      Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of 4 laser treatments with Starlux 300 Lux 1540nm Fractional
           laser handpiece ( Palomar Medical Technologies ) 1 and 3 month after the last laser
           treatment for 3 different ""scar"" patient groups :

             1. Patients with hypopigmented scars

             2. Patients with hypertrophic scars

        -  To evaluate the treatment related pain. on a categorical scale from 0-10

        -  To evaluate the adverse effect of 1540nm fractional laser versus untreated control in
           the 3 patient groups.

NCT01056887,Copeptin in Differentiation of Polyuria and Polydipsia,"
      The differential diagnosis of patients with polyuria/ polydipsia is often complex, but
      important for the therapeutic strategy.

      Challenging is in particular the clinical differentiation between patients with a partial
      Diabetes insipidus centralis and patients with primary polydipsia as underlying disease,
      because both groups are associated with similar urinary osmolalities.

      The determination of plasma arginine vasopressin is unusual in this context, since
      measurement of AVP is not reliably.

      C-terminal ProVasopressin (copeptin) is secreted stoichiometrically with AVP from the
      neurohypophysis, but has a longer half life in the circulation, and is thus easier to
      measure.

      Therefore, the investigators will analyze in that study the diagnostic utility of plasma
      copeptin in the differential diagnosis of polyuria and polydipsia.

NCT01059188,Neo-adjuvant Treatment in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC),"
      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab, can block tumor growth in different
      ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and
      help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      cisplatin and docetaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by
      killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy
      x-rays to kill tumor cells. Specialized radiation therapy that delivers a high dose of
      radiation directly to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal
      tissue. Giving these treatments before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the
      amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects of giving cetuximab together with
      cisplatin and docetaxel before radiation therapy and cetuximab followed by surgery and to see
      how well it works in treating patients with stage IIIB non-small cell lung cancer that can be

      At a time when there is so much focus in the United States on reducing the cost of health
      care delivery while maximizing the effectiveness of health care performance, Traditional
      Chinese Medicine (acupuncture, herbal treatment, and accessory techniques) offers decision
      makers a tantalizing option. Traditional Chinese Medicine differs from its biomedical
      counterpart in that it is highly portable, inexpensive to administer, relies on a
      conversational diagnostic inquiry system to arrive at differential diagnosis for its
      patients, and has very few reported side effects associated with treatment. The World Health
      Organization cites acupuncture has a proven and effective treatment for 28 diseases/disorders

NCT01059786,Randomized Phase II Trial of Rituximab With Either Pentostatin or Bendamustine for Multiply Relapsed or Refractory Hairy Cell Leukemia,"
      Background:

        -  Researchers are attempting to develop new treatments for hairy cell leukemia (HCL) that
           has not responded well to or has recurred after standard HCL therapies. One nonstandard
           treatment for HCL is rituximab, an antibody that binds to the cancer cells and helps the
           immune system destroy them. By combining rituximab with other anti-cancer drugs,
           researchers hope to determine whether the combined drugs are successful in treating HCL.

        -  Pentostatin and bendamustine are two anti-cancer drugs that have been used to treat
           different kinds of blood and immune system cancers. Bendamustine is approved to treat
           other kinds of leukemia and lymphoma, but it has not been used to treat HCL. Pentostatin
           has been used for more than 20 years to treat HCL, but it has not been combined with
           rituximab in official clinical trials.

      Objectives:

        -  To determine whether rituximab with either pentostatin or bendamustine is a more
           effective treatment for HCL than rituximab alone.

        -  To determine whether pentostatin or bendamustine is a more effective treatment for HCL
           when combined with rituximab.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with hairy cell leukemia that
      has not responded well to or has relapsed after standard HCL therapies.

      Design:

        -  The study will last for four treatment cycles of 28 days each.

        -  Prior to the study, participants will be screened with a full medical history and
           physical exam, bone marrow biopsy (if one has not been performed in the last 6 months),
           computed tomography (CT) or ultrasound scan, tumor measurements, and other tests as
           required by the researchers. Participants will provide blood and urine samples at this
           time as well.

        -  Rituximab with bendamustine: Participants will receive rituximab on Days 1 and 15 of
           each cycle and bendamustine on Days 1 and 2 of each cycle, for a total of four cycles.

        -  Rituximab with pentostatin: Participants will receive rituximab on Days 1 and 15 of each
           cycle and pentostatin on rituximab on Days 1 and 15 of each cycle, for a total of four

NCT01053299,Universal Ultrasound-screening for Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip in Newborn,"
      All newborn from the period 12.1988 to 31.12.2006 During the two last decades, hip ultrasound
      has gained acceptance as an accurate screening test for developmental dysplasia of the hip
      (DDH) and for monitoring the development and treatment of the condition. Debate continues
      over whether DDH that is detected by ultrasonography is necessarily clinically relevant. The
      diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound imaging for DDH in the screening population has not been
      investigated adequately. Studies that investigate the natural course of the disorder, the
      optimal treatment for DDH, and the best strategy for ultrasound screening are needed.
      Ultrasound screening at birth for DDH in all newborn infants is standard practice in some
      European countries but not in the United Kingdom, the United States, or Scandinavia. Evidence
      is insufficient to support or reject general ultrasound screening of newborns for DDH.
      (N.F.Woolacott etc 2006, systematic review BMJ) At Vestre Viken HF, Kongsberg, Norway, the
      investigators implemented universal ultrasound screening in 1998. We will present the long

NCT01051284,A Study of Gemcitabine and Cyberknife Radiation Therapy for Pancreatic Cancer,"
      People with pancreatic cancer that cannot be cured by surgery are being asked to participate
      in this study.

      The purpose of this study is to test the ability of the radiation oncologists to administer
      Cyberknife therapy along with Gemcitabine chemotherapy for patients with pancreatic cancer.
      Radiation and Gemcitabine are both effective at killing cancer cells but they generally
      cannot be given at the same time. Cyberknife therapy is highly focused radiation that is
      being used extensively at Georgetown University and around the United States to treat a
      number of cancers. It is believed that because Cyberknife is so highly focused it can be
      given safely with regular doses of chemotherapy to attack cancer cells in two ways at the
      same time.

      This research is being done because it is not known if using Cyberknife with chemotherapy
      will be a safe way to treat pancreatic cancer.

      Type 2 diabetes is a major public health problem in India with an estimated a prevalence of
      approximately 4% and 12% in rural and urban areas respectively. Accumulating evidence
      suggests that serum cholecalciferol levels may be inversely related to the prevalence of

NCT01053182,Esophagectomy Associated Respiratory Complications: Ivor-Lewis Versus Sweet Approaches,"
      Worldwide, esophageal cancer is the 6th most common cause of cancer-related death. Currently
      curative resection remains the cornerstone of the therapy. Despite advances in anesthesia,
      operative techniques and postoperative management, postoperative pulmonary complications
      (PPCs) occur frequently accounting for about 30% of all postoperative complications. Most
      importantly, PPCs have much been associated with postoperative mortality. The diaphragm is
      the most important respiratory muscle and its respiratory function would be inevitably
      damaged when esophagectomy is performed through the left posterolateral thoracotomy (Sweet
      procedure) because the diaphragm must be dissected for the purpose of stomach moralization.
      Meanwhile, Ivor-Lewis approach may effectively avoid diaphragm injury because the stomach can
      be managed through a laparotomy whereas an additional abdomen incision is needed. Both
      procedures are routinely used in practice when surgically managing esophageal cancer. The
      investigators hypothesize that Ivor-Lewis procedure might be superior to the left-thoracotomy
      route during esophagectomy in preventing PPCs.

      patients with hip fracture will be developed and implemented, then, the effectiveness of the
      intervention program will be examined. The specific aims are as follows:

        1. To develop a well conceived and feasible protocol of hospital discharge and sub-acute
           care that involves the coordinated work of health care professionals (physicians,
           surgeons, nurses, and physical therapists) and the informal caregivers. The feasibility
           of implementing such a protocol within the context of an intervention study subject to
           the constraints of the clinical setting (i.e., CGMH) will be evaluated in a pilot study.

        2. To conduct a randomized clinical trial to evaluate the outcomes and costs associated
           with the proposed hospital discharge/sub-acute care protocol for elderly patients with
           hip fracture. Both experimental and case study methods will be used. Information on

      Each year around 200 blood donors in the UK are found to be infected with blood-borne
      diseases (HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HTLV), while several others have been identified
      as having an increased risk of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD). Although the
      notification procedures for these infections vary, their effectiveness and appropriateness
      have never been evaluated in a systematic study.

      The proposed research has been designed to assess the responses of blood donors to
      notification and their satisfaction with how they were informed about the infection. The
      study will be implemented using standard questionnaire-based measures (French et al, 2004;
      Marteau & Bekker, 1992).

      The study will involve approximately 600 blood donors who were informed of an infection or
      possible infection with blood-borne diseases in 2008 and 2009, and approximately 100 donors
      notified of possible risk of vCJD infection in 2005. A comparable group of 2005 donors will
      be included to control for the effects of time. As the majority of donors testing positive
      donated to NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT), the participants will be identified from the
      NHSBT database only, and their availability confirmed through their GP or specialist
      clinician. A standardized questionnaire will be then sent to all those identified as
      eligible.

      The study will last 12 months, but direct participant involvement will be limited to the time
      required to complete the questionnaire, which should take under one hour. To safeguard
      confidentiality, no identifiable personal data will be used in the analysis. Where
      demographic or medical information already held by NHSBT is retrieved to minimise response
      burden, this will be pseudonymised before use.

      Overactive bladder is a condition associated with symptoms of feeling the urge to urinate,
      urinating often, and may or may not be accompanied by leakage of urine. A patient who has a
      spinal cord injury (SCI) often suffers from an overactive bladder which often leads to
      urinary incontinence (UI - an unwanted leakage of urine).

      OnaBoNT-A bladder injections have been studied in clinical research trials. The results have
      shown an improvement in urinary symptoms by reducing how often urine leakage occurs and by
      increasing the amount of urine the bladder can hold.

      This purpose of this clinical trial is to see if onaBoNT-A is safe and effective when
      injected into the bladder for the treatment of UI and if it works better than a drug that is
      taken by mouth. A second purpose of the study is to perform research tests on the urine
      samples provided by the volunteers. Urine presents a rich source of information for bladder
      diseases and the biomarkers (the chemical make-up of the urine cells) will be examined to
      learn if there are yet undiscovered reasons for urinary diseases. These tests would be very
      beneficial because the results would lead to better treatment of the urinary diseases.

NCT01052038,Post Operative Sore Throat and Dexamethasone,"
      Sore throat is a common postoperative complaint that can lead to morbidity and patient
      dissatisfaction . The incidence of sore throat has been reported to be between 6% and 90%
      even under optimal intubating conditions. There are several factors that have been shown to
      contribute to postoperative sore throat such as patient related factors, type of anesthesia
      and type of surgery.

      Corticosteroids are also commonly used in the perioperative period to potentiate analgesics
      and as antiemetics. The preoperative administration of dexamethasone can decrease the
      incidence and severity of postoperative sore throat which is rated by patients as one of the
      most undesirable outcomes in the postoperative period.

NCT01056016,Disseminating a Model Intervention to Promote Improved Attention-deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Care in the Community,"
      The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has established a set of consensus guidelines for
      pediatricians to follow. These guidelines can be challenging to implement in typical
      community-based practices. Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) has
      developed a program called the ADHD Collaborative to promote the adoption of these guidelines
      among community pediatricians. The program focuses on modifying the office system using
      academic detailing and quality improvement (QI) methodology to accommodate prescribed
      practice changes. The ADHD Collaborative has been very successful at recruiting practices in
      the Greater Cincinnati area, changing practice behaviors, and sustaining these practice
      behaviors over time at minimal cost to the project and to the office practice. Now that
      sustainability and effectiveness have been established, the next step is to modify the ADHD
      Collaborative model to make it amenable to widespread dissemination. The primary goal of the
      proposed study is to modify the ADHD Collaborative intervention to make it transportable and
      then evaluate this version in terms of effectiveness, consumer satisfaction, and costs.. A
      transportable intervention is described that utilizes telehealth videoconferencing, a web
      portal, and long-distance data collection. Initially, three pediatric practices will be
      recruited to test and refine the distal intervention delivery methodology. Then, eight new
      pediatric practices will be randomly assigned to receive the distal intervention or to a
      control group (treatment as usual). Information about pediatric practice behavior will be
      collected at baseline, 6-months, and 1-year post-baseline. The study design will allow for a
      preliminary assessment of the feasibility and effectiveness of the distal intervention in
      terms of rates of evidence-based practice behaviors to patients, change in pediatrician
      attitudes, consumer satisfaction, and costs.

NCT01056406,Nutrition Intervention for the Promotion of Healthy Weight Gain During Pregnancy,"
      The purpose of this study is to determine if twice monthly interaction with a registered
      dietitian from 6-16 weeks gestation through 6 months postpartum will help women who are
      overweight or obese gain weight during pregnancy closer to the Institute of Medicine
      (IOM)guidelines and lose weight more effectively within the 6 month postpartum period than
      those who do not receive twice monthly interaction with a registered dietitian during this
      period.

      Overweight/obesity can lead to a number of adverse pregnancy, delivery and birth outcomes,
      including increased risk of hypertension, eclampsia, and diabetes during pregnancy,
      miscarriage, premature delivery, birth injuries, neural tube defects, and prenatal death.
      More than half of women of childbearing age are overweight or are obese. Women of color and
      low-income women are affected disproportionately.

      Unfortunately, women know little, if anything, about the impact of overweight and obesity on
      pregnancy and health care providers are unsure how to effectively address the problem with
      their patients.

      A limited number of programs have tested ways to effectively address weight gain management
      during pregnancy. None have been successful in addressing weight gain in women who are obese
      or overweight at the start of pregnancy. The 2-year Revere Health Center Pregnancy Weight
      Management Study will test the feasibility and efficacy of providing pregnant women who are
      overweight or obese with regular access to a registered dietitian during and after pregnancy
      to help achieve total weight gain closer to recommended guidelines and to ensure the best

      The purpose of this study is to apply a recently developed screening test for dementia, the
      Memory Orientation Screening Test (MOST) to two additional groups. Group one is composed of
      150 elders who do not have dementia and are residing in the community so that we can
      determine what is a ""normal"" MOST score. These subjects will also be individually
      administered a one-hour battery composed of other commonly used tests of memory and
      information processing. Group two is composed of 150 elders who are administered the MOST by
      a nurse as part of their regular visit to the primary care doctor's office, and their scores
      will be compared against a rating of their cognitive ability made independently by the doctor
      or another nurse. Their scores will also be compared with a list of their medical problems
      and medications. Our hypothesis for the first group is that the MOST scores will be higher in
      the normal group than in the previous clinical groups and that MOST scores will correlate
      significantly with other neurocognitive tests. Our hypothesis for the second group is that
      the MOST can be administered quickly and easily by briefly trained nurses, that it will
      compare highly with doctor opinions, and that patients with known medical conditions related
      to dementia, such as hypertension or diabetes, will have lower MOST scores than patients in

NCT01057641,Study on the Treatment of Degenerative Lumbar Spine Stenosis With a Percutaneous Interspinous Implant,"
      Neurogenic intermittent claudication is a specific symptom complex occurring in patients with
      lumbar spinal stenosis. Characteristic of this disease is the occurrence of increasing leg,
      buttock or groin pain with or without lower back pain when walking a certain distance or
      reclining. Bending forward or sitting leads to a rapid pain relief. Lumbar spinal stenosis is
      defined as a reduction of the diameter of the spinal canal. The mechanism leading to stenosis
      is a remodeling and overgrowth of the spinal canal with osteophyte formation. Any loss of
      tissue or decrease of the disc height results in a relative laxity of the ligament structures
      and accelerates the degeneration of the spinal joints. As a therapy option, conservative
      therapy with oral analgesics and physical therapy is considered. This treatment can be
      intensified by adding epidural pain treatment. Is the conservative treatment not successful
      surgical intervention is necessary. In patients over 65 years of age operative decompression
      of the lumbar spinal stenosis constitutes the most common surgical operation of the spine. A
      relatively new therapy alternative is the interspinous process decompression (IPD). Studies
      have shown that the IPDs prevent narrowing of the spinal canal and neural foramens. The study
      is intended as a randomised, monocentre study to investigate the safety and the benefit of a
      minimally invasive percutaneous IPD-device in comparison with the best non-surgical operative

NCT01057953,Oligogenic Determinism of Colorectal Cancer,"
      The majority of the clinical situations suggestive of an increased genetic risk for
      colorectal cancer (CRC) are not explained by a simple monogenic model. Our working hypothesis
      is that a fraction of clinical conditions suggestive of an increased genetic risk for CRC
      (familial aggregation, early age of tumour onset, development of multiple primary CRC) is due
      to the combination of a limited number of genetic variations, each conferring a moderate risk
      for CRC, but whose combination results into high risk.

      This study, which will be both retrospective and prospective, is an association study that
      will compare frequencies of selected genetic variations, alone or in combination, between
      patients (cases) whose clinical presentation is suggestive of an increased genetic risk but
      who do not present a known Mendelian form of CRC, and controls, in order to assess
      associations of these variations with non-Mendelian genetic forms of CRC. The inclusion
      criteria will be: CRC in two first degree relatives, one being diagnosed before 61 years of
      age; or CRC diagnosed before 51 years of age or advanced colorectal adenoma before 41 years
      of age; or multiple primary CRCs in the same individual, the first being diagnosed before 61
      years of age The exclusion criteria will be: Lynch syndrome, adenomatous polyposis and
      hamartomatous polyposis. The genetic variations which will be analyzed will include (i) SNPs
      detected by GWAS and associated to CRC. (ii) Risk factors corresponding to functional
      polymorphisms within candidate genes. (iii) Imbalance of the TGFbR1 allelic expression.
      Sample sizes were calculated to obtain 80% power for an odds ratio of 2.5 since the aim of
      this study is to determine genetic variations conferring a moderate risk. In order to cover
      all these possibilities and to have reasonable even for the genetic variations with low
      frequency below 0.03 or high frequency above 0.90, the target sample size was set at 700
      cases and 350 controls. The recruitment of patients will be performed at the national level
      by the cancer genetics departments ensuring a correct evaluation of the personal and familial

NCT01058356,Effect of Probiotic Lactobacilli (Lacidofil Cap®) for the Prevention of Antibiotic-Associated Diarrhea,"
      Antibiotic-Associated Diarrhea (AAD) is a common complication of antibiotic use. The
      frequency of AAD can be high (26 - 60%) or moderate (13-29%) during hospital outbreaks and is
      relatively infrequent in outpatients. The risk factors for AAD include broad-spectrum
      antibiotics, host factors (age, health status, and gender), hospitalization period and
      exposure to nosocomial pathogens. AAD occurs 2-8 weeks after exposure to antibiotics as a
      result of disrupting normal intestinal microflora. One of the roles of normal intestinal
      microflora is to act as a protective barrier that resists the colonization of intestinal
      pathogens. These patients are susceptible to infection by opportunistic pathogens without
      this protective barrier. Probiotic therapy is suited to AAD and Clostridium difficile
      disease. Probiotics assist in reestablishing the disrupted intestinal microflora, enhancing
      immune responses and clearing pathogens and their toxins from the host. Studies using
      probiotics have been reported for the past twenty-eight years (1977~2005), but the studies
      have been variable in trial designs and types of probiotics, had differing doses and
      durations of treatment, and thus have yielded controversial results. The investigators will
      conduct a multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial to assess the
      efficacy of the probiotic Lactobacilli (Lacidofil cap®) for the prevention of AAD in adults.

      Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is a common disorder in children (2-3%). OSAS in
      turn, is associated with significant behavioral, learning, and heart problems.
      Adenotonsillectomy (T&A, meaning the removal of tonsils and adenoids) is the most common
      treatment for the problem .Diagnosis of OSAS in children is based on overnight
      polysomnography (sleep study). Recent studies suggest that upper airway and systemic
      inflammatory changes exists in school-age children and adults with OSAS, and that anti
      inflammatory therapy can improve respiratory parameters during sleep and reduce adenoid size,
      similar to surgery. However, there are no data in the literature on inflammatory changes in
      infants with the disorder.

      Healthcare resources utilization, a sensitive marker for diseases is consumed by young
      children (<3y) with OSAS more then healthy children, from their first year of life We
      hypothesize that infants and young children with OSAS present local inflammatory changes of
      the airways as well as systemic inflammation (in the blood or urine) that contribute to the
      learning, growing and heart associated medical problems. The Aims of the present study are to
      characterize the local and systemic inflammatory changes of young children with OSAS, and to
      evaluate their associated medical problems at diagnosis and after therapy (T&A) If indeed
      inflammation is ""responsible"" for the development of OSAS at such a young age it should be
      reduced following therapy (i.e. T&A). In such a case bio-markers may become a part of the
      algorithms for diagnosis and follow up of such patients.

        -  The investigators conducted a prospective, randomised, controlled trial to investigate
           the efficacy and safety of a semi-automatic response system (SARS) for online glucose
           monitoring over a 24-week period of patients with type 2 diabetes. In the SARS group,
           the ""SARS"" software filtered the recorded self-monitoring of blood glucose data
           automatically to reduce the physicians' time, and the physicians managed patients
           regularly but only manually in the control (manual) group. The investigators measured

NCT01058798,The Role of Glycosyltransferases in the Oncogenesis of Neuroblastoma,"
      Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common malignant tumor of infancy. Approximately 60% of NB
      patients are clinically diagnosed as the stage IV disease and have a very poor prognosis with
      a 5-year survival rate of no more than 30%. The mechanism underlying the tumorigenesis of NB
      remains largely unclear. It has been suggested that the pathogenesis of NB is due to a
      failure of differentiation or apoptosis of the embryonic NB cells.

      Well-regulated glycosylation is essential for the normal development of the nervous system.
      Altered expression of glycosyltransferases with resulting dysregulated glycosylation of
      neuroblastic cells might lead to the development of NB. The
      β1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase III (B4GALNT3) exhibits GalNAc transferase activity to
      form the GalNAcβ1,4GlcNAc (LacdiNAc or LDN) structure. The Drosophila B4GALNTA, homolog of
      human B4GALNT3, has been suggested to regulate the neuronal development. By
      immunohistochemical studies, we demonstrated that the expression of B4GALNT3 correlated well
      with histological grade of differentiation in 87 NB tumor samples. In addition, positive
      B4GALNT3 expression predicted a favorable patient's outcome. These evidences suggest that the
      regulation of glycosyltransferases is critical for the development of NB.

      To further explore the role of glycosyltransferases in the differentiation and development of
      NB, we propose a 3-year project with the following 3 major aims:

      Aim Ⅰ: Clarifying the effects of B4GALNT3 on NB cell behavior in vitro and in vivo. For
      further understanding the effects of B4GALNT3 on NB cells, NB cells with stable
      overexpression of B4GALNT3 are to be selected. Then NB cell phenotype and behavior changes
      after overexpression of B4GALNT3 are evaluated by in vitro assays as well as by a nude mice
      xenograft model. In addition, the expression of B4GALNT3 will be suppressed by siRNA, then
      the response of NB cells to ATRA-induced differentiation is evaluated.

      Aim Ⅱ: Clarifying the target proteins glycosylated by B4GALNT3 as well as their associated
      downstream pathways in vitro and in vivo. The possible proteins glycosylated by B4GALNT3 are
      evaluated by comparing differential protein expressions between B4GALNT3-transfected and
      mock-transfected NB cells using proteomics analysis. NB tumor samples with low and high
      B4GALNT3 expression levels are also subjected to proteomics analysis to explore the possible
      target proteins glycosylated by B4GALNT3 in vivo. After identifying the target proteins
      modified by B4GALNT3, the downstream pathways to affect NB cell differentiation will also be
      evaluated.

      Aim Ⅲ: Clarifying whether B4GALNT4, a family member of B4GALNT, plays a similar role as
      B4GALNT3, as well as how the expression of these enzymes are controlled epigenetically in
      human NB cell lines and tumor samples. The expression levels of B4GALNT4 in human NB samples
      are evaluated by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. The methylation status of the promoter
      sites of both B4GALNT3 and B4GALNT4 are examined in various NB cell lines as well tumor
      samples. Furthermore, NB tumor samples exhibiting high and low B4GALNT levels are subjected
      to microRNA array.

      Altogether, our studies will not only establish the functional role of the family of
      glycosyltransferases in the cell behavior of NB, but also illustrate how the expression of
      glycosyltransferases are regulated epigenetically and how the glycosyltransferases affect NB
      cell behavior. Therefore, our results might shed light to the oncogenesis of NB as well as
      target therapy of NB.

NCT01058876,Comparison of Low Yield Cigarettes in African Americans vs. Whites,"
      The investigators' general hypothesis is that African-Americans (AAs) smoke more for positive
      reinforcement from nicotine with a ""peak-seeking"" pattern of smoking (smoking individual
      cigarettes more intensively with greater intake of nicotine and tobacco smoke toxins), while
      whites smoke more for negative reinforcement with a ""trough-maintaining"" pattern (avoiding
      withdrawal by maintaining more consistent nicotine levels throughout the day by means of a
      more regular smoking pattern). We, the investigators, believe that these patterns are linked
      to identifiable racial differences in nicotine pharmacology.

      For this study we hypothesize that if AAs behave more like nicotine ""peak-seeker"" while
      whites behave more like nicotine ""trough-maintainers"", that AAs will respond to switching
      from regular to low nicotine yield commercial cigarettes by smoking each cigarette relatively
      more intensively with a relatively smaller increase in daily cigarette consumption
      (cigarettes per day or CPD) as compared to whites.

NCT01058980,ADenosine Following Pulmonary Vein Isolation to Target Dormant Conduction Elimination: the ADVICE Trial,"
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common heart rhythm disorder, impairs quality of life
      and increases stroke risk and mortality. Despite advances in medical treatment, AF remains
      uncontrolled in many patients. In many patients, AF is initiated by abnormal electrical
      impulses from the pulmonary veins. A catheter ablation procedure called pulmonary vein
      isolation (PVI) has therefore been developed, using heat to isolate the PV foci from the
      heart. PVI is very effective, but must be repeated in up to 50% of cases because the foci
      isolation is not permanent after initial PVI. The intravenous administration of a drug called
      adenosine during the PVI procedure can unmask residual conduction that would otherwise remain
      unnoticed, so-called ""dormant conduction"". In our experience, additional ablation guided by
      adenosine reduces AF recurrence and the need for a repeat PVI procedure. However, the
      adenosine-guided approach has not yet been proven as standard therapy. The present study, to
      be conducted at 15 clinical centres in Canada, Europe and Australia is therefore intended to
      evaluate the efficacy of adenosine-guided ablation to prevent AF recurrence. Five hundred
      twenty-six patients will be included in the study, which should be completed within 2 years.
      In all patients, the presence of dormant conduction will be tested with adenosine during PVI.
      If dormant conduction is observed, additional ablation will be performed in half of these
      patients selected randomly. If there is no dormant conduction, randomly selected patients
      will be followed in a registry. If the adenosine-guided approach is demonstrated to improve
      the success rate of PVI procedures, it should become the standard approach for a ""permanent
      cure"" of AF, and therefore benefit patients by reducing arrhythmia recurrence,
      hospitalizations and the need for repeat interventions.

NCT01059032,Enhancement and Restoring of Low Dose Abdominal CT Images,"
      Through the rapid growth of multislice Computer Tomography (CT) imaging, radiation protection
      has become a major issue in the radiological community. Optimizing CT scanning is a key task
      when keeping the radiation doses as low as reasonable achievable (the ALARA principle). Post
      processing filters can improve and restore grainy and noisy low dose CT images by enhancing
      structure and reducing image noise. In our study of 10 patients, the investigators perform a
      preliminary evaluation of a novel post processing filter, which does picture element
      correlations in all three spatial dimensions. By comparing normal dose pictures with
      unprocessed low-dose pictures and pictures processed with two dimentional (2D) and three
      dimentional (3D) filters,the investigators will be able to assess the possible clinical value
      of the 3D filter. This project is collaboration between Buskerud Hospital (BU), Buskerud

      This is a pilot study funded by the National Institutes of Health. In this project, we will
      investigate the potential effect of skeletal muscle nitric oxide (NO) production on muscle
      strength and physical function in older individuals. We propose to test a new method that may
      enable simultaneous determination of both vascular and skeletal muscle NO production for the
      first time in humans. Further, we will determine whether augmentation of NO-mediated
      responses, by administration of sildenafil citrate (Viagra), reduces fatigue and fatigability
      in older individuals.

NCT01051505,"A Study to Assess the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics (PK) and Pharmacodynamics (PD) of Multiple Ascending Doses of AZD5069 in Healthy Volunteers","
      The purpose of this study is to explore the safety and tolerability of AZD5069 at
      steady-state, following twice a day oral dosing in healthy subjects.

      AZD5069 is being developed by AstraZeneca and this study is being carried out on behalf of
      the sponsor by Quintiles Drug Research Unit at Guy's Hospital, London. This is the second
      time that AZD5069 will be administered to humans in clinical trials. We are conducting this
      study to determine whether AZD5069 is safe and well tolerated by healthy males and females at
      different dose levels over an 8-day dosing period. We will also be studying how quickly
      AZD5069 is absorbed into and cleared by the body. It is planned that there will be up to 3
      dose groups in the study and each group will consist of up to 12 volunteers, with 9 receiving
      the active drug and 3 receiving placebo. The study involves 3 visits over approximately 8
      weeks, and will include 1 residential visit lasting 10 nights and a follow up.

NCT01052376,Endomicrocancer: Confocal Endomicroscopy in Patients With High Risk of Colorectal Cancer,"
      The principle objective of this study is to validate confocal endomicroscopy (CEM) in a
      national, multicenter study, in terms of its ability to diagnose neoplastic lesions in vivo,
      in two groups of patients at high risk of colorectal cancer (CRC): patients with familial
      adenomatous polyposis (FAP) after colectomy in whom the neoplastic lesions are probably
      under-diagnosed, and patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) in whom endoscopic
      surveillance is particularly difficult. Methods: The study will be comprised of two phases
      (Phase I and II). Phase I will serve to validate at the multicenter level the results of the
      first, recently published, monocenter German study in terms of capacity of CEM to identify
      the colonic neoplastic lesions in vivo. Phase II is destined to prospectively evaluate the
      diagnostic yield of CEM in detection and prediction of neoplastic lesions by developing and
      adding new features to the confocal pattern of in vivo diagnosis. Two cohorts of patients
      will be studied in parallel: Patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), like ulcerative
      colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD), including those before planned colectomy, and patients
      with FAP after colectomy. During lower endoscopy performed under general anaesthesia, each
      colonic segment will be examined before and after staining with indigo-carmin. After
      intra-venous fluorescein injection, all macroscopically abnormal lesions will be examined by
      CEM, then biopsied. In parallel, multiple random biopsies will be performed, each coupled
      with simultaneous CEM ""optical biopsy"" at the same point. In addition, during Phase II, in
      IBD patients before planned colectomy and in patients with FAP, a ""mapping"" of colonic
      mucosa, by obtaining a very high number of CEM ""optical biopsies"", will be performed, and
      will be correlated with standard histology performed either on colectomy specimens (IBD) or
      on standard biopsies (FAP). Principal analysis (Phase I and II) will include evaluation of
      inter-observer variation in terms of interpretation of in vivo histology and diagnostic yield
      of CEM with respect to the detection of neoplastic lesions by evaluation of sensitivity and
      specificity, using standard histology as reference method. Additional analysis (Phase II)
      will be performed to evaluate the diagnostic and predictive (CRC risk) value of ""colonic
      mapping"" by correlating optical images pattern score to results of standard histology.
      Expected results: This study should guarantee high quality data, standardization of
      procedures and of interpretation of CEM images, which are prerequisite for dissemination of
      CEM in clinical practice. The investigators expect to show that CME allows to reliably
      discriminate between neoplastic and non-neoplastic lesions, that, compared to standard
      histology, provides better characterization of lesions, especially in the context of extended
      lesions like in IBD, an finally, that CME images can be used to develop a new ""optical
      biopsy""-based score allowing prediction of high CRC risk in patients with FAP and IBD. The
      investigators believe that CEM may increase, as compared to currently used techniques, the
      diagnostic yield in terms of probability of the detection of neoplastic lesions in patients
      at high risk of CCR, and may become a new standard for endoscopic surveillance in these
      patients.

NCT01054612,Tissue Sectioning by Electro-Dissociation,"
      Currently there is no technique to produce thin (0.004-0.01 mm) serial sections of large
      fresh tissue specimens that are suitable for high-resolution in situ protein/gene expression
      studies without ice artifact or fixation-induced molecular damage. Traditional frozen
      sectioning preserves protein and nucleic acid structure, but the inherent ice artifact
      precludes reconstruction of protein and mRNA expression patterns in 3-dimensions. Since the
      limitations of the existing sectioning techniques result from the fact that they rely on
      mechanical cutting which in turn require the tissue to be stiff, we suggest a new approach to
      cut tissue via an electro erosion process that utilizes focus radio frequency (RF).

      In this particular study the physicians want to use a new technique of how they obtain the
      PET/CT pictures. It is called breath-hold (BH) PET/CT"". As the name suggests, they will ask
      the patient to hold their breath for about 20-30 seconds, and only during that time will they
      obtain pictures. This is repeated several times. In contrast to the standard PET/CT scan,
      they expect less ""blurring"" of the pictures, so that they can see the tumor better and
      measure the uptake of radioactive sugar in the tumor better and more reliably. Basically,
      this is the difference between taking pictures of a runner as compared to taking pictures of
      a person standing still. Since PET images need to be obtained over several minutes and people
      can not hold their breath for this extended time, we break the procedure into several cycles
      of 20-30 seconds (or longer, if possible) and then add all the ""frozen"" pictures in the end
      into one. They want to know if BH PET/CT scan measure changes in the cancer during therapy

      The growing population of University of Nebraska Medical Center patients with heart failure
      combined with the increasing number of surgical procedures performed each year supports the
      need for a critical analysis of how to most appropriately manage these patients during the
      perioperative period, especially for non-cardiac surgery. Echo-guided hemodynamic management
      (EGHEM) is the use of echocardiography data to normalize and/or optimize in real-time,
      cardiac output and ventricular filling pressures in the perioperative period for non-cardiac
      surgical cases. The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that EGHEM compared to
      standard management practices will result in a reduced length of hospital stay in the
      noncardiac surgery population. The primary goal of health care providers for patients
      requiring anesthetic care, perioperative care, or critical care is ensuring the adequacy of
      the patient's circulatory function by optimizing cardiac output and ventricular filling
      pressure. Currently, the use of the ECG monitor and systemic blood pressure are the standard
      of care for assessing circulatory function. However, those data cannot provide accurate
      information on cardiac output and ventricular filling pressure for patients with
      cardiovascular risk factors and/or comorbidities. As a result, managing the hemodynamic
      parameters of these patients, as well as their intravenous fluid needs and resuscitation
      strategy, we hypothesize that using traditional approaches may lead to significant volume
      overload and post-operative cardiovascular complications and morbidity. In this study we
      propose an EGHEM strategy that incorporates standard echocardiography generated data points
      in addition to the systemic blood pressure and ECG signal to assess, manage, modify and
      optimize patient cardiac preload, afterload, heart rate and contractility in the
      perioperative period. Based on our initial observations and preliminary data using the EGHEM
      approach, we hypothesize that we can demonstrate a significant decrease in hospital length of
      stay and an overall decrease in perioperative morbidity at 30 days in the non-cardiac surgery
      population using EGHEM compared to standard practices. In this proposal we have designed a
      single center, prospective, randomized clinical trial to test our hypothesis.

NCT01050673,Trial of Versajet Compared With Conventional Treatment in Acute and Chronic Wounds,"
      It is increasingly recognised that the debridement of devitalised, bacterially contaminated
      or senescent tissue is an essential component of the effective treatment of delayed healing
      wounds.

      Whilst surgical debridement procedures have conventionally been performed with scalpels and
      other sharp instrumentation, alternative techniques such as the VERSAJET Hydrosurgery System
      are becoming more widespread.

      To increase the adoption of this new technology, it is essential that clinical improvements
      are assessed alongside the potential impact on the costs of debridement and the net financial
      impact on the hospital.

      It is hypothesised that a decrease in the time to achieve stable wound closure will not only
      lead to a patient benefit, but also a potential reduction in the cost of treatment due to
      e.g. repeat procedures, longer hospital stay, infection etc. The purpose of this study is to

NCT01053754,Optimization of the Evaluation of the Adrenal Function After Discontinuation of a Prolonged Therapy With Corticosteroids,"
      The study (forward-looking and opened) will concern 70 subjects having had a systemic
      prolonged treatment with corticosteroids for intestinal chronic inflammatory disease,
      recruited in the services of gastroenterology and endocrinology of the North Hospital of
      Marseille (France). The primary objective of the study is to estimate a new test, the ""long""
      synacthen stimulation test, using an IM injection of 1 mg of delate synacthen, with regard to
      the definitive standard. Indeed, this long test could be realized in ambulatory conditions,
      and turn out more contributory than the definitive standard to estimate the capacities of
      answer of the adrenal glands in front of a prolonged stress, as it is the case during a
      surgical procedure for example.

      The secondary objectives are: 1) to determine the relation between the value of basal
      cortisol and the peak of stimulation of cortisol during short and long tests. This could
      allow to clarify better the conditions in which it is absolutely necessary to realize a
      dynamic test, 2) to determine the relation between cortisol assay in the plasma and in the
      saliva. The sample of saliva is simple and non-invasive, and presents the advantage to be
      able to be realized in ambulatory conditions and by the patient himself.

      The cortisonic withdrawal syndrome is another complication which can arise when a prolonged
      corticosteroid therapy is discontinued. Clinically, it looks like a chronic adrenocortical
      insufficiency, but with normal ranges of plasma cortisol. It is probably in touch with a
      physical dependence to the taking of above physiological doses of GC over a long period. Its
      physiopathology remains badly known, but could bring in a deficit of secretion of DHEA-S
      (dehydro-epiandrosterone sulphate), another hormone secreted by the adrenal glands. One of
      the secondary objectives of the study will consist in informing the variations of DHEA-S
      after a prolonged corticotherapy, in the basal state and after stimulation by the long
      synacthen stimulation test.

      The purpose of this study is to measure the effects of MDMA on sleep, mood, thinking, and how
      your body retains water. The researchers are interested in the effects that occur a few hours
      after taking MDMA as well as effects occurring over the next two days. We will study these
      effects in a standardized, controlled setting at the Clinical and Translational Science
      Institute (CTSI) Clinical Research Center (CRC) located at San Francisco General Hospital.

      The primary hypotheses are:

        1. MDMA will induce sleep disruption, as indicated by comprehensive polysomnography, wrist
           actigraphy, and self-report sleep measures

        2. MDMA will alter sodium and water homeostasis by either increasing or blunting the
           suppression of arginine vasopressin levels and decreasing free water excretion. Effects
           will be exacerbated by water loading.

      Secondary hypotheses:

        1. Acutely, MDMA will increase both positive and negative arousal, and to increase
           sociability but not autonomy.

        2. Acutely, MDMA will increase risk-taking and willingness to donate money to others in an
           economic decision making task.

        3. MDMA will decrease the stressful effects of talking about a negatively-valenced
           autobiographical but will increase recall for details for these episodes.

        4. MDMA will increase oxidative stress markers and possible ameliorating factors (e.g.,
           ADMA).

        5. The short form of the serotonin transported promoter region will be associated with
           greater acute and discontinuation effects of MDMA.

      Several iron compounds are used for fortification, including ferrous sulphate and NaFeEDTA.
      The absorption profile of these may differ because of differences in their dissolution in the
      gastrointestinal tract and in their interaction with dietary inhibitors of iron absorption.
      As these differences might lead result in varying reactions in the blood stream, the
      appearance rate of the stable iron isotope, hepcidin, non-transferrin-bound iron and total
      iron in the plasma will be monitored over six hours in adult women. This is relevant as a
      spike of absorbed iron may increase non-transferrin-bound iron and this could be
      pro-oxidative or increase growth of pathogens. Hepcidin is a key mediator of iron absorption
      and will help explain the potential differences in the plasma iron profile.

      The use of stable iron isotope appearance curves to specifically detect the appearance of
      small amounts of absorbed iron in the blood and distinguish between circulating body iron and
      iron absorbed from the test meal was tested in a pilot study (EK 2008-23). This method is now

NCT01054209,Electric Warming Mattress to Prevent IPH During LSCS,"
      This study will demonstrate whether an electric warming mattress can reduce the number of
      patients who get cold and shiver after elective cesarean section.

      Peri-operative hypothermia (body temperature below 36 ºC) is a cause of post-operative
      complications and patient discomfort. Immediately post-operatively such discomfort is due to
      increased pain and shivering. Patients say that their time in the recovery ward is very
      stressful and this is prolonged if they become cold (hypothermic)or shiver. Subsequently,
      patients can suffer with increased risk of infections and delayed discharge from hospital.

      For patients (and their babies) having Cesarean sections it is important to start breast
      feeding as soon as possible, but being cold may delay this.

      For some types of surgery measures are put in place to stop patients becoming cold and
      thereby reduce the number of problems. However this is not the case with patients undergoing
      Cesarean sections because the special blankets through which hot air is blown to keep them
      warm are inappropriate for mothers giving birth by Cesarean section as it would make it
      difficult for a mother to have good skin-to-skin contact with her new baby immediately after
      delivery - an important part in the bonding process.

      A solution is to use a new warming mattress. This has been shown to be safe and effective
      with some types of surgery, but has not been tested in Cesarean sections.

      In the investigators study,the investigators will warm a group of patients undergoing planned
      Cesarean section and compare them to an unwarmed group to see if there is any difference
      primarily in post-operative temperature. Secondarily, the investigators will also look for
      differences in total blood loss, incidence of blood transfusion, wound infection, shivering,
      the immediate health of the baby, time taken to become fit for discharge from recovery,
      length of hospital stay and time to breast-feeding.

NCT01055431,A Functional Food for the Prevention of Iron-deficiency Anemia,"
      It has been estimated that 1 in 2 women expecting a baby will be diagnosed with iron
      deficiency. In turn iron deficiency can affect the health and wellbeing or both mother and
      child. Studies show that low iron stores prior to conception and low iron intakes during
      pregnancy may both be contributing to this problem. Although dietary supplements may be one
      solution, research indicates that daily compliance is low (Nguyen et al., 2008). Furthermore,
      prescribed iron supplements may result in uncomfortable side-effects, including constipation
      (Wulff & Ekstrom, 2003).

      It is been observed in Ethiopia that iron deficiency anemia is lower than average; a finding
      that has been attributed to regular ""Teff"" consumption (Gies et al., 2003). Teff (Eragrostis
      tef) is a staple food usually consumed in the form of Enjera (flat bread prepared using a
      range of cereals). Research has shown that Teff is a rich source of iron that is easily
      absorbed by the body.

      Although it is believed that regular Teff consumption may prevent to onset of iron deficiency
      anemia there is no research to support this. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to
      es-tablish whether incorporating Teff into the daily diet may be one way to improve blood
      profile and prevent the onset of iron deficiency anemia in expectant mothers. Study findings
      will demonstrate whether Teff may be an alternative source of iron that can be easily
      incorporated into the daily diet of both pregnant mothers and the lay public.

      Obesity is a serious medical problem because it increases the risk of cardiovascular disease
      (CVD), type 2 diabetes mellitus, and certain forms of cancer. The definition of obesity is
      based on an excess of body fat, not of BMI. However, BMI is the reference used to establish a
      graded classification of weight relative to height. Although BMI is widely used as a simple
      surrogate measure of body fat and has been shown to correlate closely with adiposity, it
      would be more appropriate to determine body fat percentage and to use this value for
      classification purposes. The present study contemplates the determination of the per cent
      body fat with the aim of establishing new diagnostic and therapeutic criteria according to

      microenvironment - Hypoxia, Reactive Species (reactive oxygen and nitrogen species), HIF-1
      and VEGF, which we term the HRHV axis. Fifty breast cancer patients with planned surgical
      excision will be administered the hypoxia marker drug, EF5, 24-36 hr prior to surgical
      excision. EF5 is a non-therapeutic drug and provides no direct benefit to those patients
      enrolled in this pilot study. Tissues obtained intra-operatively will be snap frozen and
      subsequently analyzed for EF5 binding. Immunohistochemical analysis of a cohort of
      immunohistochemical and urine markers that depict the HRHV axis will be examined. The
      association of the markers with the presence of hypoxia, as determined by EF5 positivity,
      will be determined. Data from this pilot study will be used to establish the prevalence of

      The 2009 flu pandemic is a global outbreak of a new strain of influenza A virus subtype H1N1,
      commonly known as swine flu, that was first identified in April 2009. Large-scale
      immunization is an essential approach of controlling the pandemic.Vaccines are now becoming
      available for protection against pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009 infection in some
      countries.In response to the pandemic, novel vaccines against the virus strain
      A/California/07/2009(H1N1) have been developed and recently were approved for vaccination
      among specific populations in China. However, the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines is
      of prime concern to the authorities and the public.This report details the findings of a
      observational clinical trial of the safety and immunogenicity of a influenza A (H1N1)2009
      monovalent vaccine.

      The virus of Swine Flu H1N1 that outbroke in 2009 is sensitive to neuraminidase inhibitors
      (Oseltamivir, zanamivir and peramivir) but have drug resistant to adamantanamine derivatives
      (amantadine and Flumadine), therefore neuraminidase inhibitors are recommended for antiviral
      therapy against Swine Flu H1N1, effect of which is evidence by the data that such drugs do
      modify the symptoms and decrease the death rate of H1N1 in America and Mexico. However,
      clinically, the investigators have encountered that this virus can infect resistant strains
      of Oseltamivir, which urges for a more effective treatment plan.

      In view of above situations, seeking for an effective measures against H1N1 flu should be a
      top priority and will benefit human life and economy globally. This Topic will take the
      classic strategy of passive immunity to perform basic and clinical researches on applying
      blood fix to treat critical H1N1 patients and collect blood of healthy persons who are
      inoculated with specific H1N1 vaccines to cure critical H1N1 patients.

NCT01056003,Prevalence of Gastric Inlet Patches of the Cervical Esophagus.,"
      As known from several observational and retrospective endoscopic studies the prevalence of
      gastric inlet patches (GIPs) of the cervical esophagus is estimated between 1-10%. In most
      cases GIPs are found within endoscopy as an incident finding, since in most cases they are
      harmless and do not cause any symptoms. None the less several data exist where an association
      between GIPs and globus sensations is discussed. Case reports even refer to bleeding
      complications and moreover to malignant transformations of GIPs.

      As a result of the assumed association of GIPs and globus sensations we performed a pilot
      trial. Here we included 10 patients with globus and GIPs and were able to demonstrate a
      significant symptom relief after ablation of the GIP (Meining et al, Endoscopy 2006). To
      exclude a potential placebo-effect we concluded a multicenter and sham controlled trial where
      we imposingly were able to prove the symptom relief after ablation of the GIPs (Bajbouj et
      al, Gastroenterology 2009).

      All patients, who are scheduled for esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) in any of the above
      mentioned endoscopical departments are routinely standardized asked whether they have any
      hints suggestive for globus sensations (modified globus-questionnaire from Deary et al., J
      Psychosom Res 1995). Concurrently it is noted, whether the patients have endoscopical
      detected GIP. All GIPs are biopsied and examined in one institute. Together with anamnestic
      data (age, gender) a talley sheet gives a survey of all relevant information to prove or
      disprove following hypotheses.

      Study hypotheses:

        1. The presence of GIPs is associated with globus sensations. In other words: Do patients
           with globus sensations significantly more often have GIPs?

        2. GIPs are not congenital, they arise in the course of the time and become symptomatic. In
           other words: Do GIPs significantly occur in more elderly people?

        3. The more increased the GIPs diameter is the more likely globus sensations are present?
           In other words: Do huge GIPs cause significantly more often symptoms than small ones?

        4. The more mucus-producing mucosa is histologically proven the more likely globus
           sensations are present? In other words: Do we find more cardiac mucosa in patients with
           symptoms than fundus mucosa?

NCT01056094,Effects of Lutein Supplementation on Oxidative Stress and Inflammation in Healthy Nonsmokers,"
      Lutein is one of oxygenated carotenoids. Over the past few years, there has been increased
      interest in evaluating the effect of lutein for optimizing immune functions. A large number
      of epidemiological studies support the notion that a high intake of lutein is associated with
      a reduced risk of coronary heart disease and certain types of cancer. The biological
      mechanisms for the protective effects of this carotenoid, including powerful modulation of
      functions and antioxidant properties, are only partially known. Although several nutrients
      and phytochemicals have been shown to modulate immune functions in humans, few studies have
      investigated the role of lutein consumption. No information is available as to whether lutein
      supplementation could be protective against oxidative stress. Therefore, the objective of the
      present study was to examine the effect of consuming different doses of lutein on oxidative

      blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor
      can make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving anti-thymocyte globulin
      before transplant and tacrolimus and methotrexate after transplant may stop this from
      happening.

      The goal of this pilot study is to effectively treat hypertension in subjects with either
      known or newly diagnosed hypertension and concurrent evidence of diastolic dysfunction. Due
      to the unique properties of nebivolol, it is hypothesized that there will be improvements in
      left ventricular (LV) systolic and diastolic function manifesting as increase exercise
      capacity in this patient population with primarily LV diastolic dysfunction. The present

      The purpose of this study is to find out if NAVA-technology is better in detecting patients
      own inspiratory efforts during mechanical ventilation than currently used flow-triggering in
      PRVC (pressure regulated volume controlled) ventilation, and if NAVA gives real benefits for
      patients or not.

      The investigators study hypothesis is that NAVA-technology can detect spontaneous inspiration
      more accurately than currently used methods, and thus will lead to more smooth adaptation to
      mechanical ventilation in pediatric patients. The investigators expect this to decrease the
      time of ventilatory support needed.

NCT01057524,High Frequency Chest Wall Oscillation and Cystic Fibrosis,"
      High frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO) has been shown to increase tracheal mucus
      clearance compared with a control group. These observations led to the development of The
      Vest® which is a non-stretchable jacket connected to an air-pulse generator and worn by the
      patient over the chest wall. The generator rapidly inflates and deflates The Vest®, which
      gently compresses and releases the chest wall between 5 and 20 times per second. This
      generates mini-coughs that are said to dislodge mucus from the bronchial walls and to
      facilitate its movement up the airways. The Vest® has been shown to reduce the viscosity of
      mucus and this should further enhance mucus clearance.

      People with cystic fibrosis (CF), admitted to hospital with an acute infective pulmonary
      exacerbation, should increase the frequency and duration of their airway clearance sessions
      owing to the increase in quantity and viscosity of purulent bronchial secretions.In the
      United Kingdom, and in many other countries, the availability of physiotherapists to assist
      with the recommended number of daily treatments is insufficient to meet patient need. If the
      use of high frequency chest wall oscillation, in addition to 'usual' self airway clearance
      techniques, in the early morning and evening was to facilitate recovery from an exacerbation,
      this would indicate an important place for high frequency chest wall oscillation in the
      management of people with cystic fibrosis.

      Hypothesis:

      The addition of high frequency chest wall oscillation to twice daily supervised physiotherapy
      is as effective as the addition of self treatment in facilitating recovery from an acute
      infective pulmonary exacerbation, as measured by improvement in lung function, specifically
      forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1).

      Research has shown that anti-angiogenic agents can be effective therapies to treat cancer.
      Anti-angiogenic agents target the blood vessels required for tumors to grow. Vascular
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is one of the cell pathways used for this blood vessel
      growth. When the investigators interfere with the VEGF pathway, the investigators inhibit
      this blood vessel growth which is required by tumors. One of the study drugs being used,
      tivozanib (AV-951), selectively interferes with the VEGF pathway. The second study drug being
      used, everolimus (RAD001) interferes with the mTOR pathway. The mTOR pathway is another
      pathway involved in blood vessel and tumor cell growth. By combining these two drugs the
      investigators hope to slow or reverse tumor cell growth in patients whose tumors have become
      resistant to other therapies for their disease.

      - To study existing blood samples of children with autism spectrum disorders to evaluate the
      relationship between genetic traits and cholesterol function.

      Eligibility:

      - Children with ASD who donated blood samples to the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange.

NCT01059240,"SMN Copy Number Distribution in Mali, West Africa","
      Background:

        -  Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a degenerative and incurable neuromuscular disorder
           that is caused by mutations in the survival motor neuron gene, SMN1, found on chromosome
           5. It is the leading inherited cause of infant mortality. SMA carriers (those who have
           the genetic mutation but do not have the disease) are often unaware of their status
           until they are tested.

        -  Researchers have been studying the prevalence of SMA carriers in the general population,
           but most of the information collected has come from populations within the United
           States, Europe, and Asia. Very few studies have been performed in Africa. Furthermore,
           this information does not provide much information regarding carrier frequency based on
           ethnic background and ancestry. To address this problem, researchers are interested in
           studying the prevalence of the SMA genetic mutation in the sub-Saharan nation of Mali.

      Objectives:

      - To collect blood samples for use in studying genetic data related to spinal muscular
      atrophy.

      Eligibility:

        -  Healthy volunteers who are at least 18 years of age.

        -  Volunteers will be of Malian ancestry and nationality.

           initial SMA carrier testing and resolve any technical difficulties before continuing
           with the study.

        -  Participants will complete questionnaires about their personal and family medical
           history, including questions about illnesses, stillborns, and miscarriages, and then

NCT01059747,Therapeutic Drug Monitoring and Pharmacogenomics Study of Methadone Therapy,"
      Addiction has been regarded as one of the most serious health and social problems in Taiwan,
      and heroin is currently considered to be the major substance of abuse. The most widely used
      treatment to date is methadone replacement therapy. It is reported that to achieve a better
      clinical response and to avoid possible side effects, the blood level of methadone should
      remain in a certain level. However, the blood level of methadone is mediated by various
      factors besides dosage. Genetic variability in genes that encodes enzymes affecting methadone
      metabolism, target receptors of methadone, and drug-drug interaction by other medication
      patients take will all affect blood level. Therefore, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) and
      pharmacogenomic study is crucial for evaluating and predicting the clinical response, cause
      of side effects or toxicity, as well as studies on drug-drug interactions.

      This is a cross-sectional study in order to evaluate the relationship between methadone
      plasma level and clinical response in patients under methadone maintenance therapy and to
      identify optimal therapeutic thresholds. HPLC will be used to analyze methadone and its
      metabolites. Our hypothesis is that methadone plasma levels in patients who are responsive to
      methadone maintenance therapy are higher than level in non-responsive patients, and higher
      plasma level leads to less severe withdrawal symptoms. We will also test if an optimal
      minimal dosage exists among these patients. In the meanwhile, we will aim to test if
      methadone level and clinical response is correlated with different genetic polymorphism.
      Candidate genes that involve in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic process of methadone
      (e.g. CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP2B6, ABCB1, opioid mu receptor and kappa receptor) will be genotyped
      for these analyses.

      The results of this study will provide clinical information of methadone treatment and
      pharmacogenomic data in Taiwanese for clinicians to achieve a better treatment outcome.

      This tool is based on a previously-validated, widely-used, real-time educational evaluation
      tool (the Mini-CEX); published expert opinion; and our prior research . The investigators'
      tool incorporates unique role-based anchors for both senders and receivers that refer to

      Botulinum toxin injection in the contracting muscles has proven to be a safe and effective
      method of relieving pain and lessening dystonic posturing. The current hypothesis is that
      botulinum toxin works on altering sensory input in the central nervous system in addition to
      its effects on the neuromuscular junction.

      Magnetoencephalography (MEG)of brain has been used in dystonia such as writer's cramp and
      musician's hand dystonia. However, no study has investigated the correlation of central
      signal changes via magnetoencephalography before and after treatment with botulinum in
      torticollis patients. Prior studies using somatosensory potentials indicated the possibility
      of differential activation of precentral cortex in patients with cervical dystonia. Cervical
      dystonia may result from a disorder of both cortical excitability and intracortical
      inhibition. The investigators hypothesis is that botulinum injection modulates central
      inhibition which improves clinical outcome for torticollis.

      Patients with cystic fibrosis develop frequent and potentially life-threatening lung

      infection. Glutamine is an amino acid; a type of nutrient the body requires to build muscle.
      It is one of the building blocks of protein. During an illness, blood levels of glutamine
      tend to be lower than normal. Also, many patients with cystic fibrosis have difficulty
      getting normal levels of nutrients from food. The aim of this study is to see if patients
      with cystic fibrosis have low levels of glutamine when they experience an infection, and
      whether a dietary glutamine supplement taken daily for three months can raise these levels.
      We also want to see if this supplement can improve other blood markers of immunity (the

      Post operative ileus (POI), a temporary paralysis of the intestines, is a serious health care
      problem. It normally occurs in all patients after surgery to the abdomen but in some cases
      can result in serious complications. The objective of this study is to determine if inhaling
      very low doses of carbon monoxide (CO) before and after colon surgery will shorten the
      duration of normal POI and/or prevent the development of POI complications in patients
      undergoing colon surgery.

      A preliminary study will be conducted in six healthy volunteers to monitor for blood levels
      and adverse effects that occur at 3 different doses of inhaled CO to establish a safe dose
      for patients in the main trial. For the main trial, patients requiring surgery to their colon
      will be assigned randomly to receive one hour treatments of either CO or oxygen by face mask
      before and after their operation. Length of normal POI and occurrence of POI complications
      will be compared between the two groups. Side effects that occur from inhaling CO or oxygen

NCT01055405,Study of Sildenafil Effects in Combination With Rehabilitation in Patients With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and Associated Pulmonary Hypertension,"
      Sildenafil is a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor that has been approved for the treatment of
      pulmonary arterial hypertension with orphan drug designation. Sildenafil modulates the nitric
      oxide (NO) pathway in the vessel wall. Since this pathway is impaired in pulmonary arteries
      of patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease (COPD), the investigators hypothesized that sildenafil might improve pulmonary
      hemodynamics and increase exercise tolerance in this condition.

NCT01053585,Structure and Function of the Gastro-esophageal Junction,"
      Aims of research project:

      To identify key features of the gastro-esophageal junction (structure and function) that
      protects the esophagus from gastro-esophageal reflux investigated by combined high resolution
      manometry and magnetic resonance imaging.

      Hypothesis:

        1. Functional factors including GEJ function (e.g. sphincter pressure) and proximal gastric
           distension determine whether or not TLESR occurs; however

        2. Structural factors including separation of GEJ anatomy, intra-gastric distribution of
           the meal and secretions determine whether TLESR is accompanied by no reflux event, gas
           reflux (belching) or reflux of ingested food and gastric secretion ('true reflux').

        3. Initial findings by descriptive studies in healthy volunteers (study #1) and patients
           with mild to moderate gastro-esophageal reflux disease (study #2) will be further
           interrogated by a randomized, double-blind control trial of baclofen in patients with

NCT01053377,A Randomised Controlled Trial on the Effect of Post-exposure Oseltamivir Prophylaxis on Influenza Transmission in Nursing Homes,"
      The incidence of severe morbidity and mortality following an influenza infection during the
      annual influenza epidemics is highest among the elderly population and 90% of
      influenzaassociated mortality occurs in this group. Vaccination is considered the best
      preventive intervention available but offers only partial protection. The protective effect
      decreases with advancing age and existing co-morbidity. Therefore, in spite of high
      compliance with vaccination, the risk of influenza-related complications among nursing-home
      residents, is particularly high, and consequently also the associated disease and economic
      burden. There is debate on the potential health benefit of the antiviral activity of
      oseltamivir as an effective supplementary intervention to prevent or contain influenza
      outbreaks in nursing homes. Although effectiveness of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) with
      oseltamivir on preventing transmission has been demonstrated in trials among healthy (mainly
      unvaccinated) adults and children, effectiveness has not yet been assessed among vulnerable
      vaccinated highrisk groups, such as the elderly population in nursing homes. If proven
      (cost)effective, oseltamivir could have considerable benefits in this setting, although
      constraints relating to implementation need to be addressed as well.

NCT01055223,Fracture Risk With Thiazolidinediones,"

      risk of fractures in a randomized trial exploring the efficacy of rosiglitazone (RSG),
      metformin, or glyburide encompassing 4360 patients with type 2 diabetes.

      It is hypothesized that spironolactone, a diuretic that is broadly used for the treatment of
      fluid retention and edema associated with TZD, has a potential protective effect against bone
      fractures. However, to our knowledge, this has not been tested in diabetic patients treated
      with TZD. Amiloride is another diuretic that shares with spironolactone the anti
      mineralocorticoid ion gated channels activity and will be analysed in this study with regard
      to possible protective effect against bone fracture in combination with TZD.

      This study is a nested case-control study conducted among type 2 diabetes subjects exposed to
      TZD. The study aims to explore if the risk of fracture is reduced among type 2 diabetic
      subjects exposed to spironolactone and TZD. The study will compare the odds of any low impact
      fracture, and hand, foot, upper arm, wrist, and hip fracture incidence in subjects treated
      with TZD+spironolactone and TZD+amiloride compared to subjects treated with TZD only.

      The study population will consist of type 2 diabetes patients aged 18 -65 years old exposed
      to TZD. To be eligible for the study, a subject must have had at least one International
      Classification of Disease (ICD)-9 code for type 2 diabetes and have at least 6 months or at
      least 12 months of exposure to TZD (rosiglitazone [RSG], pioglitazone [PIO] or troglitazone)

NCT01055392,Disease-modifying Properties of Lithium in the Neurobiology of Alzheimer's Disease,"
      Lithium salts have been used for the treatment of psychiatric disorders for over five
      decades, mostly as a mood-stabilizing drug. Recent evidence points to the inhibition of the
      enzyme glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK3) as one of its mechanisms of action. The
      overactivity of this enzyme has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease
      (AD), given its involvement in mechanisms related to the hyperphosphorylation of Tau protein
      and the production of beta-amyloid peptide. These are key events leading respectively to the
      formation of neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques, which are the neuropathological
      hallmarks of the disease. Several in vitro and animal studies have shown that the inhibition
      of GSK3 by lithium and other agents attenuates these pathological processes, reinforcing the
      notion that GSK3 is a likely target for future disease-modifying therapies for AD. Indeed, a
      recent study published by our group showed that chronic lithium use is associated with a
      decrement in the expected prevalence of dementia, in a sample of elderly individuals with
      bipolar disorder. To investigate this putative neuroprotective effect in a prospective way,
      the investigators started 24-month randomized, double-blinded controlled trial of lithium for
      the prevention of dementia in a sample of elderly individuals with amnestic mild cognitive
      impairment (MCI), a condition associated with increased risk for the development of AD. The
      clinical and biological outcomes of this trial include the attenuation of cognitive deficits,
      and the modification of certain biological markers of the disease (as measured in the
      cerebrospinal fluid, leukocytes and platelets). The objective of the present application is
      to enable the extension of this ongoing trial to an additional 2-year follow-up. A longer
      follow-up (48 months) will increase the statistical power to ascertain the primary outcome
      variables of this study, particularly the con-version from MCI to Alzheimer's disease. This
      will warrant a more consistent conclusion about the potential of lithium treatment in the
      prevention of dementia, in addition to a better evaluation of safety and tolerability
      profiles of the long-term use of lithium in older individuals.

NCT01054599,Does Memantine Improve Verbal Memory Task Performance in Subjects With Partial Epilepsy and Memory Dysfunction?,"
      Many patients with epilepsy have memory deficits in the setting of otherwise normal
      intelligence. Unfortunately, the treatment options for memory dysfunction in patients with
      epilepsy are limited. The investigators are conducting a study to evaluate the effects of
      memantine for the treatment of verbal memory dysfunction in subjects with
      localization-related seizures. The study involves randomization to memantine therapy or
      placebo, with cognitive testing and EEG pre- and post-treatment, as well as after an
      open-label memantine treatment phase.

      The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of memantine for the treatment of
      verbal memory dysfunction in subjects with left temporal lobe epilepsy. The investigators
      expect that verbal memory task performance will improve in those taking memantine, but not in
      those taking a placebo.

      The investigators propose that the expected benefit of memantine is specific to verbal memory
      in subjects with left temporal lobe seizures, rather than representing an overall improvement
      in cognitive function. The investigators expect no improvement on other cognitive tasks in
      either the memantine or placebo groups.

      The investigators will evaluate whether subjects with left temporal lobe epilepsy and memory
      difficulties have self-reported improvement in memory while taking memantine. The
      investigators expect improvement of self-rated memory function on the Quality of Life in
      Epilepsy Patient Inventory (QOLIE-89) in the memantine group, but no change on this scale in
      the placebo group.

NCT01058148,A Comparison Study of Two Community Outreach-Based Approaches to Increase Participation of Women Living in the Mississippi Delta in Cervical Cancer Screening,"
      Background:

        -  The Mississippi Delta (which includes the counties along the Mississippi River) is one
           of the poorest areas in the United States. Women living in the Mississippi Delta have
           disproportionately high rates of cervical cancer, but they are unlikely to come to
           clinics except perhaps for giving birth, years before they are diagnosed with cancer.

        -  To improve rates of screening, researchers are attempting an outreach study to see
           whether under-screened women, if approached by door-to-door recruitment, would get
           screened by one of two methods (home-based self-collection and testing, or a clinic
           exam) and which method they would prefer.

      Objectives:

      - To assess/measure increased participation of under-screened women living in the Mississippi
      Delta in cervical cancer screening by offering women the opportunity to get screened by one
      of two possible community outreach-based cervical cancer screening modalities,
      self-collection and HPV testing or clinic-based cytology screening, the current standard of
      care.

      Eligibility:

      - Women between 26 and 65 years of age, who are not pregnant currently or in the past 8
      weeks, have an intact cervix, have no history of cancer, and have not been screened for
      cervical cancer in the past 3 years.

      Design:

        -  Researchers will recruit participants on a door-to-door basis. Researchers will recruit
           all eligible women within a household. Recruitment will be done only during daylight
           hours but at the end of the working day to maximize the chances of finding women at
           home.

        -  Eligible women willing to participate will complete a questionnaire with demographic and
           medical information.

        -  Participants will be asked to choose the screening method of their preference. If they
           choose self-collection with HPV testing, they will be given a self-collection kit and
           asked to perform the self-collection and return the kit within 1 month. Participants who
           choose to have cytology screening will be provided with the phone number and location of
           the local health department clinic and will be encouraged to schedule their screening
           within the following month.

        -  Women who do not complete their participation within 1 month will be considered
           noncompliant with their chosen intervention. Researchers will re-contact noncompliant
           women to offer them participation in the study, including permitting them to refuse to
           participate or to choose the alternative intervention....

NCT01058525,Influence of Ultrasonographic Hydro-dissection With Glucose 5% on Nerve Block Efficiency,"
      The real-time visualization of a needle and nerve during an ultrasound-guided nerve block can
      be challenging. These difficulties may partly explain the systemic complications of local
      anesthetics under ultrasound. Injection of small amounts of a solution around the
      anesthetized nerve (hydro-dissection) has been proposed to enhance contrast outlining its
      borders and also to improve the visualization of the needle tip. The glucose solution 5%
      solution is interesting because it allows, unlike saline, to maintain the motor response with
      neurostimulation. The hydro-dissection can be particularly useful when one suspect hypoechoic
      vessels near the nerve to be anesthetized. Thereby, the nerve well demarcated and separated
      from the vessels, injection of local anesthetic is performed in the circumferential diffusion
      space (like a small pocket) without redirecting needle.

      The influence of this hydro-dissection on the nerve block efficiency is unknown. The nerve
      block quality can be improved because the entire anesthetic is injected in contact with the
      nerve, but it can also be reduced due to the dilution of the local anesthetic by the glucose
      solution.

      In this randomized study, the investigators test the hypothesis that hydro-dissection does
      not alter the nerve block onset time.

      Background:

      - Research has shown that the hormone corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is involved in
      stress and anxiety, and that drugs that block the effect of CRH in the body can reduce
      anxiety. GSK561679 is an experimental drug that attempts to reduce anxiety by blocking the
      effect of CRH. Researchers are interested in comparing GSK561679 with other treatments for
      anxiety.

      Objectives:

      - To determine the effectiveness of GSK561679 compared with placebo and alprazolam (Xanax),
      as a possible treatment for fear and anxiety.

      Eligibility:

      - Healthy female volunteers between 21 and 50 years of age.

      Design:

        -  This study will involve one screening visit, four testing visits, and one follow-up
           visit over a period of 8-9 weeks. The testing sessions will be between 6-11 days apart.

        -  Participants must follow these dietary restrictions to participate in the study.

        -  No nicotine, alcohol, or caffeine (including chocolate and soft drinks) for 24 hours
           before the start of the study.

        -  No nicotine in the past 6 months, and no nicotine until the final blood sample is
           collected at the follow-up visit.

        -  No alcohol or caffeine for 24 hours before a testing visit or for 72 hours after each
           visit.

        -  No grapefruit or grapefruit products from 14 days before the first dose of study
           medication until collection of the final blood sample.

        -  Participants will receive a dose of GSK561679, alprazolam, or placebo 3 hours before the
           testing, and will take an additional pill 1 hour before the testing.

        -  During the tests, participants will receive brief electric shocks and hear sudden loud
           noises. The noises and shocks will be given over a period of approximately 40 minutes
           per session.

        -  Skin conduction, heart rate, and blinking will be monitored throughout the tests, and
           participants will be asked about anxiety levels and will be tested on mood, memory, and
           concentration. Blood and saliva samples will also be taken during these sessions.

        -  Participants will stay in the clinical center for 1 to 2 hours after the study testing
           to ensure that the sedation has worn off. Participants will not be allowed to drive home
           or take public transportation alone after study visits, so alternative transportation

      The study is designed to assess the effect and safety of oral administration of VECAM 40/300
      administered at bedtime compared to Esomeprazole 20 mg administered 30-60 minutes before

      The rational for the study is based on the contention that VECAM exhibits potent inhibition
      of acid secretion and because of its mechanism of action, it can be administered at bedtime
      without food. Such timing of drug dosing will allow effective inhibition of nighttime acid
      secretion. Because of its mechanism of action, VECAM exhibits improved 24-hour inhibition of
      acid secretion and hence, its bedtime administration will not compromise its effect during
      the daytime. This improved control of acid secretion will predictably result in better
      control of nighttime as well as daytime heartburn (HB) symptoms.

      Anti-migraine drugs, including triptans, are not indicated for use in pregnancy. However, the
      peak prevalence of migraine is in women of childbearing age. This, coupled with the sporadic

      exposure to anti-migraine medications during pregnancy likely. Prior to an anti-migraine
      medication being marketed there are few data available on drug safety in pregnancy: data from
      animal models may not translate directly to humans and pregnant women are routinely excluded
      from clinical trials. The Sumatriptan Pregnancy Registry was established by GlaxoSmithKline

      RATIONALE: Bortezomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Biological therapies, such as thalidomide and lenalidomide, may
      stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Drugs used
      in chemotherapy, such as dexamethasone, cisplatin, doxorubicin hydrochloride,
      cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and melphalan, work in different ways to stop the growth of
      cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Combining

NCT01051726,Effects of Aromatherapy on Childbirth,"
      Aromatherapy is a form of complementary medicine that uses scented materials known as
      essential oils for the purpose of affecting a person's health or mood. Although aromatherapy
      has been used in childbirth for centuries, there are no high-quality studies examining
      whether the treatment works.

      Methodology

      We would like to see if aromatherapy affects a woman's experience of childbirth by lowering
      associated anxiety and pain. Consenting participants will be randomly allocated to one of
      these groups:

        1. Aromatherapy oils (e.g. clary sage, peppermint, lavender, frankincense)

        2. Non-essential oil (baby oil)

        3. Standard maternity care

      We will gather primary data, e.g. if she's been in labour before and her awareness of
      complementary medicine. We will also conduct the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory
      with her, and provide her with the oil and swab if she is in groups 1 or 2 with instructions
      to keep the swab with the oil on it near to her. She can also put more oil on the swab as she
      requires.

      Postnatally, data will be collected from her notes regarding pain relief used, duration of
      labour, augmentation of labour, and any other medical interventions of note. We will also
      complete the anxiety scale with her once more. Before her discharge we ask the mother for any
      comments regarding her experience of the labour. The results from all three cohorts will then
      be compared. There will also be opportunity for the midwife to make any comments regarding
      his/her perception of the participant's labour. Finally we will hold a focus group with
      midwives regarding the practicalities for implementation of aromatherapy in maternity care

      compare the results of total thyroidectomy done in 6 months following the appearance of the
      symptoms of ophthalmopathy and the antithyroid drug therapy in patients with moderate to
      severe Graves' ophthalmopathy.

      The inclusion criteria: 1)Hyperthyroidism and moderate to severe Graves' ophthalmopathy
      within 6 months, 2)Thyroid volumes greater than or equal to 15 mL in thyroid ultrasonography,
      3)Patients taking no treatment except local medications for Graves' ophthalmopathy,
      4)Clinical activity score of 3/7 or more, proptosis greater than or equal to 21 mm in one eye
      or 2 mm difference between two eyes, presence of diplopia, the opening of the eye lid greater
      than or equal to 9 mm.

      All patients will be treated with antithyroid drug until TSH levels of the patients are
      between 0.4-1. During this period all the patients will take pulse methyl prednisolone
      treatment of a total dose of 4.5 gr. After pulse steroid treatment the patients will be

      Historically, sickle cell disease has not been viewed in the chronic pain paradigm because of
      its recurrent nature. Patients with sickle cell disease may be hospitalized for extended
      periods of time. As the hospital stay progresses, patients with SCD pain are often observed
      by clinicians to have improvements in function in areas such as self-care, mobility, and
      recreation despite continued self-report of high pain scores. This pattern of functional
      improvement with continued report of high pain intensity scores is common in patients with

      Rates of overweight and obesity are increasing, particularly among individuals aged 18 to 29.
      An estimated 25-35% of American college and university students are overweight or obese.
      Contingency Management (CM) is a behavioral intervention that provides tangible rewards for
      positive behaviors. CM has substantial evidence of efficacy in reducing smoking and drug use
      and increasing treatment retention and medication compliance. The current study will evaluate
      the efficacy of a 24-week CM intervention to promote weight loss in overweight and obese
      university students. Seventy participants with a body mass index (BMI) of 27.0-34.9 will be
      randomly assigned to one of two conditions: (a) LEARN, a manual guided behavioral weight loss
      program (Brownell, 2004), with weigh-ins and supportive counseling, or (b) LEARN with
      weigh-ins and supportive counseling plus CM. Participants in the CM condition will earn
      chances to win prizes each week in which they lose at least one pound. Once they lose 5% of
      baseline body weight, they will earn chances to win prizes for weight loss or weight
      maintenance. Additional chances can be earned by completing activities that promote weight
      loss. The primary outcomes will be absolute and proportional weight loss from pre- to
      post-treatment, as well as proportion of participants achieving clinically significant weight
      loss (>5% of baseline weight) and proportion moving into a lower risk BMI category. Secondary
      outcomes will include length of retention in the study, increase in physical activity level,
      and improvement in nutritional quality of diet. Effects of the CM intervention on psychiatric
      distress and self-efficacy and motivation to engage in activities that promote weight loss
      will also be assessed. We predict that participants in the CM condition will lose more weight
      than participants assigned to the LEARN program without CM, and that more CM participants
      will achieve clinically significant weight loss. We also predict that participants in the CM
      condition will remain in the program longer, show larger increases in physical activity, show
      greater improvements in diet quality, and have greater increases in levels of self-efficacy
      and motivation than comparison group participants. Mediators and moderators of CM outcomes
      will also be evaluated. If efficacious in promoting weight loss in a college population, CM
      could help to prevent or delay later development of obesity-related medical problems.

NCT01057979,Motivational Interventions for Lifestyle and Exercise in College Students,"
      Engagement in substance-free activities, such as exercise, has an inverse relationship to
      substance use in college students. While exercise has numerous physical and mental health
      benefits, the majority of college students are sedentary, infrequently engaging in exercise.
      Although exercise interventions to date often suffer from significant attrition and poor
      adherence, motivational interventions for exercise are beginning to show promise. In this
      pilot study we propose to develop and evaluate a novel exercise intervention combining
      Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET) with contingency management (CM) in sedentary college
      students who use alcohol.

      Restenosis due to neointimal hyperplasia causes repeat target vessel revascularization in a
      relevant number of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI).
      Drug-eluting stents (DES) are currently adopted to reduce the rate of restenosis; however,
      they may increase risk of stent thrombosis.

      Experimental data and first clinical experiences showed that inhibition of neointimal
      hyperplasia may be obtained by local administration of anti-proliferative drugs (like
      paclitaxel) loaded on the surface of angioplasty balloons. Data on the efficacy of novel
      coronary drug-eluting balloons (DEBs) are lacking.

      Aims of this open label prospective, randomized trial is to evaluate neointimal hyperplasia
      in patients undergoing bare-metal stent (BMS) implantation alone compared to those receiving
      additional DEB use and to assess if the technique of DEB use may affect the degree of
      neointimal hyperplasia.

      The major aim of treatment for rheumatoid arthritis is remission. Nevertheless, structural
      radiographic progression is observed in 15 to 20% of patient getting remission. Numerous
      definitions of the remission proposed by literature remain imperfect.

      Recently ultrasonography and MRI seem to be helpful in diagnosis and follow-up of rheumatoid

NCT01051934,"A Phase I Trial of SS1 (dsFv) PE38 With Paclitaxel, Carboplatin, and Bevacizumab in Subjects With Unresectable Non-Small Cell Lung Adenocarcinoma","
      Background:

        -  Advanced cases of non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) usually are not successfully
           treated with standard therapies. Even treatments that attempt to specifically target
           NSCLC cells have not proved effective.

        -  Researchers are interested in determining whether a combination of the chemotherapy
           drugs SS1 (dsFv) PE38, paclitaxel, carboplatin, and bevacizumab may be effective in
           shrinking the size of NSCLC tumors. Three of the drugs (paclitaxel, carboplatin, and
           bevacizumab) are commercially available, while the other is a drug that is currently
           being tested to determine its usefulness in cancer treatment. This study will help to
           determine if the combination of all four drugs is more effective and as safe, safer, or
           less safe than other drug combinations given to treat NSCLC.

      Objectives:

      - To determine a safe and tolerable dose for the combination of SS1 (dsFv) PE38 with
      paclitaxel, carboplatin, and bevacizumab in patients with advanced mesothelin-expressing lung
      adenocarcinoma.

      Eligibility:

        -  Age > 18 years of age

        -  Newly diagnosed advanced non-small-cell lung carcinoma

        -  No prior chemotherapy for lung cancer

        -  Individuals at least 18 years of age who have advanced non-small-cell lung carcinoma
           that has not responded to standard treatments.

      Design:

        -  The study will last for two 21-day cycles of treatment for the four-drug combination,
           with additional treatment cycles of carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab.

        -  Two to three weeks prior to the study, participants will be screened with a full medical
           history and physical exam, bone marrow biopsy (we do not do bone marrow biopsies) (if
           one has not been performed in the last 6 months), computed tomography (CT) or ultrasound
           scan, tumor measurements, and other tests as required by the researchers. Participants
           will provide blood and urine samples at this time as well.

        -  During the study, participants will receive SS1 (dsFv) PE38, carboplatin, paclitaxel,
           and bevacizumab for a maximum of two cycles. On Day 15 of the first cycle, participants
           will provide a blood sample to be tested to see if SS1 (dsFv) PE38 is being effective.
           If the tests show that SS1 (dsFv) PE38 is not effective, participants will not receive
           another dose of it, but will continue to receive paclitaxel, carboplatin, and
           bevacizumab for the second cycle.

      Even if most patients in palliative care units presented with well-recognized risks factors
      of venous thromboembolism (VTE) (eg: active cancer, bed rest, previous history of venous
      thrombosis), the incidence of VTE in palliative setting is unknown. By consequence, the
      efficacy and safety of antithrombotic prophylaxis in such a population is not established.
      Indeed, patients admitted in palliative care units were not included in trials evaluating the
      potential effect of antithrombotic drugs in regard to their poor prognosis at short term. In
      addition, the main role of prophylaxis is to prevent sudden death from pulmonary emboli and
      is thus a life prolonging therapy which is viewed as counterintuitive to palliative care
      philosophy and inappropriate on grounds of futility. Nevertheless, the current use of Low
      Molecular Weight Heparin in palliative care units seems to increase particularly in patients
      with advanced malignancy. The identification of high hemorrhagic risks in palliative care
      patients could help the decision of antithrombotic prophylaxis initiation. For this, the

NCT01052246,Pulsed Dye Laser Treatment of Acne Vulgaris,"
      The results of pulsed dye laser (PDL) treatment of acne vulgaris published so far are
      controversial: Whereas Seaton et al. described a marked improvement of mild-to-moderate acne
      after low-fluence pulsed-dye laser therapy, Orringer et al. were unable to replicate said
      results in a similar, albeit not identical, study design. More recently published studies
      failed to resolve the controversy, varying in terms of treatment procedure(s) as well as
      results.

      While published results are certainly promising enough to be followed up by independent
      research, they are insufficient to justify the abdication of methods with proven efficacy.
      Considering patient treatment ethics and the short 'window of opportunity' for scar
      prevention when active inflammatory lesions are present, the investigators planned the
      adjuvant application of the PDL in the present study, providing all patients with the well
      established and evidentially effective modality of a fixed-combination clindamycin 1%-benzoyl

      established for the original case control study in 2007, will now be expanded to include an
      additional five to six years worth of data. These data will provide greater power to
      investigate the risk of isolated oral clefts, specific cleft types and potential associations
      with additional specific malformation types (e.g. neural tube defects). Data on cases of
      isolated oral clefts registered between 1993 and 2012 will be extracted from EUROCAT member
      registers meeting set inclusion criteria (ensuring completeness of outcome and exposure
      data). The primary comparison group will include all non oral cleft, non chromosomal

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping
      them from dividing. Carfilzomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the
      enzymes needed for cell growth. Thalidomide may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking
      blood flow to the tumor. Giving combination chemotherapy together with carfilzomib and
      thalidomide may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of carfilzomib when
      given together with cyclophosphamide, thalidomide, and dexamethasone in treating patients

NCT01054274,a Multicentric Randomized Controlled Trial of Self-Expandable Esophageal Radiation Stent,"
      Esophageal cancer is common in some areas , ranking as the fourth leading cause of death from
      cancer in China and sixth worldwide. Although the prognosis of surgical resection for
      esophageal cancer has been improved, more than 50% of such patients are inoperable and have
      to undergo palliative treatments because of late stage cancer or metastasis. Dysphagia is the
      predominate symptom of patients with inoperable esophageal cancer. To relieve the dysphagia
      and improve the quality of life of such patients, brachytherapy has previously been utilized.
      Recently, stent placement has been widely accepted to be an option for palliation of the
      symptoms due to the esophageal strictures. Brachytherapy and esophageal self-expanding stent
      insertion have longer benefit. Stent insertion provides fastest improvement of
      dysphagia.However, recurrence of the neoplastic stricture remains a challenge after stent
      placement, complications in later setting occur and require further endoscopic treatment.
      Brachytherapy has slower onset of benefit but has fewer complications and longer benefit.To
      combine the advantages of the immediate relief of the esophageal dysphagia with the stent
      placement and radiation therapy with brachytherapy, a novel esophageal stent loaded with 125I
      seeds has been developed in the authors' institute. The technical feasibility and safety with
      this new stent has been demonstrated to be adequate in a healthy rabbit model. And a
      small-sample and unicentric prior clinical trial in the authors' institute certificated the
      novel esophageal stent can relieve the dysphagia caused by advanced esophageal cancer rapidly
      and improve the quality of life markedly. This current multicentric randomized clinical trial
      is further studying the novel esophageal stent loaded with 125I seeds to see how well they
      work compared with a conventional covered stent in patients with malignant dysphagia caused
      by advanced esophageal cancer.

      The male sex-hormone called testosterone is known to play a key role in the growth of
      prostate cancer. The usual treatment for the disease involves suppression of hormones
      (testosterone) by anti-hormonal treatment for an unknown period of time until the cancer
      progresses. This anti-hormonal treatment usually consists of injections every three months
      with an LHRH(Leutinizing Hormone-Releasing Hormone) agonist and a short course of
      anti-androgen pills, which together help to lower the production of testosterone. Long-term
      hormonal treatment has potentially serious side effects and is expensive.

      to participate. The aim of this study is to see if we can decrease the amount of hormone
      injections that patients require. This might lead to a decreased side effects(such as
      decrease in bone health, cardiovascular problems and metabolic syndrome which occurs when
      several health conditions happen at the same time and can lead to an increased risk of heart

      the choice of therapy for the individual patients to optimize treatment outcome and to reduce
      unnecessary toxicities. Development of novel therapies or novel approaches to therapy is also
      critical to improve the treatment armamentarium in breast cancer. These research strategies
      will have an significant impact on breast cancer treatment both in Singapore as well as
      globally.

NCT01050777,Efficacy of Topical Liposomal Form of Drugs in Cutaneous Leishmaniasis,"
      Leishmaniasis with diverse clinical manifestations is caused by different species of
      Leishmania and is endemic in many countries. Although Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (CL) is a
      self-healing disease, but it takes a long time to heal. Pentavalent antimonials are still the
      first-line treatment of CL which needs multiple injections, are painful and as such not
      tolerated by most of the patients, in addition available treatments are not always effective
      and resistance is reported. Paromomycin sulfate (PM) reported to show anti-Leishmania
      activity against both CL and visceral leishmaniasis (VL) since 1960s. Therapeutic strategy
      with high efficacy is urgently needed especially for Anthroponotic Cutaneous Leishmaniasis
      (ACL). Liposomes are lipid bilayer molecules which entrap water-soluble molecules in their
      internal water compartment and water-insoluble ones into their lipid bilayers. Liposomes, in
      proper formulations and sizes, deliver drugs to the skin based on the similarity of the
      bilayers structure of lipid vesicles to that of natural membrane and target the macrophages
      within dermis. Several lipid-based formulations have been developed to treat experimental
      leishmaniasis. Recently different doses of liposomal formulation of PM and liposomal
      formulation of Glucantime were prepared and showed high efficacy in vivo against L. major
      infection in BALB/c mice.

      In this study the efficacy of liposomal formulation of PM or liposomal formulation of

      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and effectiveness of the combination of the
      drugs Temsirolimus and Capecitabine and see what effects it has on cancer.

      Temsirolimus is a drug that is given by vein that targets a protein important for the growth
      of cancer cells known as mTOR. By inhibiting this protein, Temsirolimus can inhibit cancer
      cell growth and even lead to their death.

      Capecitabine is a more traditional chemotherapy. It is an oral pill that gets converted in
      the body to the very common chemotherapy known as 5-fluorouracil.

      This research is being done because it is not known if the combination of Temsirolimus and

NCT01050153,The Clinical Utility of Thrombelastography in Guiding Prophylaxis of Venous Thromboembolism Following Trauma,"
      This study plans to learn more about how to prevent blood clots in the veins of your
      extremities. You are at risk of forming these clots after a major injury and when you have
      had surgery and are hospitalized on bed rest.

      Usually, patients in the SICU at Denver Health who are at risk for blood clots receive
      preventative treatment with a FDA-approved medicine called Fragmin. Fragmin is intended to
      prevent blood clots from forming but, with the way it is generally used, some patients may
      still develop blood clots. All patients treated with Fragmin to prevent blood clots at Denver
      Health, currently receive the same Fragmin dose. This treatment is called the ""standard of
      care"".

      So far, in the US, there has not been a commonly available test that can tell us:

        -  if the standard dose of Fragmin is enough to prevent blood clots for everyone, or

        -  if different patients need different doses, or

        -  if other blood clot preventing medicines, that work in a different way, should be used
           in addition to Fragmin.

      The ability of your blood to clot and the strength of the clot formed can be described by a
      FDA-approved blood test called thrombelastography, referred to as TEG. TEG may provide us
      with answers to each of the questions above. Our preliminary data indicate that it is helpful
      in assessing both clotting and bleeding tendencies and may prove useful in guiding treatment
      for the prevention of blood clots.

      The aim of this study is to determine if a treatment plan using Fragmin, and, if indicated,
      one or two additional FDA-approved medicines called anti-platelet drugs, guided by the
      results of TEG testing, may be better at preventing blood clots than our current standard of

      up), distributed (moved around), metabolised (broken down) and excreted (removed) by the
      body, in relation to time. The first PK trial only went up to 8 mg/kg, and, as there has been

      People with colorectal cancer that cannot be cured by surgery are being asked to participate
      in this study.

      The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy (effectiveness) of a new combination of
      drugs, ABT-888 and temozolomide for patients with colorectal cancer. Temozolomide acts by
      damaging deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in rapidly dividing cells, in other words, cancer cells.
      ABT-888 inhibits an enzyme called ""PARP"" which helps to fix damaged DNA. By inhibiting this
      enzyme, ABT-888 prevents cancer cells from repairing the damage caused by the temozolomide,
      and will hopefully increase the killing of cancer cells, and decrease the tumors in the body.

      ABT-888 is an investigational or experimental anti-cancer agent that has not yet been
      approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in colorectal cancer.

      This study will help find out what effects (good and bad) the combination of drugs,
      temozolomide and ABT-888 has on colorectal cancer.

NCT01062880,"Neuropattern - Assessment of a Translational Diagnostic Tool for Depression, Adjustment- and Somatoform-disorders","
      Neuropattern is a first translational tool in stress medicine. Neuropattern is a diagnostic
      tool, which can be applied by in- and outpatients and physicians to detect dysregulation in
      the stress response network. The physician provides anamnestic and anthropometric data, while
      the patient takes other measures at home, e.g. psychological, symptomatic, and biological
      data. Among the biological data are ECG measures for analyses of heart rate variability, and
      salivary cortisol measures before and after a dexamethasone challenge test. All data are
      analyzed in a central laboratory, which generates a written report for the physician,
      including a disease model, from which personalized recommendations for pharmacological and
      psychological treatments are derived. Neuropattern additionally offers individualized
      internet modules to inform the patient about the disease model and to teach him/her what
      he/she can do to improve his/her medical conditions. The current study applies Neuropattern
      in 2000 patients of family doctors, suffering from major depression, depressive episodes,
      adjustment disorders, and somatoform disorders. The patients receive either unspecific or
      individualized internet modules in a randomized order.

NCT01063114,Proton Beam Radiotherapy for Medulloblastoma and Pineoblastoma,"
      There are two types of external radiation treatments (proton beam and photon beam). As part
      of the participant's treatment, they will receive radiation to the entire central nervous
      system (CNS); this is known as craniospinal irradiation (CSI). In the past, photon radiation
      therapy has been used for CSI. In this study we will be examining the effects of proton beam
      radiation therapy. Studies have suggested that this kind of radiation can cause less damage
      to normal tissue than photon radiation therapy. The physical characteristics of proton beam
      radiation let the doctor safely deliver the amount of radiation delivered to the tumor that
      is normally delivered through standard therapy but spare more normal tissue in the process.

NCT01063296,Effects of Chemotherapy on Circulating Tumor Cells and Recurrences in Cervical Cancer Patients,"
      Cervical cancer is a major health problem for Chinese women. It is estimated that nearly
      100,000 new cervical cancer cases occur in China every year, which accounts for about 20
      percent of global new cases. Surgery and radiotherapy are two major radical treatment methods
      for IB-IIB cervical cancer. Unlike the United States and some other countries, most of
      operable women with IB-IIB cervical cancer received radical surgery other than radiotherapy
      in China. Patients with recurrence risk factors (lymph node metastasis, deep stromal
      invasion, positive lymphatic vascular space, et al. ) also received adjuvant therapy after
      surgery, such as radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy that are recommended in the NCCN
      guidelines. However, in China a substantial part of patients especially those admitted to
      tertiary hospitals received several courses of chemotherapy instead of radiotherapy if they
      had recurrence risk factors .

      In our previous study, we found that patients with intermediate risk factors (deep stromal
      invasion, positive lymphatic vascular space, bulky tumor>4cm) had better disease-free
      survival and recurrence-free survival when they received chemotherapy compared with
      radiotherapy. The objective in this study is to investigate whether the advantage of
      postoperative chemotherapy is a result of circulating tumor cells (CTC) in some of the
      patients with intermediate risk factors.

      Fondaparinux is a synthetic antithrombotic agent with specific anti-factor Xa activity. A
      population pharmacokinetic model of fondaparinux, based on data obtained in patients included
      in phase II/III trials, has been described. However, the validity of this model in everyday
      practice needed to be confirmed. This study was a multicenter, prospective cohort study in
      consecutive orthopedic patients treated with 2.5 mg of fondaparinux. Anti-Xa activities were
      recorded in 809 patients. Population parameters and inter-individual variability were
      estimated using NONMEM VI software. A two-compartment model with first-order absorption best
      described fondaparinux pharmacokinetics. Covariates partly explaining inter-individual
      variability were body weight, age and creatinine clearance estimated by the simplified
      Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula. A body weight less than 50 kg and moderate
      renal failure increased drug exposure. These results suggest that fondaparinux
      pharmacokinetics need to be confirmed in patient populations not fully assessed in phase

NCT01064050,Role of a Silicone Prosthesis to Prevent Airway Obstruction Recurrence in Lung Cancers,"
      A tumoral obstruction of the main stem bronchus is frequently observed in the follow-up of
      lung cancers with a high impact on survival and quality of life of these patients. The
      endoluminal resection of these tumors through interventional bronchoscopy can remove the
      tumor but fails to prevent the recurrence. A stent insertion could achieve this goal but this
      option was never proved in a prospective protocol.

      The aim of this study is to analyze the impact of stent insertion on the survival without
      symptoms of bronchial obstruction in patients treated for their cancer with and without a
      first line treatment (chemo-radiotherapy or chemotherapy). The patients will be included
      after resection of the endoluminal symptomatic tumoral obstruction. We will test the effect
      of the silicone stent insertion ( from NovatechR ) by comparing a stent arm (170 patients
      with stent insertion) with a control arm (170 patients without stent). The inclusion period
      will last 3 years with one year of follow-up for each patient. The one-year survival without
      symptomatic recurrence (proved on bronchoscopy with more than 50% of obstruction in the
      treated zone) will be the main endpoint. All patients without symptomatic recurrence at one
      year will be controlled endoscopically. Survival and stent tolerance will be studied as
      secondary endpoints. All endoscopic events will be depicted on photographs or videos. Each
      endoscopical situation (before and after resection, recurrence or side effects of stents)
      will be analyzed and registered by an independent committee of 3 international experts.

NCT01065597,Nonconvulsive Electrotherapy: a Proof-of-concept Trial,"
      This study involves pilot testing of a modified version of a proven treatment for mental
      illness. The treatment, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is used to treat more than 100,000
      Americans yearly. ECT is the most effective treatment for major depression, a disorder that
      affects approximately 5 to 8 percent of the adult US population yearly. It is also an
      effective treatment for mania and mixed mood states associated with bipolar disorder and
      schizoaffective disorder.

      The aim of ECT is to induce a seizure, which is thought to be responsible for both its
      therapeutic and its adverse cognitive effects. The proposed modification consists of reducing
      the ECT electrical stimulus dose below the amount necessary to induce seizures so that
      adverse cognitive effects, such as confusion and memory problems, are minimized.

      The investigators intend to determine whether ECT-related cognitive impairment can be reduced
      without diminishing the therapeutic effect of ECT. In addition to distressing patients,
      ECT-related cognitive impairment has significant public health consequences. These include
      increased morbidity and mortality among severely ill individuals who refuse ECT due to
      concern over its adverse cognitive effects as well as increased falls among the elderly
      receiving ECT. Elderly patients are far more likely to receive ECT and are also more
      vulnerable to ECT-related cognitive impairment. They often require hospitalization for ECT
      and a longer hospital stay with greater spacing of treatments to minimize adverse cognitive
      effects.

      The hypothesis driving this research is that electrical brain stimulation applied in the same
      manner as standard ECT, but at a lower dose, can have therapeutic effects and fewer adverse
      cognitive effects without inducing seizures. This hypothesis is based on the following: 1)
      the investigators clinical experience of patients who have improved with ECT despite having
      only one or no seizure, 2) animal studies showing that electrical brain stimulation can
      induce antidepressant like effects in animals without inducing seizures, 3) reports from the
      1950s that ""subconvulsive"" and ""nonconvulsive"" electrotherapy was effective for some
      patients, and 4) the recent approval by the US Food and Drug Administration of the use of
      transcranial magnetic stimulation --a technique that uses a magnet to induce an electrical
      current in the brain without inducing seizures--for treatment of medication resistant major
      depression.

      The primary aim of the research is to conduct a proof of concept, open trial investigating
      the therapeutic efficacy and safety of nonconvulsive electrotherapy (NET). The investigators
      plan to enroll 16 subjects, which is the minimum number of subjects needed to show that the
      therapeutic effect of NET is better than would be expected of placebo. If the investigators
      show that the therapeutic effect of NET exceeds that expected of placebo and does not induce
      significant cognitive impairment, then the investigators will go on to propose a blind,
      randomized, controlled clinical trial that more definitively tests the investigators'
      hypothesis. The investigators would use the information gathered from the pilot trial to
      estimate the number of subjects needed to definitively test the efficacy and safety of NET.

      The secondary aim of the study is to find out whether NET affects blood levels of
      brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). BDNF is a substance that is important to the
      nervous system and may be related to how treatments like ECT or possibly NET improve
      symptoms. The investigators would draw a blood sample before and after NET treatment to
      assess this.

      WMC nurses (RN) currently are involved in the medication reconciliation process. In 2009, a
      Medication Use Evaluation (MUE) of Medication Reconciliation Accuracy found a 67% medication
      error rate on admission determined by comparing the nurse-obtained medication history to the
      pharmacist-obtained medication history. The number of home medications identified by the
      pharmacist compared to the nurse was 411 versus 312 (p<0.0001). The total percentage of
      medication errors prevented by the pharmacist was 66.2. Using the VA Healthcare Failure Mode
      Effects Analysis - HFMEA™ Hazard Scoring Matrix, 3 independent pharmacist reviewers found
      that 18% of patients interviewed had a score greater than 7, and 3 patients had a score of 12
      (major/probable), if the discrepancies would not have been identified and corrected by the
      pharmacist conducting the admission medication reconciliation audit. The same patients'
      discharge medication reconciliation and discharge medication lists were retrospectively
      reviewed for the MUE, and the total percentage of patients with medication errors on
      discharge was 43%.

NCT01065818,Early Prediction of Pathology Response of Chemoradiotherapy With FLT PET,"
      The goal of this research study is to learn if a new type of PET scan (18F-FLT) can help to
      better detect changes of tumor growth rate (or how active) in esophagus cancer and lung
      cancer Researchers will study at what time during treatment the 18F-FLT PET scan should be
      given to get the best results. A Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan is a type of scan
      that uses a radioactive solution to locate cancer cells inside the body. Using the PET scan,
      doctors can locate solid tumors and collect information about how ""active"" the cancer cells
      are. For this study, a new type of solution, [F-18]-ﬂuoro-L-thymidine (FLT), will be used.
      FLT can detect actively growing tumor, and researchers hope that FLT may be able to help
      provide information about how well esophagus cancer treatment is working. This information
      could be used to help predict if the cancer will respond to treatment.

      All enrolled subjects will receive PET/CT imaging at pre-Neoadjuvant Therapy and post-3 weeks
      Neoadjuvant Therapy (3 weeks from the start of Neoadjuvant Therapy) prior to the surgery. At
      each time of the PET/CT procedure, the subject will receive an injection of FLT which is an
      investigational pharmaceutical labeled with radioactive ﬂuorine. 45-60 mines after the FLT
      injection, the scan will be performed. Each scan might take 10-15 minutes. Participation in
      this pilot study will not change the patients normal chemotherapy, radiation treatment, and

      Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion with or without decompression is a well-established
      surgical treatment for spine patients with the appropriate indications. Anterior approach
      involves some retraction that affect the midline structures of the anterior neck. Irritation
      and swelling may result, leading to postoperative dysphagia and the less common but
      critically important occurrence of postoperative airway compromise. Steroids given
      intraoperatively may reduce the incidence of these adverse outcomes by reducing the degree of
      swelling within the anterior neck subsequent to local surgical tissue trauma.

      The investigators hypothesize that the use of steroids intraoperatively provides a
      significant benefit to the patient, in terms of reduced incidence of dysphagia and airway

NCT01066377,"PRIMAGE (Probiotics, Immunity and Ageing)","
      Ageing dramatically affects immune function; this phenomenon is known as immunosenescence and
      partly explains the increased susceptibility for infection in older individuals. Vaccination
      is recommended to protect older people against influenza, but immunosenescence also reduces
      the efficacy of vaccination. Probiotics are beneficial bacteria, which can be consumed and
      which have a long and safe record of use in humans. Often they are taken together with
      prebiotics, which are carbohydrates that provide a food source for the beneficial bacteria
      when they reach the lower gut. There is particular interest in the positive influences of
      pre- and probiotics in older people, who are subject to alteration in gut microflora
      composition as well as immunosenescence.

      The PRIMAGE (Probiotics, immunity and ageing) study will examine the effect of a prebiotic
      and probiotic mix on the immune response to influenza vaccination in young and older
      subjects, and is funded by BBSRC DRINC. It will involve 60 young (18-35y) and 60 older
      (65-85y) subjects recruited from the local Reading community. Participants will take a pre-
      and probiotic mixture or a placebo for a total of 8 weeks. The probiotic is not currently
      commercially produced, but has been demonstrated to have particular ecological fitness and
      anti-pathogenic effects in the gastrointestinal tract in old age. A suitable prebiotic will
      be selected on the basis of ability to promote optimal growth and survival of this probiotic.
      After 4 weeks on the treatment, the subjects will receive an influenza vaccination. Blood,
      saliva and stool samples will be taken before treatment, and at 4, 6 and 8 weeks after
      commencement. The samples taken at 6 and 8 weeks will be used to assess the immune response
      to the vaccination. A wide range of immune parameters will be assessed, taking into account

      The primary purpose of this study is to measure the level of an enzyme in a patient's heart
      called inducible nitric oxide synthase(iNOS) using Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging
      with a radioactive tracer called 18F-NOS. These PET results will be compared to tissue
      results obtained during routine endomyocardial heart biopsy. The enzyme iNOS produces nitric
      oxide in inflammatory diseases such as acute heart transplant rejection, diabetes,
      Alzheimer's and cancer. Thus, PET with the radioactive tracer 18F-NOS may be a useful tool
      for detecting the early stages of these diseases. The safety of 18F-NOS during the study will
      also be assessed. All PET imaging will be performed with a CTI/Siemens Biograph 40 PET/CT

NCT01066871,Sprifermin (AS902330) in Cartilage Injury Repair (CIR),"
      Several people all over the world suffer from cartilage injuries in the knee. Symptoms
      include pain, joint swelling, and loss of function. Without repair, cartilage injury may
      ultimately lead to osteoarthritis (OA). Natural healing is poor, and to date treatment is
      available only for deep cartilage defects involving also the underlying bone. A promising
      candidate for drug treatment of cartilage injury is sprifermin (AS902330), a recombinant form
      of the human fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 18.

      So far, the drug has been used in subjects with different stages of knee OA in two ongoing
      studies without emerging safety issues following single and multiple intra-articular
      injections of ascending doses. However, OA represents late-stage cartilage injury, where
      repair might be difficult due to diffuse damage, reduced responsiveness of the cartilage,
      and/or the involvement of other joint structures.

      This clinical trial is meant to provide the proof of concept and to identify an efficacious
      dose of sprifermin (AS902330) for the treatment of adult subjects with acute cartilage

      pro-active self-management among inner-city dwelling Mexican-Americans with Type 2 diabetes
      mellitus. The study aims are to demonstrate that a CHW, compared to an attention control,
      will: 1) result in improvement in short term physiologic outcomes (Hemoglobin A1c levels and
      blood pressure), and 2) result in increased frequency of self-management behaviors (daily
      self blood-glucose monitoring, medication adherence, adherence to diet and physical activity
      recommendations). The study design is a single site, partially blinded, randomized controlled
      trial of 144 patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus.

      Eligibility criteria include a diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes, residence in target community
      areas in the Chicago area, and Mexican or Mexican-American ethnic heritage. Participants are
      randomized to either an experimental group receiving 36 home visits over a two year period in
      which a CHW delivered diabetes education and self-management skills training, or to an
      attention control consisting of 36 bilingual diabetes education newsletters covering the same
      curriculum as the CHWs. The curriculum covers recommended diabetes self-management behaviors
      including glucose self-monitoring, responding to abnormal blood glucose levels, working
      effectively with health care providers, medication adherence, foot care, daily physical
      activity, and reducing fat content of diet. CHWs also deliver training in behavioral skills
      of self-monitoring, environmental restructuring, engagement of social support, stress
      management, and problem-solving skills to facilitate the self-management activities.

NCT01068301,A Pediatric Study of a Plerixafor Containing Regimen In Second Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation,"
      Patients with refractory hematologic malignancies, including those who develop recurrent
      disease after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) have a dismal
      prognosis. Historically, both regimen-related mortality and disease recurrence have been
      significant causes of treatment failure in this heavily pre-treated patient population. Novel
      therapeutic agents that target molecular signaling mechanisms and increase the sensitivity of
      leukemic cells to apoptosis may clearly play a role in this setting.

      This study hypothesizes that interrupting the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis using the selective CXCR4
      antagonist plerixafor may be useful as a leukemic stem cell mobilizing agent for patients who
      are refractory to standard dose chemotherapy and in relapse after an allogeneic transplant.
      This hypothesis is based on the dependence of leukemia cells on MSCs for survival signals as
      described above and on the preclinical data that suggest increased efficacy by antileukemia
      agents when leukemia cells are separated from MSCs.

      In the present trial, the study proposes to add plerixafor to enhance the conditioning
      regimen cytotoxicity. At this time the goal is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      of plerixafor through the process of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) evaluation. Pharmacokinetic
      studies will be conducted. Additional studies will quantify and the content of leukemia cells
      and key regulatory and effector T cell populations in the bone marrow and blood before and
      after exposure to this medication.

      If the observed outcomes of this trial are promising, it could serve as a platform on which
      to study further use of plerixafor as a complimentary agent with conditioning as well as
      other chemotherapeutic regimens for patients with relapsed or refractory hematologic

NCT01061255,Stress and Clinical Reasoning in Medical Students,"
      Solving a problem in ambulatory setting may contain peripheral stress due to socio-evaluative
      stressors (patient's expectations about explanations) and task contingent stress due to time
      pressure, the necessity to take into account patient's mood, to deal with uncertainty of
      their own data collection and with complex clinical situations. In France, excepted for
      family medicine, undergraduate medical students and residents are currently not trained to
      perform consultations and are never exposed to ambulatory patients during training. The
      investigators postulate that this lack of practice may generate a significant state of stress
      during the first consultations and consequently modify or even impair clinical reasoning.

      The primary objective of this study is to compare subjective and physiological levels of
      acute stress in ambulatory versus hospitalization setting in medical students confronted to a
      real patient with a diagnostic problem.

      Measures: The French version of the Anxiety Spielberger test is administered just before and
      after each problem solving session.

      Cortisol salivary samples are taken before and after each problem solving session. Salivary
      cortisol levels have been shown to be correlated to stressful situations and some personality
      traits but with some difference according to gender.

      Pacemaker technology is constantly evolving. In the past 10 years, numerous advancements have
      been made in pacemaker therapy, diagnostics and connectivity. These advancements include
      automated capture, automated sensing, patient alert functions, algorithms minimizing
      ventricular pacing, automatic mode switching in response to atrial tachyarrhythmia, rate
      responsive pacing, advanced diagnostic features, remote monitoring and radiofrequency (RF)
      technology. However, little information is available on how these new features are being
      utilized by physicians in the real world and how these features impact patient outcomes.

      This observational study will gather data on the patients' presenting clinical status,
      indication for device implantation, utilization of advanced device features, device therapy
      choices, clinical management and outcomes in a general pacemaker population.

      The primary aim of the study is to evaluate the usage of advanced features and diagnostics in
      patients with St. Jude Medical pacemakers. The secondary aim of the study is to learn more
      about the progressive clinical outcomes in the general pacemaker patient population. The

NCT01061840,Trial of Bi-shRNA-furin and Granulocyte Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor (GMCSF) Augmented Autologous Tumor Cell Vaccine for Advanced Cancer,"
      Autologous Vigil™ vaccine expresses rhGMCSF and bi-shRNAfurin from the Vigil™ plasmid. The
      GMCSF protein is a potent stimulator of the immune system, recruiting immune effectors to the
      site of intradermal injection and promoting antigen presentation. The furin bifunctional
      shRNA blocks furin protein production at the post transcriptional and translational levels.
      This decrease in furin in turn decreases the conversion of the proforms TGFβ1 and TGFβ2
      proteins. Also, reduced furin protein levels have a negative feedback inhibition on TGFβ1 and
      TGFβ2 gene expression, decreasing the levels of their mRNAs. The resulting decrease in TGFβ1
      and TGFβ2 proteins reduces the local immunosuppression they cause and promotes tumor surface
      antigen and MHC protein display.

NCT01062386,"Malaria Survey in Mbarara District, Uganda 2010","
      Malaria is one of the major public health problems in Sub-Saharan Africa. In response to this
      threat, Roll Back Malaria (RBM) has rolled back a strategy using ACT as first line therapy
      for malaria episode, a wide distribution of Insecticide Treated Bednet (ITN), intermittent
      presumptive treatment of pregnant women and indoor residual spraying. Recent epidemiological
      observations suggested a decline in malaria prevalence in some countries but further
      evidences are still needed to confirm this evolution. The RBM strategy requires the use of
      reliable rapid diagnostic test (RDT) for which an operational assessment is necessary.
      Lastly, home-based management of malaria is also an important compound of this strategy.
      However, a better understanding of the actual use of antimalarial drugs, of the use of bednet
      and of the barrier to the use of health care is important to implement good quality
      strategies for malaria control.

      This study is a cross-sectional community based survey made of two rounds (one in January
      2010 and the second in June 2010). The general objective is to measure the prevalence of
      infection with Plasmodium falciparum at two periods of the year (at the moment of lowest and
      highest transmission based on the seasonal rainfalls) and to compare it with the prevalence
      estimated in 2004 after the rainy season for the same area. Specific objective are the
      estimation of the prevalence by age stratum, the analysis of the geographical distribution of
      the infection, the description of the parasitological characteristics, the assessment of
      three RDT, the description and the analysis of the prevention and care seek behaviours
      related to malaria.

      The study area is the great Mbarara district located in south-west of Uganda. A three-stage
      cluster sampling method will be used. Spatial information will be collected with global

NCT01064206,ADDICTAO: Psychological and Addictive Profile of Patients With Buerger's Disease,"
      Background: Buerger's disease (thromboangiitis obliterans or TAO) is a rare disease (1/ 10
      000) characterized by the development of segmental thrombotic occlusions of the medium and
      small arteries of the extremities. Afflicted patients are mostly young, male, inveterate
      tobacco (or cannabis) smokers who present with distal extremity ischemia, ischemic ulcers, of
      the toes or fingers. Large arteries are typically spared, as are the coronary, cerebral, and
      visceral circulations. Patients with TAO often suffer from severe ischemic pain and tissue
      loss culminating in minor and major limb amputation. Clinical diagnostic criteria generally
      include history of tobacco abuse; age of onset less than 50 years; infrapopliteal, segmental
      arterial occlusions with sparing of the proximal vasculature; frequent distal upper extremity
      arterial involvement (Raynaud's syndrome or digital ulceration); superficial phlebitis; and
      exclusion of arteriosclerosis, diabetes, true arteritis, proximal embolic source, and
      hypercoagulable states.

      While the cause of Buerger's disease remains unknown, the disease onset and clinical course
      are inextricably linked to tobacco (or cannabis) abuse. Tobacco abstinence generally results
      in disease quiescence and remains the mainstay of treatment. For some unknown reason,
      clinicians observed that TAO patients rarely discontinue smoking even though amputation is
      usually the inevitable consequence and the only method available of controlling pain and
      ulceration. Few studies were realized and Hofer-Mayer and coll. found remarkable personality
      features comparing to coronary patients: TAO patients significantly changed their place of

      to smoke more frequently during their illness, were more often single or divorced and had
      more conflicts in their relationships. Those facts led us to explore their psychopathology
      and their addictive profile.

      Purpose: Search the prevalence of personality disorders in Buerger's patients who present
      with tobacco or cannabis smoking.

      Hypothesis: Patients with Buerger's disease show remarkable personality features
      (psychological and addictive profile) which are vulnerability factors to stop smoking
      (tobacco or cannabis) compared to patients with atheromatous arteritis.

NCT01064934,Randomized Controlled Trial of Lipid Apheresis in Patients With Elevated Lipoprotein(a),"
      Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Non-medical
      treatment measures (e.g. dietary therapy or weight loss) can hardly influence Lp(a) plasma
      concentrations. Drug therapy has only limited influence, e.g. treatment with niacin. Statins
      are usually without effect. Lipid apheresis is the only treatment known to lower elevated
      Lp(a) levels in a relevant way. In patients with pronounced elevation of Lp(a) and normal LDL
      cholesterol levels, who suffer from progressive cardiovascular disease, the treatment with
      lipid apheresis seems to be a last-resort treatment option. The current trial will evaluate

NCT01067404,TIV Infant/Toddler Response Evaluation (TITRE)- Follow-up & Focus on Influenza B,"
      Each winter, viruses belonging to two kinds of influenza A (""A/H1N1"" & ""A/H3N2"") and two
      kinds of influenza B (""B/Yamagata"" & ""B/Victoria"") can cause illness. The yearly influenza
      vaccine is designed to protect against both kinds of influenza A but only one or the other
      kind of influenza B. The vaccine is changed from year to year, meaning it may include one
      kind of B virus one year and the other kind another year. But because influenza is so hard to
      predict, sometimes the kind of B virus chosen for the vaccine may not match the kind that is
      causing illness. The National Advisory Committee on Immunization recommends that all infants
      and toddlers receive influenza vaccine to protect against their high rates of
      hospitalization. Infants/toddlers receiving influenza vaccine for the first time must get two
      doses (prime plus boost) to have a good antibody response. If they have ever before received
      a single dose of influenza vaccine, then they are recommended to receive only one dose each
      year afterwards. But we don't know how well previous doses of one kind of influenza B set the
      stage for good antibody response to a single dose of the other kind of influenza B. This
      study will try to answer that question in a group of infants/toddlers who last year received
      two doses of one kind of B virus (""Yamagata""), as part of another study. This year, we will
      give them a single dose of influenza vaccine that now contains the other kind of B virus
      (""Victoria"") and see how much antibody they make to both kinds. About half these children
      received a higher amount of influenza vaccine in the previous year's study, so we will also
      compare their antibody levels on that basis. Since influenza B is an illness especially of
      children, understanding how to best protect infants/toddlers against both kinds of influenza
      B is important. This study will help us know if we need to design a new vaccine that not only
      includes both kinds of influenza A, but also both kinds of influenza B.

NCT01067547,A Trial of Iron Replacement in Patients With Iron Deficiency.,"
      Primary Hypothesis: There is no difference in the efficacy of iron replacement by oral or
      intravenous route in Inflammatory Bowel Disease patients.

      Iron deficiency anaemia is a common problem in people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
      and patients with excessive blood loss from the bowel or heavy menstrual loss. Treatment
      options include a blood transfusion, oral iron with (Ferrograd ®) or intravenous iron
      replacement with iron sucrose (Venofer®). Iron deficiency anaemia is associated with poor
      quality of life, poor concentration span and low energy level. Blood transfusion may improve
      symptomatic anaemia quickly but there is a risk of transfusion reaction and blood born
      infection transmission. Moreover, packed cells are scarce resource therefore its use needs to
      be carefully prioritized. Oral iron supplement has been widely used and it can be purchased
      over the counter, however, its efficacy is not known in IBD population. Oral iron is poorly
      tolerated with side effects include altered bowel habit, nausea and darken stools, making it
      difficult to adhere to. In contrast, intravenous iron therapy with Venofer® has been shown to
      replenish iron store and improve anaemia quickly. To date, the safety of Venofer® use has
      been supported by its post marketing surveillance. Limitations with intravenous iron
      replacement include the need for medical supervision in the setting of limited healthcare
      resources; the need for patients to take multiple days off work and the cost of Venofer®.
      Currently it is uncertain which method of iron replacement is better. The purpose of this
      study is to compare the efficacy and the cost of oral and intravenous iron replacement in the
      setting of iron deficiency anaemia.

NCT01069016,Comparison of Sacral Nerve Modulation and Pudendal Nerve Stimulation in Treatment of Fecal Incontinence,"
      Sacral nerve modulation (SNM) is an established treatment for refractory lower urinary tract
      and bowel dysfunction (Spinelli 2008). Pudendal nerve stimulation (PNS) has been proposed for
      patients failing SNM treatment of urinary dysfunction (Spinelli 2005). In this study SNM and
      PNS are compared for the treatment of fecal incontinence. In a test phase, both treatments
      will be applied for one week each in a randomized and blinded order (cross-over design).
      After the test phase the more successful treatment will be determined and applied
      permanently. If both treatments are equally sufficient, PNS will be chosen for permanent
      stimulation, since preliminary data indicate that PNS has a lower power consumption than SNM.
      Lower power consumption results in a longer lifetime of the stimulator, thus requiring less
      replacement surgeries.

NCT01062347,A Novel Bio-marker of Zinc Status,"
      Zinc deficiency is a widespread public health problem in developing countries. The true
      prevalence of this condition remains uncertain because of lack of a specific, sensitive and
      reliable biomarker for assessment of human zinc status. The most widely used indicator for
      measuring zinc status is serum zinc level, which, however, is homeostatically regulated and
      influenced by stress and infection. To explore the possibility of using mRNA levels of zinc
      responsive genes as an indicator of zinc status, Cao and Cousins suggested metallothionein
      (MT) mRNA level in monocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells as an indicator of recent
      zinc uptake. However, the usefulness of MT mRNA is also limited because its level is
      influenced by other metals, such as copper, cadmium and cobalt and it is also affected by
      stress. Several authors have proposed that expression of zinc transporter genes might be
      useful markers of Zn status. Evidence shows reduction in dietary zinc content produces a
      marked increase in intestinal absorption and decrease in intestinal zinc losses. As zinc
      homeostasis is regulated in the intestine, study of the zinc transporters in this organ may
      provide indication of recent zinc uptake. Recently, a few studies have begun to investigate
      the applicability of using white blood cell zinc transporter expression as an indicator of
      zinc status and found that some of the transporters are zinc responsive. The primary
      objective of this study is to explore whether the expression of zinc responsive genes, such
      as zinc transporters in human intestinal mucosal cells, can be used as indicators of zinc
      status. The specific aims are to compare gene expression in: a) intestinal mucosal cells
      obtained by duodenal biopsy, b) sloughed intestinal mucosal cells isolated from feces, and c)
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in fasting individuals who are receiving their
      usual diet + placebo or their usual diet + supplemental zinc (20 mg/d for 7 days). Gene
      expression values from intestinal mucosal cells (biopsy) will be compared between the placebo
      and zinc supplemented groups. Similar comparison will be done in the cells isolated from
      stool and PBMCs. This study will also provide an opportunity to compare the relative
      responsiveness of gene expression and serum zinc concentration following supplementation and
      to explore the kinetics of any changes in serum zinc concentration. Thus, blood samples will
      be obtained for measuring serum zinc concentration on two occasions prior to the
      interventions and at specified intervals during and after the intervention.

NCT01062711,Dose Response of Whey and Soy Protein Ingestion With and Without Resistance Exercise in Elderly Men,"
      When we age, we lose muscle. It is not exactly clear why this happens, but we do know that
      this muscle loss can increase health risks and lead to health problems. Lifting weights (i.e.
      performing resistance exercise) and proper nutrition, in particular eating enough high
      quality protein, can help slow the loss of muscle mass or potentially even reverse it.
      Protein and resistance exercise are thought to do this by stimulating your muscle to make
      more proteins and/or potentially by slowing down the rate at which your body breaks proteins
      down. Whey protein is a high quality protein isolated from milk and is known to stimulate new
      protein synthesis for all proteins in your body. However, to date, the effect that whey
      protein has on muscle protein synthesis, particularly in the elderly has yet to be
      determined. Thus the purposes of this study are: 1) to determine if whey is an effective
      source of protein that will stimulate muscle protein synthesis in the elderly, similar to
      what we have previously seen in young persons; 2) to determine the smallest amount of whey
      protein to consume to maximally stimulate your muscle to make new proteins; 3) to see if
      performing resistance exercise will augment the increase in new muscle protein synthesis with
      whey consumption; and 4) to try and found out if whey is more effective than soy protein in
      stimulating new muscle protein synthesis and suppressing muscle protein breakdown in the
      elderly, similar to what we have previously seen in young persons

      Background:

      - Mitral regurgitation, or leaking of the mitral heart valve, is usually studied and assessed
      with an ultrasound test called a two-dimensional (2D) echocardiogram. While this test has
      proved very useful, technological improvements have helped researchers develop ways to study
      the heart valves using imaging with three-dimensional (3D) capabilities. In addition,
      recently developed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques may be able to provide better
      information about the causes and severity of the leak. Researchers are interested in testing
      these new techniques to determine their usefulness for patients with mitral regurgitation.

      Objectives:

      - To evaluate newer methods of studying mitral regurgitation severity using real-time 3D
      echocardiography (RT3DE) and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI).

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 21 years of age who have been diagnosed with more than mild mitral
      regurgitation.

      Design:

        -  Participants will have two procedures as part of this study: an echocardiogram and an
           MRI scan.

        -  For the echocardiogram, participants will have an ultrasound scan with a special kind of

           better image of the heart on the scan. The scan will take approximately 1 hour to
           complete.

        -  For the MRI scan, participants will have a standard MRI with special pads placed on the
           chest to provide better imaging of the heart. The scan will usually take between 45 and

      In order to persist in the liver, HCV has numerous nonspecific and specific strategies to
      overcome the immunity of the host. The crucial step in the establishment of viral persistence
      and chronic hepatitis is the avoidance of specific antiviral cellular immune response in the
      liver. Treatment with pegylated interferon alpha (IFNα) in combination with ribavirin (RBV)
      is the standard therapy for chronic hepatitis C is. The response to IFNα / RBV therapy
      depends on the effective cellular antiviral immune response in the liver. The understanding
      of the interaction between HCV and cellular immune response is important for the effective
      use of existing diagnostic techniques, the Individual control and adjustment of the current
      therapeutic approaches and the development of future therapeutic and immunization strategies.
      In this study, the investigators want to investigate cellular Immune responses in the liver
      of HCV infected patients and characterize the influence of these immune responses to the

      Antifibrinolytic drugs are used to decrease perioperative bleeding and allogeneic
      transfusions. The extensively studied antifibrinolytic drug aprotinin is efficacious but
      expensive, and has been proved to link to higher risks of serious side effects including
      renal problems, myocardial events, and strokes in patients undergoing CABG. After the
      secession of aprotinin in 2007, a marked increase of blood loss and transfusions in cardiac
      surgery took place. An effective and secure hemostatic agent is badly needed. Ulinastatin,
      urinary trypsin inhibitor(UTI), is a secreted Kunitz-type protease inhibitor with a wide
      inhibition spectrum, including plasmin. Limited studies offered clues to its antifibrinolytic
      effect. Tranexamic acid has been applied for years with convinced efficacy and safety. The

NCT01061814,A Study to Evaluate 3 Different Dosing Regimens of Mipomersen Administered Via Subcutaneous Injections to Healthy Volunteers,"
      Hypercholesterolemia is characterized by markedly elevated low density lipoproteins (LDL).
      Elevated LDL is a major risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD). Mipomersen is an
      antisense drug that reduces a protein in the liver cells called apolipoprotein B-100
      (apoB-100). ApoB-100 plays a role in producing low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)
      (the 'bad' cholesterol) and moving it from the liver to one's bloodstream. High LDL-C is an
      independent risk factor for the development of coronary heart disease (CHD) or other diseases
      of blood vessels. It has been shown that lowering LDL-C reduces the risk of heart attacks and
      other major adverse cardiovascular events.

      Mipomersen is an investigational product being studied to determine if it is safe and
      effective in lowering LDL-C in specific populations of patients with hypercholesterolemia.

      This phase 1 study is being conducted to evaluate 3 different dosing regimens (daily, 3 times
      per week, or weekly) in healthy volunteers for a total of 3 weeks of dosing. Study procedures
      will include blood testing and physical examinations to assess the safety and tolerability of
      the different regimens. Tests will also be done to determine how much of the drug is present
      in the circulation (blood flow in the body). Specific pharmacokinetic (PK) tests on the blood
      samples will determine what the body does to the investigational product after it is
      injected, including how it is absorbed, distributed, the rate at which drug action begins and
      the duration of the effect.

      Eligible subjects will receive study injections of either mipomersen or placebo over a 3 week
      period followed by a 12 week safety follow-up period.

NCT01066208,American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) Diagnostic and Classification Criteria for Primary Systemic Vasculitis,"
      Vasculitis is group of diseases where inflammation of blood vessels is the common feature.
      Patients typically present with fever, fatigue, weakness and muscle and joint aches. These
      symptoms are very common among many different diseases, not just vasculitis. A clustering of
      other symptoms, physical examination findings, blood tests, radiology and biopsy help make
      the diagnosis. There are currently no criteria to help doctors make a diagnosis of vasculitis
      when a patient presents with these non specific symptoms and they are reliant on previous
      experience and disease definitions. One of the aims of this project is to develop diagnostic
      criteria for the primary systemic vasculitides (granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's),
      microscopic polyangiitis, Churg Strauss syndrome, polyarteritis nodosa, giant cell arteritis,
      Takayasu arteritis). We, the investigators, will do this by studying a large group of
      patients with vasculitis and comparing them to a large group of patients that present in a
      similar way, but do not have vasculitis. By comparing the 2 groups we will create a list of
      items to differentiate between vasculitis and 'vasculitis mimics'.

      We also aim to update the current classification criteria. Classification criteria are used
      to group patients into different types of vasculitis, once a diagnosis of vasculitis has been
      made, and are useful for studying patients in clinical trials with similar or identical
      diseases. The current classification criteria (American college of Rheumatology 1990
      criteria) were developed 20 years ago, before the availability of some important diagnostic
      tests (e.g. antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies [ANCA]), and are now not consistent with
      some of the current disease definitions. Therefore to progress future research in vasculitis,
      it is important that the classification criteria are updated. We will recruit 260 patients
      with each of the 6 types of vasculitis and compare them with 1300 controls (patients with the
      5 other types of vasculitis), in order to determine the optimal combination of symptoms,
      signs and investigations that classify each person into the appropriate group.

NCT01066273,Somatosensory Based Treatments for Tinnitus,"
      Studies have established that the somatosensory system of the upper cervical region and head
      can be intimately involved in tinnitus. Tinnitus can arise directly from a disorder of the
      head and upper neck via the somatosensory system. Our clinical experience and review of
      reports of various types of treatments support the hypothesis that treatment modalities
      involving the somatosensory system can benefit individuals whose tinnitus is likely on a
      somatosensory basis, namely people with symmetric hearing thresholds but asymmetric widely
      fluctuating tinnitus. However these previous studies did not (a) limit their treatment
      population to only people with tinnitus on a somatosensory basis and (b) did not assess their
      results by considering this tinnitus subpopulation separately from the entire group of
      tinnitus subjects they treated. Hence, the purpose of this study is to re-assess these
      treatments by targeting people whose audiograms can not account for their tinnitus, such as

      in a very significant way.However, there is currently no prospective study comparing in a
      reliable way the double-transplantation to single-transplantation results.The investigators

      open, multicenter study carried out in the allogeneic transplant centers from the French
      society for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and cell therapy. The primary objective
      is to compare the incidence of transplantation failure in the two treatment arms.
      Transplantation failure, the primary endpoint of the study, is defined by the occurrence of
      one of the following events : transplant-related death, second allogeneic transplantation or
      autologous backup infusion for primary engraftment failure, autologous recovery. The
      financial impact of these double-transplantations being to date unknown, the project also

NCT01068184,"A Study to Assess Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of of AZD6553 in Healthy Volunteers and Patients With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)","
      AZD6553 is a new drug being developed as a possible treatment for patients with chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD refers to chronic bronchitis and emphysema, a pair
      of two commonly co-existing diseases of the lungs in which the airways become inflamed and
      the small airsacs of the lungs become damaged. This leads to a limitation of the flow of air
      to and from the lungs causing shortness of breath. In contrast to asthma, the limitation of
      airflow is poorly reversible and usually gets progressively worse over time. There is an
      urgent medical need for therapies that could slow disease progression by targeting the
      underlying mechanisms associated with the changes in the lungs in patients with COPD. AZD6553
      acts by reducing the activity of a protease found to be involved in the disease process in
      COPD. AZD6553 is being developed as a novel oral treatment to control the symptoms and
      exacerbations of COPD, and reduce the progression and severity of the disease. The purpose of
      this research study is to determine how safe and well-tolerated AZD6553 is and how much
      AZD6553 enters blood circulation by collecting blood and urine samples during the study. We
      are also investigating what AZD6553 is broken down into, when given orally, how much of the
      drug is cleared from the body via the kidneys, and the effect of taking the drug after food.

NCT01069549,Association of AGTR1 and ACACB Gene Polymorphism and Diabetic Nephropathy in Type 2 Diabetes,"
      India is the ""Diabetes Capital of the World"" with 41 million Indians having diabetes, with
      every fifth diabetic in the world being an Indian and type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM)
      constitutes the major chunk of diabetes. One of the most severe complications of diabetes is
      the development of diabetic nephropathy. Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the leading cause of
      end-stage renal disease (ESRD) worldwide. There are many identifiable risk factors of
      diabetic nephropathy like hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and proteinuria, the
      genetic factor is the main among all. Long-term observational studies show that nearly 30-35%
      of type 2 diabetic patients develop nephropathy, irrespective of glycemic control. The
      regional variation in diabetes prevalence and in the proclivity for diabetes induced renal
      disease; along with reports of familial clustering of nephropathy suggest a possible genetic
      basis. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of
      progressive renal diseases. In addition, the blockage of angiotensin II with either ACE
      inhibitor or an angiotensin type-I receptor antagonist has been found to prevent or delay the
      progression of renal injury associated with diabetes 5 and now these drugs are first-choice
      drugs for the treatment of diabetic subjects with hypertension. The genes encoding the
      renin-angiotensin system (RAS), such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), angiotensinogen
      (AGT) and angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AGTR1), have been reported to be the most probable
      candidate genes for diabetic nephropathy. As there is no data available for AGTR1
      polymorphism and DN in the north Indian T2DM, its out attempt to fill the scientific gap.

NCT01060397,A Controlled Trial of Extended Brief Interventions in Alcohol Dependent Patients,"
      Heavy alcohol consumption leads to various health problems and is now recognised to be an
      important public health problem. This is evidenced by the huge media attention recently
      focused on the use and misuse of alcohol, particularly by younger patients. At least 1 in 20
      of the population in the UK are physically and psychologically dependent on alcohol. This not
      only has consequences for the physical and psychological well-being of these patients, but
      has adverse consequences for their family, work life and society in general. Current
      treatments are mostly delivered in specialist units, which are few in number meaning that few
      patients get access to these services. This leads to a vicious cycle which results in
      multiple hospital admissions, ineffective treatments and continual drinking. It is therefore
      vital the investigators develop alternative effective treatments for these patients which can
      interrupt this vicious cycle.

      In patients who drink heavily, but are not yet alcohol-dependent, a treatment called brief
      intervention can help reduce overall alcohol consumption, and improve health and wellbeing.
      However, whether a similar intervention can help alcohol-dependent patients has not yet been
      established.

      In this study, the investigators aim to identify, treat and support alcohol-dependent
      individuals. Using an enhanced form of BI (termed extended brief intervention, EBI) as the
      basis of clinical care, the investigators will undertake a randomised trial comparing EBI
      with usual clinical care. The investigators will use various clinical and behavioural
      measures to assess the effectiveness of this treatment. The investigators will also be asking
      patients how they felt, and what they think of their treatment and the professionals
      delivering that treatment. If EBI is shown to be effective and is not too costly, it could
      provide a national framework for treatment of alcohol-dependent patients. This could
      potentially improve both the opportunities to access treatment and the choice of treatments
      available to patients.

      The investigators hypothesis is that Extended Brief Interventions (EBI) delivered to
      alcohol-dependent patients in a hospital setting by an Alcohol Specialist Nurse (ASN) will be
      effective in reducing overall alcohol consumption and improving the standard measures of
      alcohol dependence.

NCT01063686,The Cervical Cap in the Diagnosis of Rupture of Membranes in the Second Trimester,"
      Early preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) complicates 0.7% of pregnancies. When
      PPROM occurs before the 24th week,the risk of fetal and neonatal death is 70%. There is also
      a high risk of neonatal and maternal morbidity. When the diagnosis of PPROM is uncertain by
      physical examination, additional tests are needed. These tests have false positive and false
      negative rates. The gold standard for diagnosing PPROM is amniocentesis and dye test. This
      procedure has a risk of infection and abortion.Our hypothesis is that by using a cervical cap
      for 6 hours and repeated ultrasound exams we can diagnose or rule out PPROM in cases which
      are uncertain. Our study group will be pregnant women gestational age 14-23, suspected of
      having PPROM.

      critical questions currently facing HIV-infected pregnant and postpartum women and their
      infants:

        1. What is the optimal intervention for the prevention of antepartum and intrapartum
           transmission of HIV?

        2. What is the optimal intervention for the prevention of postpartum transmission in
           breastfeeding (BF) infants?

        3. What is the optimal intervention for the preservation of maternal health after the risk
           period for prevention of mother-to-child-transmission ends (either at delivery or
           cessation of BF)?

      The overall PROMISE protocol had three separate interventional components to address each of
      these three questions and was conducted at locations in Africa and other parts of the world.
      Due to variations in the standard of care for HIV-infected pregnant and postpartum women and
      their infants at different sites, not all of these questions were relevant. Therefore, two
      separate versions of the PROMISE protocol were developed, each containing only the relevant
      components. The 1077BF protocol was used at sites where the standard method of infant feeding
      was breastfeeding, whereas the 1077FF protocol was used at sites where the standard method of
      infant feeding was formula feeding. The analyses were collapsed across the two protocol

NCT01064830,Topical Cyclosporine Suspension for the Treatment of Brittle Nails,"
      Brittle nail syndrome (BNS) refers to nails that exhibit splitting, raggedness (fraying of
      the distal edge), and peeling (lamellar onychoschizia).(1) This is a common problem,
      affecting approximately 20% of women, with higher prevalence among the elderly.(2) A number
      of factors have been proposed as possible causes of nail brittleness, such as anemia, biotin
      deficiency, or cysteine deficiency. (3,4) However, most authors believe that brittle nails
      are usually caused by dehydration of the nail plate, either from repetitive cycles of
      hydration and dehydration related to hand washing or from exposure to dehydrating chemicals,
      such as those found in nail enamel and cuticle removers. (5,6) Inflammation of the nail as a
      potential contributing factor has never been studied.

      There are currently not consistently effective treatments for this condition. Restasis® is
      effective in treating keratoconjunctivitis sicca. This condition is characterized by the
      troublesome condition of dry eyes partially due to decreased tear production exacerbated by
      inflammation. The BNS manifests itself by nail plate dehydration. The two conditions have in
      common disruption of water balance which gives rise to problematic clinical disorders. The
      hypothesis is that a product which benefits tear production would also be effective for
      brittle nails which contain roughly 15% water.

NCT01065142,ETIC (Therapeutic Education in Heart Failure),"
      Use lay language. Background: Heart failure is an increasingly frequent current pathology due
      to the population aging and the improvement of acute and chronic heart failure management.
      Heart failure patients have a poor quality of life because of their symptoms (asthenia,
      dyspnea…) and frequent hospitalizations. Heart failure is an expensive disease: 1.5 % of the
      health expenses, 85 % in hospital cost with 200 000 hospitalizations in France per year.
      Previous studies were multidisciplinary interventions and not realistic in a daily practice
      for a general practitioner. The aim of this project is to integrate therapeutic education for
      heart failure patients in a current practice. The patient becomes competent to manage his
      disease and to identify acute heart failure signs.

      Main objective: Improve therapeutic education efficiency on life quality of heart failure
      patients in general practice.

      Second objectives: Describe heart failure patient's hospitalizations.

      Methods: Cluster randomized controlled clinical trial comparing intervention and control
      groups with a follow through for 19 months for each patient. A therapeutic education program
      will be proposed to the heart failure patients in primary care. The intervention group GP
      will follow a workshop concerning the therapeutic education concepts and the intervention.

      Endpoints: Life quality evaluation (SF-36 and Minnesota scales) and number of
      hospitalizations of patients in each group.

      Population: Heart failure patients in stages I, II, and III of NYHA in primary care. Cluster
      randomized surgeries in Auvergne (France).

      Expected results: The therapeutic education allows the patients to improve their quality of
      life, to be able to detect their illness signs worsening in a early manner, and to contact
      their doctor if needed. This would limit the acute heart failure due to treatment adaptation

      The accurate staging is an essential part for the treatment and prognosis of non-small-cell
      lung cancer (NSCLC). Whole body MR imaging proved to be effective in staging of NSCLC as much
      as PET/CT. And there were organs of strength for each modality in the detection of
      metastasis. Therefore, integrated approach using whole body MR and PET would be more
      beneficial for the accurate staging of lung cancer with improved diagnostic efficacies and
      reduced radiation exposure.

      The aim of this project is to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of side-by-side reading of
      whole-body magnetic resonance imaging/ positron emission tomography (MRI/PET) and to compare
      with that of whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (WB MRI) alone and that of integrated
      PET/CT in determining the stage of NSCLC.

      Patients with pathologically-proven NSCLC will be prospectively enrolled, if they are
      considered as surgical candidates for the treatment of lung cancer through conventional
      methods of staging, i.e. history taking, physical examination, blood tests, bronchoscopy, and
      enhanced chest CT scans. PET/CT will be routinely performed for the staging of lung cancer in
      our institution. For the purpose of this study, whole body MRI will be performed for these
      patients within 3 days from the date of acquisition of PET/CT. The results of TNM staging
      from each modality will be collected prospectively and their efficacies can be calculated
      based on the reference standards. Reference standards of T and N staging will be surgically
      confirmed. And M staging can be confirmed by biopsy, other imaging modalities, or follow-up
      more than 6 months.

NCT01065753,Multi-faceted Evaluations Following Weight Reduction in Subjects With Metabolic Syndrome,"
      Central obesity, core of metabolic syndrome, has been recognized as one of the rooting
      factors for development of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Although efforts have been
      devoted to the studies of central obesity and/or metabolic syndrome, much remained unknown as
      to how obesity influences cellular as well as cardiac functions, what is the central
      regulation of one's body weight.

      Weight loss is an undisputed way to improve cardiovascular and metabolic disorders in obese
      individuals. Previous studies have demonstrated that weight loss by 5% of initial weight
      universally provide substantial benefits in these subjects. However, there are little
      integrated research teams, composed of different disciplines, share common weight reduction
      program to look at different aspects of weight reduction in non-diabetic individuals with
      metabolic syndrome. The significances of this proposal we plan to target, namely Rho kinase
      activity from peripheral leukocyte, several cardiac functions measured by noninvasive
      technique (VP-2000) and MRI, circulating brain-derived neurotrophic factors (BDNF) levels,
      are fully explained detailed in each sub-proposal.

      In order to accomplish this integrated proposal, we will form research teams including
      endocrinologists, cardiologists, radiologists, and a coordinating data center. We pan to
      recruit 40 non-diabetic individuals with metabolic syndrome to participate this 12-16 weeks
      weight reduction program. Twenty-five age, sex matched non-diabetes lean will be served as
      controls. Oral glucose tolerance test, fasting blood obtained, noninvasive vascular and MRI
      examinations will be applied before and after weight reduction program in those achieving at
      least 5% loss of initial weight.

      In summary, this study will investigate the effects of weight loss on (1) Rho kinase activity
      obtained from peripheral leukocyte; (2). Aortic stiffness, central aortic pressure and
      hemodynamic by a noninvasive vascular profiling system (VP-2000); (3) Brain function
      specifically reflecting by circulating BDNF; (4). Aortic elastic properties and left

NCT01065896,Coronary Computed Tomography (CT) to Measure Coronary Calcification in Spinal Cord Injury (SCI),"
      Although conventional risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD) have been identified and
      routinely used to determine risk for CHD in the general population, a systematic approach to
      determine population-specific risk for CHD has not been performed prospectively in those with
      SCI. CHD is a leading cause of death in spinal cord injury, occurring at younger ages than in
      the able-bodied population. Conventional risk factors for CHD are high serum concentrations
      of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), low serum concentrations of high-density lipoprotein (HDL),
      diabetes mellitus (DM), positive smoking history, and positive family history of premature
      CHD.

      Coronary calcification (CAC) is a commonly occurring phenomenon that does not necessarily
      indicate significant obstructive disease. Studies have shown that a strong association exists
      between coronary calcification and coronary heart disease. The purpose of this study is to
      compare the CAC scores in persons with SCI with a historical control group of able-bodied
      persons from a national data base who will be matched for conventional risk factors for
      coronary artery disease (CAD) and to determine the relationship between CAC scores and

      cure rates ranging from 50-60% with modern dose-dense immunochemotherapy regimens such as
      R-CHOP14. Using an alternative strategy, as infusional and dose-adjusted R-EPOCH, the

NCT01067183,Does a Portable Biofeedback Tool Reduce Physician Stress?,"
      Given the nature of their work duties and work environment, physicians often experience
      stress within the workplace and chronic stress negatively impacts physician wellness.
      Physician wellness is now linked to quality of patient care. The stress response can be
      broken down into four components: the stressor, the reaction, the physiological response and
      the experience of the physiological response. Stress can also be absolute (e.g. threat to
      life) and relative (e.g. I have 3 more consults to see). Stress management refers to a range
      of processes that are intended to mitigate one or more aspects of the psychobiology of
      stress. Biofeedback is a useful way of providing guidance and reinforcement for successful
      management of the physiological response to stress. It is important to provide physicians
      with effective tools for stress management. The objective of this study is to compare
      measures of stress and well-being among physicians allocated to learn a relaxation breathing
      technique and to use a biofeedback tool (referred to as a portable stress management device
      or PSMD) for 28 days (intervention group) and those allocated to standard care for 28 days

NCT01067846,Cognitive Enhancement and Relapse Prevention in Cocaine Addiction,"
      For this project, the investigators are interested in exploring a new way to extend and
      maintain drug abstinence in people who are addicted to crack cocaine. This study will combine
      a medication called D-Cycloserine (DCS) and weekly cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to
      assess whether the combination will enhance people's ability to stay clean (drug free) for
      longer periods of time.

      One of the greatest risks for drug relapse is drug craving. Oftentimes drug craving occurs
      when a person is confronted with stressors and reminders of past drug use behavior. DCS has
      been shown to enhance the learning of new information. By administering DCS prior to learning
      new techniques such as how to cope with drug craving and drug-use reminders, it is possible
      that patients can be more successful at living a drug free life for a longer period of time.

      In addition to exploring this model behaviorally, the investigators will explore changes that
      may occur in the brain before and after the therapy/medication intervention. A technique
      called MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) will be used to identify areas of the brain that are
      being activated during an attention task. Areas of neural activation will be assessed at
      study entry, end of therapy (4-week endpoint) and one month following completion of the

NCT01067937,Study for a Rational Management of Appendicitis in Children,"
      Despite the fact that appendicitis is one of the most frequent surgical pathology in
      children, its clinical management is still debated. Previous reports have shown rate of
      appendectomy in children without appendicitis up to 30 %. Morbidity, due to infectious
      complications or intestinal obstruction, is often between 5 and 10 % of published cases, and
      increase medical and social costs. Evidence-based medicine concept could therefore be
      worthwhile in that context, in order to promote rational diagnosis and treatment of that
      frequent medical condition.An algorithm describing management of children with suspicion of
      appendicitis was established, based on recent published data, in order to reduce delay
      between first clinical signs and confirmation of the diagnosis, and to define therapeutic
      indication such as conservative management and interval appendectomy or patient requiring
      laparoscopic approach. The main objective of the study is to decrease morbidity and
      unnecessary appendectomy rates, and secondly to decrease costs, by the use of that algorithm.

      Current medical therapies are not able to prevent progression of established macroproteinuira
      (i.e. diabetic nephropathy) to end-stage renal failure in type 1 (insulin dependent) diabetic
      patients. In this setting, proteinuria is a major risk factor for mortality. Pancreas
      transplantation, on the contrary, can revert diabetic nephropathy and thereby prevent
      end-stage chronic renal failure, with theoretically lower risk of death as compared to
      current medical therapies.The main objective of this study is to assess superiority of
      isolated pancreas transplantation versus intensive exogenous insulin therapy in type 1
      diabetic patients with overt diabetic nephropathy and mildly reduced renal function. The
      primary endpoint is a composite efficacy/failure end-point including: patient mortality and

      Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) / Kala-azar (KA) is a public health problem in the many countries
      in the world including Bangladesh. Where more than 90,000 VL cases have been reported since
      1994. The disease is fatal if not treated. Even with treatment the mortality rate is high
      (10%). VL is a vector-borne disease, caused by the parasite Leishmania donovani (LD) and is
      transmitted by female sandfly sp. Phlebotomus argentipes. Not all people exposed to the LD
      parasite develop disease. According to our observation only about 30% of the infected with LD
      parasite develop disease within one year of diagnosis. Malnutrition and intestinal helminth
      infection have been found to be associated with the risk of active VL. Down regulation of Th1
      cellular immune response confers susceptibility to active VL. Both malnutrition and
      intestinal helminth infection down regulate the Th1 cellular immune response. Till now there
      is no established prophylaxis against active VL among the people exposed to the LD infection.
      Many studies including ours have been shown that periodic regular deworming reduced
      malnutrition significantly. Micronutrient such as zinc and iron as well vitamin A
      supplementation also improve malnutrition and may enhance Th1 cellular immune response. Thus
      we hypothesize that periodic deworming and. micronutrient and vitamin A supplementation
      together may reduce the risk of active VL among the people exposed to the LD infection.

      The study will be carried out in the Harirampur union, Trishal, Mymensingh. This area is
      highly endemic for VL. Two hundred asymptomatic VL patients aged 2-60 will be enrolled to the
      study. Children aged less than 2 years, pregnant women, active VL case, person with chronic
      disease, disable individuals and those who will refuse written consent will not be enrolled
      to the study. After enrollment subjects will be divided into two groups through

      group) and other group will receive placebo (placebo group). Two groups will be followed for
      12 months through active surveillance for developing of active VL. In addition morbidity
      data, monthly stool sampling, monthly anthropometry, urine and blood sampling at baseline,
      before and after treatment of active VL will be carried out Successful completion of the
      study and derived results from it will provide useful information that whether periodic
      deworming with micronutrient and vitamin A supplementation can reduce the risk of active VL

      Obesity causes frailty in obese older adults by exacerbating the age-related decline in
      physical function. However, appropriate management of obesity in older adults is
      controversial. Weight loss without exercise could worsen frailty by accelerating the usual

NCT01061047,Comparison of Ertapenem Distribution in the Muscle of Six Healthy Volunteers and Six Critically Ill Patients by Microdialysis,"
      Ertapenem is an antibiotic that is highly bound to plasma protein (> 95%). The effects of
      this high protein binding on tissue distribution of antibiotics have been few evaluated yet.

      In this study, two groups of subjects will be compared: 6 healthy volunteers and 6 critically
      ill patients (patients with infection due to an Ertapenem susceptible bacteria). Indeed,
      these 2 populations show changes in binding capacity of drugs to plasma proteins due to a
      decrease of protidaemia and of the affinity of drugs to transport proteins.

      It seems therefore important to clarify the consequences of a modification in protein binding
      on distribution of antibiotics. That's why we have decided to characterize tissue
      distribution of ertapenem in healthy volunteers and critically ill patients by assessing:
      free and total concentrations in plasma and free concentrations in muscle by microdialysis.

      Studies evaluating response to bronchodilation in flow-volume spirometry and/or by forced
      oscillations technique (FOT), have been conduced in subjects with obstructive airways
      diseases. Less is known about bronchodilation responses, assessed by both spirometry and FOT
      in healthy young subjects.

      The purpose of the present study is

        1. to determine the range of the bronchodilation response in terms of changes in selected
           spirometric parameters in healthy non-smoking young adults, for identifying normal
           response after an inhaled bronchodilatory agent versus placebo, and its anthropometric
           and spirometric determinants

        2. to determine the range and characteristics of bronchodilation response using
           pseudorandom FOT in healthy non-smoking young adults, for identifying normal response
           after an inhaled bronchodilatory agent versus placebo, and its anthropometric and
           oscillometric determinants.

        3. to compare and correlate eventual changes in spirometric and oscillometric parameters.

      The investigators hypothesize that exists a normal variation in spirometric and oscillometric
      parameters after bronchodilation, and that these parameters are correlated.

      This randomized phase II trial studies temozolomide, radiation therapy, and cediranib maleate
      to see how well they work compared with temozolomide, radiation therapy, and a placebo in
      treating patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma (a type of brain tumor). Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,
      either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high
      energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Cediranib maleate may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor.
      It is not yet known whether temozolomide and radiation therapy are more effective when given
      with or without cediranib maleate in treating glioblastoma.

NCT01062932,Investigation of Cycloserine as a Smoking Cessation Treatment,"
      Psychosocial treatments for drug abuse benefit some patients (Rawson et al 2004), but there
      is an urgent need for new treatment approaches that can improve treatment outcomes. One new
      approach involves facilitation of extinction of conditioned responses through the use of
      d-cycloserine, a partial agonist at the NMDA glycine site. This approach has proved useful
      for the treatment of several anxiety disorders. For example, treatment with d-cycloserine
      enhanced the efficacy of behavioral treatments for acrophobia (Ressler et al 2004) and social
      phobia (Hofmann et al 2006) by enhancing extinction of conditioned fear responses. This
      suggests that d-cycloserine has potential to enhance the efficacy of behavioral treatments
      for drug dependence by enhancing extinction of conditioned responses to drug cues. In this
      Phase I Cutting-Edge Basic Research Awards (CEBRA) application we propose a proof-of-concept
      study to examine effects of treatment with d-cycloserine for facilitating extinction of
      craving provoked by exposure to cigarette smoking cues. The benefits of this treatment
      approach together with cognitive behavioral treatment for reducing cigarette smoking will
      then be determined. Smoking cues will be presented using an established virtual reality
      simulator(Bordnick et al 2004; Bordnick et al 2005a)

      dexamethasone. We hypothesize that anti-emetics with a different mechanism of action than the
      prophylactic regimen will be the most effective ""rescue therapy"" in children having surgery
      in an ambulatory surgery center.

        1. Problem: Despite commonly-used anti-emetics for prophylaxis, some children still go on
           to develop post-operative vomiting (POV).

           Goal: To determine which anti-emetic--ondansetron, metoclopramide, diphenhydramine, or

      Chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis is the inflammation of the oral mucous membranes, which
      are tissues that line the mouth. Oral mucositis is caused when chemotherapy attacks and kills
      the rapidly-dividing cells in the oral mucous membranes. This condition feels like sunburn
      (or heartburn) on the mucous tissues, and often leads to sores in the mouth or on the tongue.
      This can cause discomfort, pain, difficulties in eating, and a longer hospital stay. Several
      therapies appear to either prevent or reduce the severity of mouth ulcers caused by
      chemotherapy for multiple myeloma. Different strategies are used to try and prevent this
      condition; a small number of trials found that some of these strategies may be effective.
      None of the trials had compared head to head the use of saline solution (our standard of

      Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) has been the standard therapy for local advanced rectal
      cancer. Pathological complete response (pCR) is an important prognostic factor for local
      control and survival. A high intensity CRT increases not only the pCR rate, but also
      toxicity, especially diarrhea. Compared with traditional RT technique, intensity-modified
      radiation therapy (IMRT) can decrease the toxicity of diarrhea because of low volume of high
      dose for small bowel. Therefore, IMRT technique provides an opportunity to improve the dose
      intensity of neoadjuvant CRT. The investigators hypothesize that a higher treatment dose
      induces a high rate of pCR and design a two-arm trial. in this trial, low intensity CRT
      includes the whole pelvic irradiation of 50Gy together with Oxaliplatin and Capecitabine
      weekly. While in high intensity group, additional concomitant 5Gy for primary tumor and a

      This is an interventional study aimed at reducing multi-drug resistance and infections in
      nursing home (NH) residents. Each year, a staggering 1.5-2.0 million infections occur in NHs.
      Many of these infections are caused by multiple drug resistant organisms (MDROs) including
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE),
      and multidrug resistant Gram-negative bacilli (R-GNB). Antimicrobial resistance among common
      bacteria are adversely affecting the clinical course and exponentially increasing healthcare
      costs. Recognizing a need for action, legislators, policy makers, and consumer groups are
      advocating for pathogen-based universal preemptive screening for these MDROs, particularly
      MRSA in hospitals and NHs. However, implementing this sweeping mandate is controversial,
      costly, reactive, and not based on empirical evidence. It can result in a 10-20-fold increase
      in the number of NH residents placed in isolation precautions with the potential for reduced
      attention by healthcare workers, isolation and functional decline. The investigators proposal
      evaluates a novel focused approach between 'do nothing' and 'search all and destroy'

NCT01066949,Behavioral Intervention and Adherence in Dialysis,"
      The aim of the proposed work is to conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluation of
      a behavior change intervention designed to enhance fluid-intake adherence (compliance) among
      hemodialysis patients. Patient non-adherence (non-compliance) with fluid-intake restrictions
      is a highly pervasive problem in the hemodialysis population with substantial consequences in
      terms of increased patient morbidity and mortality. Given the prevalence and clinical
      importance of adherence among ESRD patients, the design and evaluation of interventions to
      improve patient adherence is critically important. Surprisingly, however, little such
      empirical work has been conducted in this area.

      The proposed RCT involves testing the efficacy of a behaviorally based, group-administered,
      ""behavioral self regulation"" intervention designed to increase adherence to fluid intake
      restrictions among hemodialysis patients. This structured intervention is designed to be
      delivered by healthcare providers in a clinical setting to groups of 4-10 patients over
      seven, one-hour weekly sessions. This study will compare the effect of the structured
      intervention group with the effect of an educational and support group on fluid-intake
      adherence in a sample of approximately 200 fluid non-adherent center hemodialysis patients
      over a 26-week follow-up period. Both clinical (interdialysis session weight gain) and
      self-report indices of fluid-intake adherence will be examined. We believe that the proposed
      research is of potentially very high impact given the high prevalence and clear clinical
      consequences of hemodialysis patient nonadherence and the potential for a relatively
      low-cost, structured intervention to significantly reduce this type of maladaptive patient
      behavior in the hemodialysis treatment context.

NCT01061112,Effects of Genotype on CYP2C9 Drug Interactions,"
      This research study will help determine how a person's genetic makeup affects their responses
      to drugs, the ability of the body to break down drugs, and their potential to experience an
      interaction between drugs. We are investigating the drug interactions between an antifungal
      drug called fluconazole and the commonly used drugs tolbutamide, flurbiprofen, and
      ketoprofen. Tolbutamide is used for management of Type 2 diabetes. Both flurbiprofen and
      ketoprofen are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) often used for arthritis or
      pain. We are interested in studying whether individuals with certain genetic profiles have
      different drug interactions than normal. This research is being done to see if certain
      genetic profiles require us to adjust medication doses differently than is needed for the
      general population. Genetic profiles of subjects are determined from their previous
      participation in the Pharmacogenetics Registry (Investigator Richard Brundage, University of
      Minnesota).

      The study hypothesis is: Fraction metabolized by CYP2C9 enzyme determines the extent of drug
      interactions in CYP2C9*1/*1 individuals but this factor (fraction metabolized) becomes less
      influential and drug interactions are attenuated in a gene-dose dependent manner in
      individuals with one or more defective alleles.

NCT01068691,Arterial Properties of Thoracic Aorta Disease,"
      A dissecting or intramural haematoma of the thoracic aorta (AH) is a haemorrhage that
      dissects the aortic wall. An entry point is detected at an intimal tear, ulcer or plaque
      rupture via imaging in almost 50% of cases. AH occurs in older patients than those with AD
      and develops on atheromatous lesions with parietal ulcers, most often in cases of poorly
      managed, pre-existing hypertension (HTN). Type A AHs, which affect the ascending aorta,
      frequently progress towards an AD with a high risk of mortality, and represent a surgical
      indication.

      Patients who have presented AD or AH, whether they have been operated or not, must undergo
      prolonged monitoring. This involves both clinical and radiological checks to ensure that
      blood pressure is properly monitored, that the parietal lesions have receded and that there
      are no complications.

      HTN is a recognized risk factor for the onset of AD and systolic blood pressure must be
      brought down to between 100 and 120 mmHg perioperatively. Furthermore, HTN is also a risk
      factor for the rupture of unoperated type B AD. Despite this, only two studies have looked at
      BP management in AD patients. The first, carried out among chronic type A or B AD patients
      revealed that closer monitoring of blood pressure levels at home led to a better long-term
      prognosis. Another study revealed a 60% prevalence of non-managed clinical HTN among 40
      chronic AD patients.

      Whilst frequent, regular aortic wall monitoring via imaging methods (CT or MRI) is
      recommended after thoracic AD surgery, there is no precise recommendation as to the method of
      BP monitoring in very high-risk patients. A BP level of 135/80 mmHg has been suggested as a
      maximum limit for patients having been operated for AD. In order to achieve this,
      antihypertensives of several therapeutic classes must be used, with beta-blockers as a
      priority. The same can be said for AH, as it has been demonstrated that the absence of
      beta-blocker treatment is a predictive factor for poor progress.

      Increased aortic stiffness can cause increased systolic blood pressure and is recognized as
      an independent cardiovascular risk factor. This stiffness can be detected by measuring the
      carotid-to-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV). No study has as yet focused on assessing aortic
      stiffness in patients who have undergone AD or AH surgery.

      Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) in thoracic AD patients is highly prevalent, and
      respiratory events that occur are more severe. This has prompted some to suggest that
      systematic detection of OSAS after AD should be carried out. No findings have yet been
      published about patients who have undergone AH surgery.

      that blocks abnormally active signaling enzymes called ""tyrosine kinases"" which are important
      to the growth of GIST. This ""tyrosine kinase inhibition"" is similar to the way that both
      imatinib and sunitinib work; however, regorafenib blocks certain additional signaling
      pathways that are not blocked by imatinib or sunitinib. Regorafenib has been not been tested
      in GIST participants before this research study.

NCT01068886,External Pancreatic Duct Stent After Pancreaticoduodenectomy,"
      Pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) is performed in many high volume centers with a very low
      mortality. Reduced mortality rate is largely the result of careful patient selection,
      improved intraoperative management and a better postoperative care. Unfortunately, there is
      not a similar reduction in morbidity rates which remains about 40%. Persistent morbidity is
      predominantly due to pancreatic fistula (PF). Abdominal abscess and hemorrhage are common
      sequelae of PF which have been associated with a high mortality rate. While many different
      risk factors have been reported, a soft pancreatic texture and a nondilated pancreatic duct
      have been most consistently linked to high rates of PF. A number of methods for reducing the
      incidence of PF have been proposed and analysed. Many of these involve technical features of
      the anastomosis, including site of reconstruction, anastomotic technique, use of biologic
      glue, and prophylactic use of somatostatin analogue. The placement of a stent through the
      pancreatic anastomosis is an attractive strategy to reduce the PF rate. This multicenter
      prospective randomized trial was designed to compare the outcome after PD with external
      drainage stent versus no stent in patients with high risk of PF (with soft pancreas and a
      diameter of wirsung <3mm).

      Analysis:The primary objective of the study was to compare the incidence PF in patients with
      or without external pancreatic stent. With an anticipated PF rate of 30%, based on literature
      experience, it was calculated that a reduction to 10% of PF rate would require the inclusion
      of 75 patients in each group (statistical significance P < 0.05 and power 80 per cent with a
      two-tailed test of proportions). We'll enroll 158 patients to take into account the
      possibility of 5% being lost to follow-up.

NCT01069562,Closed Loop Isoflurane Administration With Bispectral Index in Open Heart Surgery,"
      With the advancement in microprocessor technology and better understanding of
      pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of anaesthetic agents, computer facilitated closed loop
      control of anaesthesia using propofol has been shown to be accurate with better performance
      than manual control. Literature on computer controlled administration of inhalational
      anaesthetics is few, as it requires the computer to control the dial setting on the
      vapouriser. The investigators intend to compare the computer controlled closed loop
      administration of isoflurane by infusing it into the anaesthetic circuit with conventional
      vaporiser control in elective open heart surgery.

      40 patients (ASA (American Society of Anesthesiology) class II-IV; 18- 65 years) undergoing
      elective cardiac surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) will be randomly divided into
      manual or closed loop groups. Propofol will be used for induction of anaesthesia in both
      groups followed by isoflurane for maintenance. In the manual group, isoflurane will be
      administered through the Tech 7 vapouriser during pre and post CPB periods to target
      bispectral index (BIS) of 50. In closed loop group, isoflurane will be administered using
      infusion of liquid isoflurane into expiratory limb of the closed circuit. This rate of
      infusion though a conventional syringe pump will be controlled by algorithm termed
      'Improvised Anaesthetic Agent Delivery System' (IAADS) to maintain BIS of 50. Patients in
      both groups will receive 500ml of 100 % oxygen as fresh gas flow. The % of time bispectral
      index (BIS) is within the 10 of set target BIS of 50 will be the primary outcome measure. The
      secondary outcome measures will be median performance error (MDPE)(2), median absolute
      performance error (MDAPE)(2), wobble(2), divergence(2), amount of isoflurane used and
      hemodynamic parameters will be secondary outcome measures.

      The triple therapy darunavir/r + tenofovir/emtricitabine is likely to become a relevant
      first-line treatment option in the years to come. The dual combination of boosted darunavir +

      drugs, one of which belongs to a new drug class (integrase inhibitor). The expected efficacy
      profile of this combination is promising. Moreover, this combination might have a better
      tolerance profile and has the advantage of sparing the NRTI class.

      In the context of tenofovir/emtricitabine currently being a reference backbone in first-line

NCT01066975,Mechanical Load on the Shoulders While Carrying a Backpack- Towards a Knowledge-Based Backpack Design,"
      Soldiers and recreational backpackers are often required to carry heavy loads on their body
      during military operations or hiking. Despite the advances in backpack design, the loads
      carried by soldiers still impose an extreme physiological strain (soft tissue deformation)
      which frequently results in discomfort, pain,musculoskeletal injuries, and loss sensorimotor
      function.

      In the current study, characterization of the pressures, evaluation of the deformations of
      the soft tissues, specifically the fat, muscles, Brachial plexus and subclavian vessels
      applied on the shoulder while sitting with a heavy backpack will performed. The data acquired
      in the current trials will be used for development of a finite element (FE) 3D shoulder
      model. The purpose is to better understand the mechanical loads that are being transferred to
      the underlying tissue below the shoulder straps during walking/marching with a backpack.
      During the 2nd phase of this project, data collected during this research will be used to
      develop gear that will alleviate the strain on the shoulders, prevent injury, and enhance
      performance.

      Hypothesis

        -  High focal strain (hot-spots) on the shoulder tissue that are observed with the pressure
           mapping will be observed also in the MR scans.

        -  The strain at those hot-spots can be reduced by personal-geometry adjusted straps.

      Volunteers

      Five young (18-30 yrs), healthy, and fit males will participate in this study.

      Trials design

        1. MR Scans- The scan will be performed for analysis of personal shoulder anatomy, and will
           be used for developing a 3D FE model. The sagittal view will be used to develop the 3D
           model. The coronal and axial sectional views will be used to assess the deformations
           applied on the shoulder tissue. The scan will then be repeated while carrying a 25 kg
           standard commercial backpack while sitting in the same position, for the assessment of
           shoulder girdle tissues deformations. Time estimation for each scan is 40 min (80 min
           total). The subjects are not required to carry the backpack prior to those scans.

        2. Static pressure measurement- each volunteer will be asked to sit for 30 seconds while
           carrying the 25 kg backpack. During this session, pressure will be measured using a
           pressure mapping pad (Sensor Products Inc., USA) placed between the shoulder strap and
           the underlying tissue.

      The maximal total participation time of each volunteer will be 2 hours total (inside and
      outside the MR).

      Data acquired in the current trials will be used for the development of a FE (finite element)
      3D shoulder model. MR scans will be utilized for composing geometry and for the boundary
      conditions assessment (strain magnitude). Pressure measurements will be used as boundary
      conditions (stress magnitude).

      compared to bone marrow tissue. In this trial, eligible liver cirrhosis patients will receive
      autologous adipose tissue derived stromal cells through intrahepatic arterial
      catheterization.

NCT01066169,Vaccination Response in ImmunoCompromised Host. Immune Response After Vaccination Against Pandemic A/H1N1 Influenza,"
      As recommended by the Dutch Health Council, certain risk groups and health care workers in
      The Netherlands were vaccinated to prevent morbidity due to pandemic influenza A/H1N1. Adults
      were vaccinated twice with the monovalent influenza A/California/2009(H1N1) MF59-adjuvanted
      surface-antigen vaccine Focetria® (Novartis). The vaccination campaign was executed by
      general practitioners.

      The aim of the study is to verify whether HIV-infected individuals generate an adequate
      immune response after the first and after the second vaccination.
